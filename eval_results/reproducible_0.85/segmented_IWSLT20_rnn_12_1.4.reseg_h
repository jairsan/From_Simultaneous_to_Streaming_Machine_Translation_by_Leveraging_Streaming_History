A couple of years ago Here at TED , Peter Skillman launched a design competition called &quot; The Marshmallow Challenge . 
&quot; The idea is . It &apos;s pretty simple . Four teams have to have the widest possible freestanding structure with 20 spaghetti . CA : 1m tape . CA : 1m thread . And build a marshmallow , 
the marshmallow has to be up on top . 
And though it really seems simple , it &apos;s really really hard because it &apos;s pushing people to work together very quickly . 
And so I thought this was an interesting idea . And I put it into a design workshop . 
It was a huge success . 
Since then , I &apos;ve been doing about 70 workshops around the world . With students , developers and architects , even CTOs , the Fortune 50 companies , and there &apos;s something about this task . What deep impressions into nature . It allows cooperation , and I want to share some of these with you . 
Normally , most people start themselves with the task of orienting themselves . 
They talk about it . They think about what it will look like . They &apos;re rangling for power . 
Then they invest a little time in planning . And organization . They sketch . And they put spaghetti out . 
They invest a lot of their time in assembly . Constantly growing structures . 
And finally , just before they have no time , someone takes the Marshmallow . And they gently put it on the top , step . One step back and admire TA @-@ da . You admire your work . 
But then what ? Almost . It &apos;s always the case that the TA @-@ da becomes an UH @-@ Oh , because the weight of the Marshmallow causes the whole thing to bend and collapse , 
there are a number of people who have much more UH @-@ Oh moments than others . And among the worst are freshest BWL graduates . 
They lie , they cheat . They &apos;re confused . And they produce really poor entities . 
And of course , there are teams that have much more TA @-@ DA formations . And among the best are freshness graduates of the kindergarten , 
and that &apos;s quite amazing . 
As Peter told us , they not only produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all . 
What you might ask is , how does that come ? Why ? What about those ? 
And Peter doesn &apos;t tell one . The kids spend time in it . Head of Spaghetti GmbH . They 
don &apos;t invest time in power struggles . 
But there &apos;s another reason , 
and that &apos;s because BWL students were trained to do a proper plan . OK . 
And then to realize 
what happens . If you put the Marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time anymore . And what happens ? 
It &apos;s a crisis . 
Sounds familiar . What do 
kindergarten kids do differently ? Is that they start with the Marshmallow ? And prototypes build successful prototypes . Always with the Marshmallow at the top . So they have the opportunity to have multiple repair of dilapidated prototypes . 
Constructors recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of an iterative process . 
And with every attempt , the kids get immediate feedback . What works and what doesn &apos;t work . 
So the performance of working with prototypes is like : Essential . But let &apos;s see how different teams operate . 
The average for most is about 50 centimeters . BWL students create half of it . Lawyers , a little bit more . But not much . Kindergarten kids are better than adults . 
Who &apos;s most successful ? 
Architects . And engineers , luckily . 
1M : Is the highest ? What I &apos;ve seen 
and why ? Because you understand triangles . And self @-@ reinforcing geometric patterns are the key to building stable structures . 
CEOs are slightly above average . But here it gets interesting . 
You put an executive administrator on the team , they get significantly better . 
It &apos;s incredible . You look around and you see this team will win . You 
can predict that . Why is that ? 
Because you have special process monitoring skills . 
You run the process . You understand it . 
And that team that controls and works with care will be performance of the team significantly improving . 
Specialized skills and process skills and their combination will be successful . 
If you have 10 teams that are typical , you get . CA : 6 : Stable structures . 
I tried something exciting . 
I thought , let &apos;s get the poker bet right . 
So I offered a $ 10,000 prize for the winners software . 
What do you think happened ? With these design students , 
what was the result ? 
This didn &apos;t happen . A team had a stable structure . 
If anyone had a two @-@ inch construction , he would have built the prize home , it &apos;s home . 
So it &apos;s not interesting that high betting has a strong effect . 
We repeated this exercise with the same students . 
What do you think ? Did it happen ? 
Well , you understood the advantage of prototyping . 
So it turned out to be the same bad team . One of the best ones , 
they made the highest construction in the least time . 
So there are profound lessons for us about the nature of propulsion and success . 
You may ask . Why would someone actually invest time ? Creating a Marshmallow Challenge , 
the reason is , I &apos;m helping create digital tools and processes to help teams . Cars , video games and visual effects . 
And what the Marshmallow Challenge does is it helps you identify hidden assumptions . 
Because frankly , every project has its own Marshmallow . The challenge is to 
have a shared experience . A common language or attitude , the right prototype to 
build . And this is the value of this experience . This simple exercise , 
and those of you who are interested in it , can do 
it . MarshmallowChallenge . COM : Visit : It &apos;s a blog where you can see . How to build the Marshmallows . 
There &apos;s a step @-@ by @-@ step guide there . 
You can find crazy examples from all over the world . How people optimize the system ? 
And refinement : There are also world records . 
And the basal lesson , I think , is the construction . In fact , a connecting sport is that 
it requires that we put all our senses on the task . And that we use our thinking optimally , like our emotions . And our actions in the challenge that lies ahead of us , 
and sometimes a small prototype . This experience , everything it takes . We &apos;re from an UH @-@ Oh to a TA @-@ DA moment , 
and that can make a big difference . 
Thank you very much . 
Let &apos;s pretend we have a machine , 
a big machine . A cool TED @-@ like machine , and that &apos;s a time machine . 
And everybody in this room has to go in , 
and you can go into the past . You can go into the future . You can &apos;t go into the here 
and now . And I wonder what you &apos;re choosing . Would you , because I &apos;ve been doing this with my friends a lot lately ? And I asked this question , and they all wanted to go into the past . 
I don &apos;t know . They wanted to go back to time before cars were there or Twitter or America is looking for the superstar . 
I don &apos;t know . 
I &apos;m convinced that somehow you can go to nostalgia , wishful thinking . 
And I understand that . 
I &apos;m not part of this group , I have to say . 
I don &apos;t want to go back to the past , and not because I &apos;m an adventurer . 
It &apos;s because opportunities on this planet are not going back . They &apos;re going forward . 
So I want to go into this machine . And I want to go into the future . 
This is the greatest time it &apos;s ever been on this planet . No matter what scale you &apos;re applying . Health , wealth . Mobility , opportunities , falling rates of disease . 
There has never been a time like this before . 
My great grandparents all died when they were 60 . 
My grandparents pushed this number to 70 . 
My parents are 80 on their heels . 
So there should be a nine at the beginning of my death . 
But it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing . When this is 
a kid born today in New Delhi , you can expect to live as long as the richest man on earth . 100 years ago , 
think about it . This is an incredible fact . 
And why is this ? 
Skirts , smallpox , have billions of people on the planet killed . 
They &apos;ve got the demographics of the Earth . In a way , they &apos;ve redesigned it in a way that no war . Ever managed to do 
it . They &apos;re gone . They &apos;ve disappeared . 
We &apos;ve defeated them . Puff 
in the rich world : There are diseases . The millions of us , just a generation ago , who have threatened . Hardly any 
diphtheria is rubbing polio . 
Does it know at all ? Somebody else , what that is ? 
Vaccines . Modern medicine . Our ability to feed billions of people . These are successes of the scientific method , 
and in my view , the scientific method is to try things out . Look if it works . It changes if it doesn &apos;t . One of the greatest achievements of humanity , 
that &apos;s the good news . 
Unfortunately , that &apos;s the good news . Because there are some other problems . And they &apos;ve been mentioned many times . 
And one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people in the world are hungry to bed every day . If 
that number goes up , and it goes up very quickly . And that &apos;s embarrassing . 
And not just that . We have used our imagination to do that . We have used this world to 
thoroughly devastate : Drinking water , primal land , rainforests , oil , gas . They disappear soon . And if we don &apos;t innovate out of this chaos , they disappear . We also ask 
the question is , can we do that ? I think so . 
I think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food . The billions of people who feed without the land they live on will feed without rape . 
I think we can use energy to power this world . They can &apos;t destroy it at the same time . 
I really think so . And no . This is not wishful thinking . 
But this is keeping me awake at night . One of the things that keeps me awake at night is that we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as much as we &apos;ve never done before . And 
we &apos;ve never been able to do it reasonably . We used to use it as we can today . 
We &apos;re on the threshold of amazing things . Amazing events . Many areas . And yet , I really think we &apos;ve been hundreds of 300 years before the Enlightenment had to go back to find a time . In which we &apos;ve been fighting progress where we &apos;ve been more vigorously pushing these things . More fronts than we have now . 
People are wrapping themselves in their faith . And so tightly , you don &apos;t get rid of them . 
Not even the truth is going to happen . They get rid of them 
and hear them . Everybody has a right to their opinion . Even a right to their opinion on progress . 
But you know what they don &apos;t have a right to , 
they don &apos;t have a right to their own facts . You don &apos;t have a charge . 
And I took a while to figure out about this 
about a decade ago . I have an article about vaccines for The New Yorker , a little article , 
and I was amazed at encountering resistance , resistance to resistance to what was ultimately what the most effective measure . In healthcare , in the history of humanity , 
I didn &apos;t know what to do . So I just did what I always do . I wrote an article and I went on . 
And soon afterwards , I wrote an article on genetically modified foods , the 
same thing . Only bigger . 
People were crazy . 
So I also have written an article about it . And I couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that was frankenfood . Why did they think molecules were on a certain , rather than a random , way to move around , an attack on the territory of nature 
? But you know , I do what ? I do . I wrote the article . I went on . 
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist . 
We type , we type , we reach . We go eating . That &apos;s okay . 
But these articles worried me . And I couldn &apos;t figure out . Why ? And finally , I found out . 
And that &apos;s because these fanatics who mad me . No fanatics at all . 
These were prudent people . Educated people , decent people . 
They were just like the people in this room . 
And that got me so confused . 
But then I thought , &quot; You know what ? Let &apos;s be honest . 
We &apos;re at a point where we &apos;re not at the same relationship to progress . As we used to talk . 
Intermediate . We &apos;re talking ironically 
about it with small quotes . So progress , 
okay ? There are reasons for that . And I think we know what reasons that are . 
We have trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , lost . And there &apos;s no reason . Why ? That &apos;s not . That &apos;s what 
you should be like . You can just name a few names . And people will understand . 
Chernobyl , Bhopal , Challenger , Vioxx , weapons of mass destruction , the 2000 US presidential election . I mean , 
you know , you can choose your own list . 
There are questions . And problems with the people we thought we were always right with , you know ? So be skeptical . 
Ask questions : Ask for evidence . Ask evidence . 
Don &apos;t take evidence for granted . 
But now it &apos;s when you get evidence , you have to accept that evidence . And that &apos;s not good at us . 
And I can do that for the reason that we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear , as I still do never see you . And hopefully never again , 
about 12 years ago , a story was published . A terrible story . The Autism epidemic with measles , mumps and rubbles , linked vaccine . 
Very scary , 
uplifting , in some ways , studies were done to see if that was true , 
upward studies . This is a serious matter . 
The data came in , 
the data came in , from the United States , from England , from Sweden , from Canada , and they were all the same , no correlation . No connection , no connection at all . 
It makes no difference . It makes no difference because we believe in anecdotes . We believe what we see . What we believe to see , what causes us to feel real . 
We don &apos;t believe in a bundle of documents from a government agency that gives us data . And I understand that . I think we all do that . 
But you know what ? 
The result of that was catastrophic . 
Catastrophic because of that fact . The United States is one of the only countries in the world . In which the vaccine rate for measles is falling , 
that &apos;s scandalous . And we should be ashamed . 
It &apos;s terrible . 
What happened ? That we could do that . 
Well , I understand that . That &apos;s what I do . Because here 
&apos;s somebody who has measles , 
has one in the audience . Anyone who sees someone die of measles 
doesn &apos;t happen very often . 
In this country , not at all . But 160,000 times in the world . Last year . 
These are many deaths from measles : 20 per hour . 
But because this hasn &apos;t happened here , we can displace it . And people like Jenny McCarthy can walk around . And messages of fear . And illiteracy of platforms like Oprah and Larry King preach live . And 
you can do that . Because they don &apos;t connect cause and correlation . 
They don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same . But almost never . The same thing is , 
and this is something we need to learn . And it &apos;s very fast . 
This guy was a hero . Jonas Salk : 
He liberated us from one of the worst scourges of humanity . Don &apos;t worry 
, no pain , polio . Puff disappeared . 
The guy in the middle , not so much . 
His name is Paul Offit . 
He &apos;s just got with a few other people a rotavirus vaccine . 
He can live the lives of 400 , 500,000 children a year . In the developing world , it &apos;s 
pretty good to save . 
Not now . That &apos;s good . Apart from Paul walking around talking about vaccines and saying , &quot; How valuable they are . &quot; And that people should just stop . Complaining , 
and he actually says that , 
so Paul is a terrorist . 
If Paul is speaking at a public hearing , he cannot speak without armed guards . 
He gets calls at home because people like to tell him they know where his kids are going to school . 
And why ? Because Paul made a vaccine . 
I don &apos;t need that . Say , but vaccines are essential . 
Take them away . Returning the diseases back , terrible diseases . And that &apos;s what &apos;s happening right now . 
We have in this country now measles , 
and that &apos;s getting worse . And pretty soon , kids will die of it again . Because this is just a question of numbers . 
And they &apos;re not just going to die of measles . 
What about polio ? Let &apos;s take that . Why not ? 
A fellow militant of mine told me a few weeks ago . And she said , &quot; She thinks I &apos;m a little too shrill . 
Nobody has ever said that before . 
&quot; She wouldn &apos;t fight polio against her child . She wouldn &apos;t be 
fine at all . 
Why ? Because we don &apos;t have polio . And you know what ? 
We had in this country yesterday no polio . 
Today , I don &apos;t know . Maybe this morning somebody in Lagos got on an airplane and is flying to Los Angeles . He &apos;s over Ohio right 
now . And in a few hours he lands . And he rents a car . And he comes to Long Beach , and he becomes one of these fantastic TED dinner . And he &apos;s going to visit tonight , 
and he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s infected with a paralyzing disease . And we don &apos;t know . Because that &apos;s how the world works . 
Well , this is the planet on which we live . It &apos;s not as if it &apos;s not . 
We love lying in lies . We love having that . 
You all have taken your vitamins this morning : 
Echinacea , a small antioxidant . That &apos;s helping you jump . 
I know you &apos;ve done that because half of Americans have done that every day . 
You take the stuff , and you take alternative remedies , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference . How often we find that they &apos;re useless ? 
The data constantly records that . 
They evaporate their urine . They do more . Never before . 
That &apos;s okay . They like to spend 28 billion dollars on dark urine . 
I totally agree with you : 
Dark urine , dark . 
Why do we do that ? Why do we do that ? 
Well , I think I understand , we hate the pharmaceutical industry . 
We hate too strong a government . We don &apos;t have confidence in the system . 
And we shouldn &apos;t . Our healthcare system is bad . 
It &apos;s cruel to millions of people . 
It &apos;s absolutely amazing cold . And soulful , even to us who can afford it . 
So we &apos;re walking away from it , and where are we going ? 
We &apos;re walking into the arms of the placebo industry . 
That &apos;s great . I love the placebo industry . 
But you know , this is really a serious matter . Because the stuff is crap . And we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it . 
And I have all sorts of little props . 
None of them here : Gingko was cheating , Echinacea was cheating , Acai . I don &apos;t even know what that is . But we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it . It &apos;s cheating . 
And you know what ? When I say that , people scream at me and say , &quot; What cares you ? &quot; &quot; Let people do what they want . 
&quot; So they feel good . And 
you know what ? They &apos;re wrong 
because I don &apos;t care . Whether it &apos;s the Health Minister who says , &quot; Hmm , I &apos;m going to not take the evidence of my experts on mammography or any cancer quack salver who wants to treat his patients with coffee intakes . 
&quot; If you go down that path , where faith and magic prove . And science replace , you get to a place where you &apos;re not willing to be . 
You get to Thabo Mbeki in South Africa . 
He brought 400,000 of his people around because he insisted that red beds , garlic and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs . We know they &apos;re going to be the ones that can slow down the course of AIDS . 
Hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country worse than any other country plagued by this disease . 
Please don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences . 
They have them . They always have the 
most brain @-@ free epidemic we &apos;re in right now . Is this absurd battle between the advocates of genetically modified food and the bio @-@ elite ? 
This is an idiotic debate . It has to stop . 
It &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors . 
This is ideology , not science . 
Everything we eat . Every grain of rice . Every branch of parsley . Every sprouts has been changed by people . 
You know , there were no mandarin in paradise . 
There were no cantaloupe melons . There were no Christmas trees . We did all of that . 
We did it in the last 11,000 years . 
And some of it worked . And some of it didn &apos;t . 
We got rid of it . What didn &apos;t work 
now we can make it more accurate . And of course , there are risks . But we can do something like vitamin A in rice . And the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people . Extending their lives . 
They don &apos;t want that . 
I have to say , &quot; I understand . I don &apos;t . 
&quot; We reject genetically modified food . 
Why do we do that ? 
Well , what I hear all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture . We don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing . That &apos;s wrong . 
We don &apos;t want companies to patent lives . 
We don &apos;t want companies to own seeds . 
And you know what ? My answer to all of that is 
yes . You &apos;re right . Fix . We do . 
It &apos;s true . We have a huge food problem . But that &apos;s not science . 
That &apos;s not science . 
It &apos;s morality . Patent stuff . 
You know that science is not a company . 
It &apos;s not a country . 
It &apos;s not even an idea . It &apos;s a process . 
It &apos;s a process . And sometimes it works . And sometimes it doesn &apos;t . But the idea that we don &apos;t want to allow science to do its work because we &apos;re afraid is a real impasse . And it keeps millions of people from flourishing . 
You know , over the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food . When at the moment , 70 percent of 
this investment in Africa over the last 30 years has 
been shameful , shameful . 
You need that . And we &apos;re not giving it to you . 
And why genetically modified food ? 
We don &apos;t want to encourage people . This rotten stuff to eat , like Maniok Maniok , is 
something that &apos;s half a billion people eat . 
It &apos;s like a potato . 
It &apos;s just a bunch of calories . It &apos;s bad . 
It doesn &apos;t have nutrients . It doesn &apos;t have protein . And scientists are building all this right in there . 
And then people could eat that . And wouldn &apos;t become blind . 
They wouldn &apos;t starve . And you know what ? 
That would be nice . It wouldn &apos;t be Chez Panisse . But it would be nice . 
And everything I can say about that is , why do we fight that ? 
I mean , questions . We ask ourselves , why do we fight that ? 
Because we don &apos;t want to push genes around . 
It &apos;s not about pushing genes around . It &apos;s not about chemicals . 
It &apos;s not about our ridiculous ones . It &apos;s about passion for hormones . It &apos;s about insisting on more food . It &apos;s about better food . It &apos;s about unique food . 
It &apos;s not about rice . Crispies , it &apos;s about keeping people alive . And it &apos;s high time to understand what that means . 
Because you know what ? 
If we don &apos;t do that , if we keep on doing what we do . We owe ourselves to something we believe in , I don &apos;t want to be guilty of . High @-@ tech colonialism . 
There &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here . 
It &apos;s selfish . It &apos;s ugly . It &apos;s not worthy of us . And we really have to stop that . 
After this incredibly fun conversation , you might want to say , &quot; Do you still want to be in this ridiculous time machine ? &quot; And go to the future 
anyway . I want to do that anyway . 
She &apos;s in the present moment . But we have an incredible opportunity . 
We can put this time machine on everything we want . 
We can move it where we want to move it . And we will move it there . Where we want , we need to . 
We need to have these conversations , and we need to think . But if we go into the time machine and go into the future , we will be happy . Having done that . 
I know we can . And as far as I &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs now . 
Thank you . 
Thank you . When Steve Lopez , columnist of the Los Angeles Times , one day , walked through the streets in the center of Los Angeles , he heard a wonderful music . 
She came from a man , an African @-@ American , sympathetic , rough , homeless . The guy who played on a violin , who had only two strings left . 
Many of you will know the story . Because from Steve &apos;s article about it , later on , a book became . And that was filmed with Robert Downey Junior . When Steve Lopez and Jamie Foxx were Nathaniel Anthony Ayers , the contrabass player who studied at the Juilliard Conservatory . And tragically early on , his promising career is through his paranoid . Schizophrenia was finished . 
Nathaniel left Juilliard , suffered a nervous breakdown . And 30 years later , he lived as homeless on the streets of Skid Row in the center of Los Angeles . 
I recommend to you all read Steves &apos; book . Or watch the movie . So you can not only understand the wonderful connection that exists between these two men , but also how music is . Making that connection helped and how they eventually became the instrument . If this play of words is allowed , that &apos;s half . Nathaniel , away from the street , to get away . 
I met Mr. Ayers . In 2008 , two years ago , in the Walt Disney Concert Hall . 
He just had a demonstration of Beethoven &apos;s first . And he heard fourth symphony , and he came behind the stage to imagine myself . 
He spoke in a very cheerful and sociable tone about yo @-@ yo . MA : And Hillary Clinton : And about how the Dodgers never made it into the Baseball World Series . And all of this because of the insidious passage of the first violin . In the last sentence of Beethoven &apos;s Fourth Symphony : 
&quot; We came to the theme of speaking music . &quot; And a few days later , I got an email saying that Nathaniel was in favor of violin lessons with me . 
I have to mention that Nathaniel is opposed to medical treatment . Because he was already in the process of electric shocks and thorazine . And handcuffs were treated . Trauma . That &apos;s what he &apos;s been following all 
his life as a result . He &apos;s now particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases . They &apos;re sometimes so bad that they &apos;re threatening to tear him apart . And he &apos;s disappearing for days . In the streets of Skid Row , this horror is always wandering around and the torturing torment of his own mind is exposed to , 
and in exactly the same stage of irritation , Nathaniel was when we were in the Walt Disney Concert Hall with our first lesson . He had this miserable flickering in his eyes . And he was totally lost . 
He talked about invisible demons and smoke , and about how someone in sleep wanted to poison him . 
I was afraid , not for me , but for fear that I could lose him , that he could sink into one of his states . And that I could give him a break in his relationship with the violin . When I started talking about clay ladders and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic . Violin pedagogy . 
So I just started playing . 
I played the first sentence of Beethoven &apos;s violin concerto , 
and as I played , I noticed that in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes , there was a complete change . 
It was as if under the influence of an invisible doctor . It was a chemical reaction of its catalyst . My game was Nathaniels . 
Manian anger turned into understanding , into a calm . Curiosity and grace . 
And as if by a miracle , he took his violin . And he began to listen . Some excerpts of violin concerts to play . And then asked me to finish playing them . Mendelssohn Chaikovsky , Sibelius . 
And we started to talk about music . From Bach to Beethoven . Brahms Bruckner . And all the others . BS : From Bartók to ESA @-@ Pekka Salonen , 
and I realized that he wasn &apos;t just an encyclopaedic knowledge of music , but he was with it also a close personal relationship , and 
he was very much in love with it . He talked about her with passion and understanding . That I would otherwise only talk about my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic . 
Knowing by playing music and talking about music was from this paranoid , confused . Man who was just walking through the streets of Los Angeles . A lovely , educated , excellent musician trained in Juilliard . 
Music is medicine . Music changes us 
for Nathaniel means . Music is mental health , 
because music allows him to think about it . And delusions with the help of his imagination and creativity to transform it into something real . 
And so he escapes his tormenting state . 
I understood that this is exactly the nature of art . 
This is precisely why we make music so that we can do something that is deep inside of us all . Our emotions through our artistic lens , through our creativity , can shape into reality . 
And the reality of that expression reaches us all . And moves , inspires . And unites us what 
Nathaniel was about . So music brought him back to a community of friends . 
The redeeming power of music brought him back . In a family of musicians who understood him , who recognized his talent and respected him , 
and I keep on coming back to playing with Nathaniel . Whether in Walt Disney Concert Hall or in Skid Row , because he reminds me of this . Why ? I became a musician . 
Thank you very much . 
Bruno Giussani : Thank you very much . Thank you . 
Robert Gupta : 
Robert Gupta : I want to play something . I shamefully stolen the cellist , 
and I hope you will forgive me . 
I am Jane McGonigal . I design computer games . 
I &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years now . And my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy . The world in reality to save as it does in online games is 
to save . I have a plan for that . I want to convince more people , including all of you , more time to play bigger ones . And to spend great games . 
We &apos;re spending three billion hours a week now playing online . 
Some of you might think , &quot; This is a lot of time for games . 
Maybe a little too much time . &quot; If you think about how many problems we &apos;re facing in the real world , we &apos;re going to solve them urgently . But 
in fact , I &apos;ve actually done my research at the Institute for the Future , and that &apos;s exactly the opposite . Right ? 
Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to address the world &apos;s most pressing problems . 
In fact , I &apos;m convinced that if we look at the next century on this planet , we want to have to dramatically increase that time . 
I calculated that the time needed was 21 billion hours of playing time a week . 
That might seem a little bit absurd first . So I &apos;ll repeat it with that . It can work if we can have problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity . I think we need to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week by the end of the next decade . 
No . I mean , it &apos;s really serious . 
Why ? This picture 
is pretty accurate . Why ? I think games are so vital to the survival of the human species . In the future , they &apos;re serious . 
This is a portrait of photographer Phil Toledano . 
He wanted to capture the feelings of playing . So he &apos;s in front of the players . He &apos;s built a camera . 
This is one of the classic expressions . 
When playing , if you &apos;re not a player , you may miss some of the nuances in this picture . 
You probably see this sense of urgency , a little fear . But also extreme concentration . It &apos;s deepened . It &apos;s really difficult to solve . 
If you play , you see some nuances . Here &apos;s the upward @-@ drawn eyes and the mouth , which is a sign of optimism . The eyebrows show surprise . 
This is a player on the edge of what &apos;s called an epic victory . 
Oh , you know that . 
OK . Great . So we have some players . Here &apos;s 
an epic victory . Is a result ? It &apos;s so very positive that you didn &apos;t know before that it was possible at all . 
It was almost beyond imagination , and if you reach it , you &apos;re shocked that you &apos;re actually going to be able to do 
that . This is an epic victory . 
This player is about to win an epic victory . 
And this is what we see on millions of faces of problem solvers around the world . If we can overcome the hurdles of the next century , the face of those who face all odds . On the edge of an epic victory . 
Well , unfortunately , we see this face more . In real life , when we face difficult problems . 
I call it that &quot; in life &quot; is . I mean &quot; bad face &quot; . 
And it &apos;s actually &quot; seeing my face &quot; . You know . OK . 
That &apos;s me . How I do that ? In life , I &apos;m bad face . 
This is a graffiti in my former home country . In Berkeley , California , where I studied in my Ph.D. thesis why we &apos;re better at playing than in real life . 
This is a problem . This is a problem that many players have . 
We think in reality we &apos;re not as good as in play . And 
I mean , not only less successful . Although that &apos;s part of it , 
we &apos;re doing more in play worlds . 
I mean , good in terms of motivation to do something meaningful . Inspired in collaboration with each other . 
If we &apos;re in a game world , I think many of us are in our best version , at any time and immediately , ready to help , persistent . Solving the problem , trying to solve it as long as necessary , after failure . Try it again , 
and in reality . If we fail , if we encounter obstacles , we often feel different . 
We feel overwhelmed . We feel defeated . We feel threatened . Maybe depressed , frustrated . Or cynically , 
we never have those feelings . If we play games in games , they just don &apos;t exist . 
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m studying as a PhD student . 
Why is it in games ? It &apos;s impossible to think . You couldn &apos;t just achieve everything . 
How can we get these feelings out of play into reality ? 
So I looked at games like &quot; World of Warcraft , &quot; which is the ideal environment for solving problems in a community . 
And I noticed a few things : Epic victories in online worlds . 
So make it possible , first of all , when you step into one of these online games , especially at World of Warcraft . There are a lot of different characters ready to give you a world saving mission . And they do so immediately . 
But not just any mission , but a mission . They are perfect for your current level in the game . 
Right ? So they do . 
They never get a task . They can &apos;t solve it . 
But always on the edge of their abilities , so they have to make an effort . 
But there &apos;s no unemployment . In World of Warcraft , you &apos;re not sitting around . And you turn around , you have fools , you always have a targeted . You have something important to do . And 
there are , in a way , employees . 
Whatever they go , there are people who work . Hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to complete their epic mission . We have 
that in real life , not so easy . This feeling that , when you have a fingercut , people are willing to do it in ways . 
There &apos;s also this epic story . This inspiring story , why we &apos;re there and what we have to do . Then we get all this positive feedback . 
You &apos;ve certainly got from level up and level 1 strength . Or 1 intelligence . 
This constant feedback is not in real life . 
If I leave this stage , I don &apos;t have 1 speech . And 1 crazy idea . 20 crazy idea . 
I get in real life . 
So this feedback , not so . The problem of cooperation online worlds . Like World of Warcraft , it &apos;s so satisfying . Anytime on the brink of an epic victory , that we prefer to be in these game worlds all the time . 
They &apos;re just better than reality . 
To date , all World of Warcraft players have in common . 5.93 million years . So , we &apos;ve spent solving the virtual problems of Azeroth . 
It &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing . 
It may sound bad . But let &apos;s just look 
at it in context : 5.93 million years ago . Our first primate ancestors started walking upright 
, the first upright primacy . So OK , 
so when we talk about how much time we have to spend playing games right now . That &apos;s just meaning . When do you spend time with regard to the scale of human development ? When do you remember what &apos;s 
extraordinary ? But also appropriate . Because it turns out that by doing this whole time , we &apos;re using it all the time . In fact , changing what we as humans are able to do . 
We &apos;re becoming too cooperative . Thinking , heartfelt beings . 
That &apos;s the truth . That &apos;s what I believe . 
Take a look at these interesting statistics . The recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University . The average young person today in a country with a strong playing culture spends . 10,000 hours playing online until the age of 21 . 
So 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of two reasons . 
First of all , for kids in the United States , 10,080 hours is the exact total time they spend in school , from the fifth grade to the end of the high school . If you never miss it , 
so here we have a complete parallel education path where young people learn the same way . What it means to be a good player . Like anything else you do in school . And maybe 
some of you have the new book by Malcolm Gladwell . Overflying , so you know his theory of success . The theory of success of 10,000 hours . 
It &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science that if we spend 10,000 hours with laborious study of any subject , up to the age of 21 . We master it , 
we become so good at it , whatever we do . Like the most important people in the world . 
So what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are master players , and 
so the big question is , what exactly are players masterful ? Good . Because 
if we could figure out that out , we would have , kind of , unprecedented human potential at our disposal . 
So many people we have in the world right now . They have at least an hour a day playing online . 
These are our master players , 500 million people , who are exceptionally good at something . 
And over the next decade , we have another billion players . The exceptionally good at whatever . 
If you haven &apos;t heard it yet , 
the game industry has developed . Consoles that save energy and work on mobile networks , rather than broadband Internet , so that players around the world , especially in India , China , Brazil , can play online . 
You &apos;re expected to have an additional billion players . Over the next decade , 
we &apos;ve got a total of 1.5 billion players . 
So I started thinking about what it is . What these games are going to do to us . 
Here are the four things I found . First , urgency optimism , 
OK ? Imagine how extreme self @-@ motivation . 
Urgent optimism is desire to do something right away . Mastering a hurdle . Together with believing that we have a reasonable hope for success . 
Players always believe that an epical victory is possible . And that it &apos;s always worth it . Try trying , and that &apos;s the 
same : Players don &apos;t sit around . 
Players are champions in spiders . Poet social networks . 
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research . They show that we like people more after we played with them . Even if they beat us badly , 
the reason for that is that there &apos;s a lot of trust to have with someone a game to play . 
We trust that somebody will spend time with us , that the rules will be respected , that we have the same goal . And by the end of the game , so 
it allows for playing together . The growth of ties , trust and cooperation . 
As a result , we build stronger social relationships , happy 
productivity . Fantastic . 
You know , there &apos;s a reason . Why ? The average word of Warcraft player plays 22 hours a week , so to speak , as part @-@ time job , 
and the reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier . Working hard than when we relax , or nothing we do . 
We know that we as human beings function optimally . When we do hard , significant work , 
and players are always willing to work hard . When they get the right job and 
eventually epic meaning , 
they love players . It &apos;s part of awe . Adorable missions to become planetary dimensions . 
Here &apos;s a background information to get this right . You probably know all Wikipedia . The biggest Wiki in the world . The 
second largest Wiki in the world . With almost 80,000 entries , the World of Warcraft is . 
Wiki : Five million . People use it every month . 
They have more information about World of Warcraft . They &apos;ve collected it online than any other topic in any other Wiki . The world . 
They &apos;re creating an epic story . 
They &apos;re creating an epic source of knowledge about the World of Warcraft . 
OK . So these are four superpowers . They &apos;re leading to a single result : Players are super @-@ powerful , hopeful individuals . 
They &apos;re people who believe that they , as individuals , can change the world . 
And the only problem is they believe they can change the virtual worlds . But not the real ones . 
That &apos;s the problem . The one I &apos;m trying to solve , 
Edward Castronova , is a scientist . 
His work is awesome . 
He &apos;s studying why people have so much time , energy . And money in online worlds , 
and he says , &quot; We &apos;re witnessing nothing less than mass emigration into virtual worlds . &quot; And online gaming environments , 
and this by an economist , so he &apos;s logical . 
And he doesn &apos;t say the way I do . I develop games . I &apos;m a little exuberant . 
So he says , &quot; That actually makes sense . &quot; Because players can achieve more in online worlds than in real life . 
They can play games with stronger social ties . As in real life , they get more feedback . And rewards in games . As in real life , 
so he says , &quot; It &apos;s perfectly logical right now that players have more time in the virtual world than in real life . 
&quot; I agree with you first of all , that &apos;s logical . 
But it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation . 
We have to start to put the real world into a game . 
My inspiration comes from an event . It &apos;s 2,500 years back , 
there are these ancient cubes of sheep &apos;s cocks . You know , 
before these fantastic game econtrollers , there were sheep &apos;s cocks , 
and these were , so to speak , the first people to develop . Play equipment , and if you &apos;re working with the works of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus . You might know this story ? The story about how and why games were invented . 
According to Herodotus , games became more accurate craps in the kingdom of Lydia . During famine 
, there was supposedly such a great famine that the king of Lydia was so hungry that he turned into a crazy idea that 
people suffered , people fought . 
It was an extreme situation . It took an extreme solution . 
So they invented , according to Herodotus . The dice game and agreed a national strategy : In one day you would eat , the next day you would eat . You would play , 
and they would play so much deeper into the dice game . There are games so fascinating and we would be surrounded by satisfying , happy productivity that they would forget that there &apos;s nothing to eat . 
And then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat . 
And according to Herodotus , they survived for 18 years . This famine by living in one day and eating the next . 
And I think that &apos;s the same way we &apos;re playing games today . 
We &apos;re playing games to help alleviate the suffering of the real world . We &apos;re playing games to escape everything . That in the real world doesn &apos;t work . Everything that doesn &apos;t work satisfactorily in real life . And we &apos;re getting what we need from the games . 
But that doesn &apos;t have to be the end . 
That &apos;s the exciting thing . 
According to Herodotus , after 18 years of famine , it wasn &apos;t getting any better . So the king decided to start a final dice game . 
They divided the kingdom into two halves . 
They played a dice game . And the winners were allowed to break into an epic adventure , 
they left lydia and they went looking for a new home . They just left so many people behind . As food was there to survive . And they went to the rest of the place to thrive , where they could thrive . 
That sounds crazy , right ? 
But the latest DNA evidence shows that the Etruscans , who later formed the Roman Empire , The same DNA as the ancient Lydians , 
So scientists recently came to the conclusion that herodotus , crazy story , is actually true . 
And geologists found evidence of global cooling . The nearly 20 years took to explain the famine . 
So this crazy story could be true . Maybe 
they actually have their people saved by playing by 18 years of saving themselves in games , by playing . And then they had that inspiration , and so much learned about playing with each other that it would save the entire civilization . 
So we can . 
We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft since 1994 . 
This was the first real @-@ time strategy game . The World of Warcraft series . 
This was 16 years ago . 
They played craps for 18 years . We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft for 16 years . 
I &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game . 
So they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world . So I &apos;m taking my 21 billion hours of play a week . 
We should agree that half of us are one hour a day with games , right ? Until we solve the problems of the real 
world . I know you &apos;re going to ask , how do we solve problems ? The real world in games . And 
that &apos;s exactly the question I &apos;ve been asking about in recent years at the Institute for the Future . 
We &apos;ve got this banner in our office in Palo Alto . It expresses how we understand the future . 
We don &apos;t want to try to tell the future 
what we want before . Is the future to 
be created ? We want to imagine the best possible outcome . And then empower people to empower this idea to become reality . 
We face epic victories and give people the opportunity . To achieve them . 
I &apos;ll show you three games very briefly . The ones I designed to try and make people epic victories in their own future . 
This is a world without oil . 
The game is 2007 . 
It &apos;s an online game where you can overcome an oil shortage . 
Oil scarcity is invented . But we have enough online content with it . It becomes realistic for you , and you live your real life . In fact , without oil , so if you sign up to the game , tell us where you live . And then you get real @-@ time news movies . They show you how much oil costs , which is not there . How food supplies are affected , 
how transportation is affected . Whether schools are closed , whether there are riots . And you have to figure out how to shape your real life . If it were true , and we ask you to blog about it , to hire videos or photos . 
We have this 1,700 @-@ player game in 2007 . And we &apos;ve been testing it since then over the last three years . 
And I can tell you , it was a changing experience . 
Nobody wants to change their lives . Because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should . 
But if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and you &apos;re told , &quot; Get us going . &quot; The oil out 
, that &apos;s a fascinating adventure . You can find out how 
to go out there . If most of our players were to survive . The habits learned in the game would be maintained . 
So we opted for the next world saving game . A bigger , higher goal than just oil shortages . 
We have the Superstruct game at the Institute for the Future . 
The starting point is the computation of a supercomputer that people only have 23 years left on the planet . 
This supercomputer is called the Global Dismortality Sensitization System . Of course , 
the call to players to sign up . Do we have almost designed a Jerry Bruckheimer movie ? 
You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies , where there are the dream team . You have the astronaut , the scientist , the ex @-@ Sträfling , and only together can you save the world . 
But in our game , instead of just five people , we say , &quot; Everyone is on the dream team . &quot; And it &apos;s our job to build the future for energy , food , health , safety and the future of social justice . 
8,000 players played the game . For eight weeks . 
They found 500 incredible . Creative solutions that they can read . If you Google Superstruct and bring 
the last game , we will be out on March 3rd . It &apos;s a game in collaboration with the World Bank . 
If you complete the game , you get the World Bank Social Reformer Award 2010 . 
We work with universities across sub @-@ Saharan Africa . And invite you to learn how to redesign socially . 
We have a comic book on this . We have levels high for regional . Understanding knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and ingenuity . 
I want to invite you all . This game with young people to share . All over the world , especially in developing areas that benefit from this , together . Their own social ventures to imagine the world to save . 
Now I &apos;m going to finish . 
I want to ask you something : 
What do you think is happening ? Next , 
we have all these fantastic players . We have games that show us . What we can do , but we have the real world not yet saved . 
Well , I hope you agree with me that players are human resources . We are working in real life , in real life . And that games are a big part of change . 
We have all these superpowers , happy productivity . The ability to build tight social networks , urgency optimism and the desire for epiepical meaning . 
I really hope that together we play important games to play on this planet for another century to survive . 
And I hope you will play with me . And play 
when I look forward to the next decade . I &apos;m sure about two things : That we &apos;re able to create any imaginable future . And that we &apos;re able to play all kinds of games . So I &apos;m saying , let &apos;s play the world @-@ changing games . Let &apos;s start . 
Thank you . 
For some time now , I &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect . It may seem strange that a magician is interested in this . Unless you look at it like me , it &apos;s a deception . Those become something real when someone is just stuck enough to believe in it , 
in other words , have sugar pills . In some studies , a measurable effect has been the placebo effect , and that &apos;s just because of it . Because the person thinks what happens to her is . A pharmaceutical or some kind of pain management , for example , if the patient is only firm enough to believe in it , there &apos;s measurable action in the body that &apos;s called the placebo effect . 
A deception becomes something real because somebody like this perceives it so 
that we can understand each other . Now I &apos;m going to show you a basic , very simple magic trick . 
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . This is a trick that has been in every magic book for kids since at least the 1950s . 
I myself have taken it from the Cub Scout Magic . The scout scout in the 1970s , 
I &apos;m going to do it for you . And then explain it , 
and then I &apos;m going to explain why I explain it . 
So you see what happens . 
The knife . You can study that . My hand you can study . 
I &apos;m just going to put the knife in my fist . 
I &apos;m pushing my sleeves back 
and to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeves or comes out of it . I &apos;m just going to push my wrist right here , 
so you can see that there &apos;s never anything moving at all . As long as I &apos;m pressurizing here , nothing can go in my sleeves or come out . 
And the goal is very simple . 
I &apos;m going to open my hand . And hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife will go through my bare physical magnetism . 
It &apos;s actually so firmly in its place that I can shake it . Without the knife falling down , nothing moves 
into my sleeve or comes out . No trickery . And you can study everything . 
TA @-@ DA : 
Now , this is a trick that I often teach small kids . Which are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception . If you look more closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick to do . 
I think many of you in this room probably know . This trick , 
it works . Here &apos;s how 
I hold the knife in my hand . 
I say I close my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or comes out , and that &apos;s a lie . 
The reason I &apos;m putting my wrist on hold is because of this . The fact that it contains the real secret of illusion . 
The moment I do my hand from you , that you turn it away from behind , that you see it , that finger moves . Here , my index finger , just from where it was . In a position where it &apos;s so stretched 
out , great 
trick . There &apos;s somebody sitting behind there who had no 
childhood , so he &apos;s here . Right ? 
And when I turn around , the finger changes its position , 
and now you could talk about it . Why ? One deception is why you don &apos;t realize that down here , only three fingers are visible , because the mind and the way in which it &apos;s processing information . It doesn &apos;t count individually . One , two , three , but it sees it as a group . 
But that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about . Now , actually , not at all . And then open . I mean , hand . 
Of course , it &apos;s held there . But not by the magnetism of my body , but by a trick , by my index finger , which is there now . 
And if I close my hand , the same thing happens by turning back . It &apos;s hidden by this movement that the finger moves back . 
I take this hand away , and here &apos;s the knife . 
You can do this trick to show your friends and neighbors . Thank you . 
Now , what about the placebo effect ? A year ago or so , 
I read a study that really bypassed me . 
I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that &apos;s why it was for me . It was an amazing thing . Because what 
it was like is this . It turned out , if you had a placebo in the form of a white pill , you would have a place . It turned out , in the form of an aspirin tablet , it &apos;s simple . A round white pill that has a certain measurable effect . 
But if you take the shape in which you give placebo , for example , into a smaller pill . And you color this blue and you embosse a letter on it , it &apos;s actually measurably more effective . 
And that , though none of them are any pharmaceutical ones , they &apos;re just sugar pills . 
But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill . 
What this really made me flick out of . 
But it turned out that &apos;s not all that . 
If you take capsules , they &apos;re even more effective than tablets . Any shape , 
a colored capsule , yellow at one end . And red at the other end is better than a white capsule . 
Dosage also plays a role . 
A pill twice a day is not as good as three pills . I can &apos;t get to the exact statistics now . Remember , I &apos;m sorry . 
The key thing . But 
is that dosage also plays a role . 
And the shape plays a role . 
And if you have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to grab the needle . 
Right ? An injection with an ineffective one . A few milliliters of an ineffective substance that you inject into a patient . 
This creates a very strong image . In the head , this is much stronger than a white pill . 
This graph is really . I &apos;m going to show you another time . If we have a projector , 
the fact is that the white pill isn &apos;t as good as the blue pill . It doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule . It doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle . 
And none of this has any really pharmaceutical property . It &apos;s just our belief in it , which has a stronger effect in us . 
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a magic trick . 
I take something that is obviously a deception . And let it look real . 
We know from that study that you go to the needle . If you want to get to the point , 
this is an 18 @-@ inch @-@ long needle . It &apos;s very , very sharp . And I &apos;m going to sterilize it a little bit first . 
This is really my flesh . It &apos;s not Damian &apos;s special farmed meat . 
This is my skin . This is not a special effect . Hollywood : 
I &apos;m going to put this needle in my skin . And through it , I &apos;m going to push it up , and it &apos;s going to get out on the other side . 
If you &apos;re going to get sick , if you &apos;re going to be fainting . I have a couple of friends . Last night , I showed it in the hotel room . And some people I didn &apos;t know . And there &apos;s a woman who &apos;s almost fainthead . 
So I propose , if you &apos;re going to get bad at you quickly , look for the next 30 seconds away , or you know what ? I &apos;m going to get the first delicate part . Here in 
the back , you can see it in a moment . But you can also look away if you want . So it 
&apos;s going to be so accurate . Here &apos;s where my meat starts . At the bottom of my arm , I &apos;m just going to make a little bit of a break . 
I &apos;m really sorry . Is it going to do that ? 
Crazy . And now . Just a little bit . Through my skin and on the other side , out again . 
Now we &apos;re actually in the same situation . We had the knife trick , 
about , 
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers . Or ... So I 
&apos;m going to show you . This is one , two , three , four , five . 
Well , 
I know what people think . If you see that , 
you say , &quot; Okay . &quot; This is certainly not so stupid . And it &apos;s just stifling your skin around us for a few minutes to talk about . 
Well , then I &apos;ll show you . 
What does that look like ? Well , it looks pretty good . 
Yes . I know . And people in the back say , &quot; Okay . &quot; I didn &apos;t really see that . People 
in the adjoining rooms are now coming in . 
Let me tell you . Close up , this is 
really my skin . This is not a special effect . 
Hollywood . This is my flesh . And I can turn this around . 
I &apos;m sorry if you get bad . Look away . Don &apos;t look there . 
People in the back , or those who later . Sometime , once they see it on video , they say , &quot; Well , yeah , that looks pretty good . &quot; Impressive . But if it were real , he would see . She &apos;s a hole here . And there , if it was really real , it would bleed . Okay . 
Let me just add a little blood to you . 
Yeah , here it is . 
Normally , I would take out the needle now . 
I would clean my arm . And show you that there are no wounds there . 
But I think in this frame here and with the intention of delusion , something real , real . Will I just take the needle ? Let it in there . And so , from the stage , 
we &apos;ll go in the next few days a few more times . 
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . Thank you very much . 
So I &apos;ve had a lot of fish in my life . 
I just loved two . 
This first one was more like a passionate affair . 
It was a nice fish , tasty , good consistency , rich . A bestseller on the menu . 
What a fish . 
Even better . It became aquaculture after the supposedly highest standards of sustainability . 
So you could feel comfortable growing it for sale . 
I had a relationship with this beauty for several months . 
One day , the company &apos;s boss called and asked if I was growing up at an event . The sustainability of the farm . 
Of course , I said , 
&quot; Here was a company . It was trying to solve what this unimaginable problem was . It &apos;s become for our chefs , how do we keep fish on our menus over 
the last 50 years ? We &apos;ve fished the seas , how we &apos;ve beaten forests bare . 
It &apos;s hard to overstate destruction . 
90 percent of the big fish we love , the tuna , the curative butte , the salmon , the swordfish . They &apos;ve collapsed . 
It &apos;s almost nothing left . 
So , aquaculture is probably going to become , or bad aquaculture , fishing . Part of our future . 
Many arguments against it , fishing facilities pollute the environment , most of them anyway . And they &apos;re inefficient . Let &apos;s take tuna , a big disadvantage . 
It &apos;s got 15 percent feed recovery . 
That &apos;s 15 pounds of wild fish are needed . So you get one pound of farmed tuna , 
not very sustainable tastes . 
Not very good either . 
So here was finally a company trying to get it right . 
I wanted to support it . 
The day before the event , I called the public relations chief for the company . 
We call him Don Don 
, I just said the facts . Right ? You &apos;re famous for that . So far out in the sea , you don &apos;t pollute the environment 
. That &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; We &apos;re so far out that the waste is distributed by our fish . &quot; Not concentrated . And 
then he added . &quot; We &apos;re essentially a world of our own . 
This 2.5 percent feed recovery to one , &quot; he said , 
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot; 
2.5 percent to . One , great , 
2.5 percent to . One , what feeds ? Your 
sustainable proteins , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Great , &quot; I said , &quot; I put up , 
and that evening I lay in bed . &quot; And I thought , &quot; What the hell is a sustainable protein ? 
&quot; So the next day , I called . Shortly before the Don event . 
I said , &quot; Don , what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot; 
He said , &quot; He doesn &apos;t know . &quot; He &apos;s going to ask . 
Well , I telephoned a few people in the company . Nobody could give me a good answer . Until I finally got on the phone with the leading biologist , 
we call him Don Don . 
&quot; I said , &quot; What , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot; 
Well , he mentioned some algae and some fishmeal , and then he said , &quot; Chicken pellets . &quot; 
I said , &quot; Chicken pellets . &quot; 
He said , &quot; Yes . &quot; Feathers , skin , bone meal . Remnants dried . And processed into food . 
I said , &quot; How much percent of your food is chicken ? &quot; 
Assuming maybe two percent ? 
Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , he said . 
I said , &quot; Don . &quot; &quot; What &apos;s sustainable about this ? &quot; &quot; Feeding chicken to fish ? &quot; 
There was a long break in the pipeline , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot; 
I fell in love with this fish . 
No . Not because I &apos;m a self @-@ righteous connoisseur . And I &apos;m a good man . 
That &apos;s me . 
No . I &apos;m not really in love with this fish because I swear to God , the fish after this conversation , tasted chicken . 
This second fish , that &apos;s another kind of love story . 
It &apos;s the romantic species , the way you ever better do it . You get to know your fish , the more you love the fish . 
I first put it in a restaurant in southern Spain . 
A friend journalist had long been talking about this fish . 
She kind of cuffed us . 
He came on the table with a bright , almost shimmering white color . 
The cook had cooked it . 
Hold twice . 
Amazingly , he was still delicious . 
Who can make a fish ? So good . Taste . Let it be after it &apos;s cooked . 
I can &apos;t . But this guy can call it . 
We call it Miguel . In fact , he &apos;s called Miguel . 
And no . He doesn &apos;t cook the fish . And he &apos;s not a chef . At least in the way you and I understand it . 
He &apos;s a biologist at Veta La Palma . 
This is a fish rearing in the southwest corner . Spain , 
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river . Guadalquivir , 
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of Argentines . 
They grew meat cattle on what basically were wetlands . 
They did this by draining the land . 
They built this complicated sequence of canals . And they pushed water out of the country . And out into the river . 
Well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not economically . 
And environmentally , it was a disaster . 
It brought about 90 percent of the birds around , which is a lot of birds for this place . 
And so in 1982 , a Spanish company with environmental awareness . It bought the land . 
What did they do ? 
They bought the river of water in reverse . 
They literally put the lever around . 
Instead of pushing out the water , they used the channels to do it . Put the water back in . 
They flooded the channels . 
They created an 11,000 hectares of fish rearing : Perch , sea ash , shrimp , eel . And so Miguel and his company have the complete reverse of ecological destruction . 
The farm is incredible . 
I mean , they &apos;ve never seen anything like this before . 
They &apos;re staring out onto the horizon , a million miles away . And everything you see is flooded canals . And this dense , lush march -- 
I wasn &apos;t there long ago with Miguel . 
He &apos;s an incredible guy . Three parts : Charles Darwin . And one part : A crocodile for kissing . 
Okay . There we were . And we fought through . The wetlands and I chastise . And sweat has mud up to my knees . And Miguel keeps calm . A biology lecture . 
Here he lifts a rare track . Now mentioned . 
He mentions the mineral needs of phytoplankton , 
and here he sees a pattern of bundles . That &apos;s what he calls the Tanzanian giraffe . 
It turns out Miguel has the biggest part of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa , and he &apos;s been doing this . 
I asked him how he could become a fish expert . 
He said , &quot; Fish , I don &apos;t know about fish . 
I &apos;m an expert in relationships . And 
then he goes . &quot; And he falls into more talk of rare birds and algae . And strange aquatic plants , 
and don &apos;t get me wrong . That was really fascinating . You know , the biotic community , unplugged . So , in the way 
it &apos;s great . But I was in love . 
And my head got weak over this cooked piece of delicious fish . The one I had on the eve , 
so I interrupted it . I said , Miguel . How is it that your fish tastes so good ? He 
pointed to algae . 
I know boy , the algae of phytoplankton , the relationships . That &apos;s incredible . 
But what do your fish eat ? 
How is the recycling of feed ? Well 
, he goes on . I tell you that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eat what they eat in the wild , what they would eat . 
The plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton -- that &apos;s what the fish feed . 
The system is so healthy . It &apos;s completely self @-@ explanatory . 
There &apos;s no food . There &apos;s no feed 
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals . 
Later that day , I drove on this plot with Miguel . And I asked him , &quot; I said , for a place that seems so natural , unlike any farm on the farm I &apos;ve ever been . How do you measure success ? &quot; 
The moment it was like a film director was demanding a stage change . 
And we were bowing around the corner . And we had the most incredible sight . Thousands and thousands of pinkers , flamingos , literally pinker carpet . As far as the eye can see . 
That &apos;s success . He said , 
&quot; Look at their bellies . &quot; Pink , 
they &apos;re slugging . Sludge 
. I was completely confused . 
I said , Miguel . Don &apos;t sludge your fish . Yes 
. He said , &quot; We &apos;re losing 
20 percent of our fish . And fish eggs to birds . 
&quot; Now , last year , 600,000 people were on this plot . More than 250 different species . 
It &apos;s the largest one today . And one of the most important private bird reserves in Europe . 
I said , &quot; Miguel is a good thing . Fourishing bird population , not . The last one . &quot; You can have this on a fish farm . He 
shook his head . No . 
He said , &quot; We &apos;re building extensively , not intensively . 
This is an ecological network . 
The flamingos eat the shrimps . 
The shrimps eat the phytoplankton . 
So the closer the belly , the better . &quot; 
The system , okay ? Let &apos;s think about that . A farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals . And a farm that can succeed in the health of its predators . 
A fish rearing . But also a bird reserve . 
Oh . And by the way , these flamingos shouldn &apos;t even be there from the outset . 
They breed 240 kilometers away in a city where soil quality is better . For nest maintenance 
every morning , they fly 240 kilometers to the farm . 
And every night , they fly 240 kilometers . Back . 
They do that . Because they &apos;re on the white line that &apos;s yesterday , the A92 highway . 
Seriously . 
I had a kind of trip that penguins had imagined . So I looked at Miguel . 
I said , Miguel , fly 240 kilometers . The farm , and then fly them . 240 kilometers back . In the 
evening , they do that for the kids . He 
looked at me as if I had just heard a song by Whitney Houston . 
He said , &quot; No , you do that because the food is better . &quot; 
I don &apos;t have the skin of my beloved fish mentioned . It was delicious , and I don &apos;t like the skin of fish . I don &apos;t like it . I don &apos;t like it sucks . 
It &apos;s crunchy . It &apos;s this biting , charred taste . 
I almost never cook with it . And 
yet , when I put it in this restaurant in southern Spain , it didn &apos;t have any taste of fish skin at all . 
It tasted sweet . And it tasted pure as if you take a bite from the ocean . 
I mentioned that to Miguel . And he nodded . 
He said , &quot; The skin looks like a sponge . 
&quot; It &apos;s the last defense . Before anything enters the body , 
it has evolved over the course of evolution to suck up impurities , 
and then he added , &quot; But our water has no impurities . Okay 
. A farm . &quot; They don &apos;t feed their fish . A farm . They measure their success in the success of their predators , 
and then I realized . When he says , &quot; A farm that doesn &apos;t have impurities , it undermines enormously . &quot; Because the water that flows through this farm comes from the river Guadalquivir . 
It &apos;s a river that connects all these things . The rivers that are now prone to it are leading with them . Chemical pollutants , outflow of pesticides , 
and if it fights through the system , and it leaves , the water is cleaner than it came in , and it &apos;s cleaner than it has come in . 
The system is so healthy . It cleans the water . 
So not only a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals . Not only a farm that can succeed in the health of its predators , but a farm that literally has a water treatment plant . And not only for these fish , but also for you . And me , 
because when the water flows out , it sinks into the Atlantic , 
a drop in the ocean . I know , but I take it , and you should . Because this love story , however romantic , is also instructive . 
You might say that it &apos;s a recipe . For the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about meat or perch . 
What we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , of one where food is . In fact , taste good . 
But for many people , that &apos;s a little too radical . 
We &apos;re not realists . We enjoy . We &apos;re lovers . 
We love weekly markets . We love small family farms . We talk about regional food . We eat organic food , 
and if you say that &apos;s the things that are the future of good food insurance . Someone somewhere up and says , &quot; Hey guys , I love pink . &quot; Flamingos : But how are you going to feed the world ? How 
are you going to feed the world ? 
May I be honest . 
I don &apos;t like this question . 
No . Not because we &apos;re already producing enough calories to feed the world more than just feed . 
A billion people are going to starve today . 
A billion . That &apos;s more than ever because of stark inequalities in distribution , not total production . 
Now , I don &apos;t like this question because it &apos;s the logic of our food system that has been going on for the last 50 years . 
Feed grain to vegetable eaters . Pesticides to monocultures , chemicals . The Earth hens at fish and all the time the agricultural industry has just asked . If we feed more people cheaper , how horrible can that be ? That 
was the reason . It was the justification . It was the business plan of American agriculture . 
We should call it . What it is is a liquidation business . A business that quickly takes up ecological capital . That is exactly what enables that production . 
That &apos;s not a business . And it &apos;s not agriculture . 
Our grain chamber is threatened today . Not because of decreasing supply , but because of decreasing resources , 
not the latest Moravian lawners . And tractor inventions , but through fertile land , not by pumps , but by fresh water . Not by chainsaws , but by forests . And not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea . They 
want to feed the world . 
Let &apos;s start with the question : How are we going to feed ourselves ? 
Or better . How can we create conditions ? Which each community can feed itself to feed that 
to do . Don &apos;t look at the agricultural industrial model for the future . 
It &apos;s really old . And it &apos;s done : Capital , chemistry . 
And machines are on top of it , and it never has anything really good . It &apos;s produced for food , and 
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model . 
That &apos;s the one that has two billion years of work experience . 
Look at Miguel . Farmers like Miguel , 
farms . The worlds are not for themselves , farms that restore . Instead of using up farms that grow extensively , instead of just intensive farmers who are not just producers , but experts in relationships . 
Because they are the ones who are experts on taste . 
And if I &apos;m really honest , they &apos;re a better cook than I ever will be . 
You know , I &apos;m right . Because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious . 
Thank you . 
I grew up with a lot of science fiction 
in my school days . I went to school by bus every day . One hour per way . And my 
nose was always in a book , a science fiction book . That &apos;s what kidnapped my thoughts into other worlds . And in a narrative way , my deep @-@ seated insatiable curiosity was satisfied . 
This curiosity was also shown in the fact that whenever I wasn &apos;t in school , I was always strolling through the woods . And rehearsals were collecting frogs . And snakes . And beetle And pond water brought everything home . And under the microscope , 
I looked at , I was totally science @-@ excited . 
You know , it was always about trying to make sense of the world . And the limits of what is possible , 
and my love of science fiction seemed to be reflected in my environment . Because back in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon . And we explored the deep sea . 
Jacques Cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows that were giving us animals . And places and a world of wonders that we showed ourselves before , we could never have imagined . 
So that &apos;s probably very good at the science fiction role . 
And I was an artist . 
I could draw . I could paint , 
and because it &apos;s neither video games nor this saturation with computer @-@ generated movies , nor the whole visual language . In the media landscape , I had to give the images in my head . 
We all had to do that at the time . If we as children read a book , we took the author &apos;s description and projected it . And they would be on the screen in our heads . 
My reaction to that was drawing and painting aliens . Aliens worlds , robots , spacecraft and so on . What in math class 
I was constantly caught by the teacher . How I was hiding behind the textbook , 
painting around , creativity just had to get out of it somehow . 
And something interesting happened . Because what happened to me about Jacques Cousteaus &apos; shows was the idea of a world that we knew completely unseen . Here on our planet . 
Even surely I would never have an alien world with a spaceship . That seemed pretty unlikely to me . 
But here was a world that I could actually enter . Here on Earth . And it was just as fascinating . And exotic as all of that . What I &apos;d always imagined when I was reading these books . 
So when I was 15 , I decided to become a diver . 
The only problem with this was that I was in a small village in Canada , 1,000 kilometers from the next ocean . 
I left myself with this . But I didn &apos;t discourage . 
I annoyed my father until he finally had a diving school in Buffalo , New York . Right on the other side of the border where we lived . 
I made my diving certificate in a pool of YMCA in the middle of winter in Buffalo , New York . 
The ocean . But a real ocean I got only two years later . When we moved to California , 
since then , in the 40 years that have passed , I &apos;ve been under 3,000 hours underwater . 500 hours of that in submersible boats , 
and I &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea itself is in the flatter oceans . So rich in fascinating life as we are in really hard to imagine . 
Nature &apos;s imagination knows no boundaries , unlike nature &apos;s own , miserable human imagination . 
To this day , I find deep awe for what I have to do on my dives . 
And my love of the ocean continues at the same intensity . As ever . 
And ever as I grew up as an adult , it was that filmmaking . 
That seemed the best way to make my inner urge to tell stories . With my need to create images , 
to unite when I was a kid , I drew . I kept drawing comic books , and so films were 
the way . To bring images and stories together , that fit . Together . 
Of course , the stories I chose were from the science fiction field , Terminator Aliens . And Abyss : At 
Abyss , I could have my preference for the underwater world and diving combined with filmmaking . 
So my two passions sort of intertwined . 
Something interesting happened at Abyss to create a narrative problem in this movie . And that was , we had to create a kind of liquid water system , grab . We were going to go back to computer @-@ generated animation CG . 
And what came out of this was the first computer @-@ generated soft surface figure . The one ever seen in a movie was 
the film , which didn &apos;t bring any money , which was actually playing . He just started to pay his production costs . But I noticed something fascinating . The audience around the world was hypnotized . The magic that 
was thought to have been , according to Arthur Clarke &apos;s law , advanced technology and magic are , as you know , no longer to be distinguished from each other . So 
they saw something magical . 
And I found that incredibly exciting . 
And I thought , &quot; Wow , that absolutely must be involved in film art . &quot; 
So we went to Terminator 2 , my next movie . A lot further along 
with ILM , we created . We created there the guy of liquid metal , who was successful . That was quite a thing . How this effect would arrive ? 
And it worked . Again , we had created something magical . And the effect in the audience was the same . But we did have a little bit more money in the movie 
, from these two experiences . And starting with this , we had a whole new world . A whole new world of creativity for filmmakers . 
So I started a company with my good friend Stan . Winston , who was the best make @-@ up and creature designer at that time , called Digital Domain . 
The basic idea of this company was to start the phase of analog processes with optical printers , etc . , and to start digital productions in a moment . 
And we did . And we did , too , for a time , 
get a competitive advantage . But in the mid @-@ 1990s , we realized that we were in the Creature and Character Design , which we actually founded the company for . I was too slow to move forward . 
I wrote this piece of Avatar . This is the benchmark for visual effects . And computer @-@ generated effects were supposed to shift to new heights with realistic human expressive characters . These were made using CG and the main characters were supposed to be all CG . And the world was supposed to be CG . 
But the benchmark pretty much pushed back . And the people in my company told me that for the time being , we were not yet able to do that . So that shifted . 
I did that , and made this other movie about the big ship . 
That goes down to the studio , I have that as Romeo and Juliet sold it on a ship . It became a epic @-@ scale love film , a passionate movie , secret 
. But did I actually want to be a real wreck ? Dive down the Titanic 
, that &apos;s why I made the film . 
That &apos;s the truth . The studio knew that . But not me , 
I have it . But convinced by saying , &quot; We dive to the wreck . &quot; We film the real wreck . 
We will do it in the opening sequence of the film . 
That &apos;s incredibly important . It &apos;s a good marketing tag . And 
I persuaded you to fund an expedition . 
Sounds crazy . But that &apos;s okay again . It &apos;s because your imagination creates a reality . 
We actually created a reality six months later , where I got to a Russian dive boat , and I found myself . Four kilometers below the surface of the North Atlantic , and I got the real Titanic through a bullet . This was 
not a movie . No HD . This was real . 
So this really bypassed me . 
And the preparations for this were enormous . We had to have cameras and headlights and everything . 
And I noticed how much these deep @-@ sea dive gears resembled a space mission . 
Well , they were also high @-@ tech . And they needed extensive planning . 
You go into this capsule . Then you float into this dark , hostile environment where there &apos;s no hope of salvation . If you don &apos;t make it back yourself , 
and I thought , wow , that &apos;s the same as if I were in a science fiction movie . 
That &apos;s really cool . I 
was really obsessed with exploring the deep sea . Anyway , from the part that &apos;s 
got to do with curiosity and science . It was all . It was adventure . It was curiosity . It was imagination . 
And it was an experience that Hollywood didn &apos;t give me . 
Because , you know , I could imagine a creature for which we would then create a visual effect . But I couldn &apos;t imagine what I could imagine outside the window , 
right ? Some of the expeditions that followed , I saw beings in thermal springs . And sometimes things I &apos;ve never seen before . Sometimes things that nobody has ever seen before . And for those who science was at the time we saw them . Not a word 
at all , that &apos;s what really turned me around . And I wanted more , 
and so I met a slightly unusual decision . 
After the success of Titanic , I said , &quot; Okay . I want to be my main profession as a filmmaker . &quot; Hollywood is on ice and I &apos;m going to be a full @-@ time researcher for a while . And 
then we started planning these expeditions . 
We went to Bismarck . And we explored them with robotic vehicles . 
We went back to the wreck . 
The Titanic . We took small robots that we had built . They were carrying out a fiberglass cable , 
and our intention was to dive in . And the inside of the ship , looking at what had never been done before . 
Nobody had ever had ever explored the inside of the wreck . You had no means to do that . So we developed the technology we needed . 
NA : And I &apos;m now sitting on the deck . The Titanic . In a submersible boat , and I see planks that are quite similar to these boards here . And of those I know once the band was playing there . 
And I &apos;m flying through the band with a little robot vehicle . 
I &apos;m actually only operating it , but my consciousness is inside the vehicle . 
It felt like I was physically inside the ship wreck of the Titanic . 
That was the surreal form of a déjà vu . I &apos;ve ever experienced that , because before I was bogging around a corner , I always knew . What &apos;s going to appear in the light cone of the vehicle , because I had walked over the movie set for months . When we shot the film , 
the set was actually an exact copy of the ship &apos;s blueprints . 
So that was a very strange experience . 
She made me realize this telepresence experience that you use robotic avatars like this . And so , your awareness into the vehicle , into this different shape . You can move the existence . 
It was really incredibly profound . 
And maybe a little bit of a view of it . What might be happening in a few decades . If you have cyborg bodies to explore something or other things to do . In all sorts of post @-@ human future scenarios that I can imagine as a science fiction fan . 
After these expeditions , we started what we saw down there . Really ? Learning to appreciate . For example , these deep sea equals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . These are , like , aliens . But here on Earth . 
They live with chemosynthesis . 
They don &apos;t exist in a sunlight @-@ based system . How do we do that 
? And so you see animals right next to a 500 degrees centigrade . Hot water cloud lives . And 
you can &apos;t imagine they live there . 
At the same time , I was also very interested in space science . This was again the science fiction influence from my childhood . 
And so I ended up with the people who were interested in space . And those with NASA have to do with NASA , and they sit on NASA &apos;s expert board and plan real space missions . They go through Russia . Before the mission , the biomedical protocol , and all the drum and drum flying . Then to the International Space Station , and they take our 3D camera systems . 
That was fascinating . 
But in the end , it was because I was a space scientist with us going into the deep sea . I took them 
and I gave them access to the world . Down there , astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme situations . I took them to the sources so they could look around , take samples and test instruments . And so on . 
We did documentary films , but we actually did science . More specifically , space science , 
so the circle between my existence as a science fiction fan closed . Back then , when I was a kid , and I was a reality . 
And as I went on this journey of discovery , I learned a lot . 
I learned a lot about science . But I also learned a lot about leadership . 
Now , you probably think a director must be able to lead . Being a guide , like a ship captain , or something like that . But 
I didn &apos;t understand much about leadership . Before I started these expeditions , 
because at a certain point , I had to tell myself , &quot; What am I doing ? &quot; Actually , here . 
Why am I doing this ? What &apos;s coming out of this ? These 
stupid movies don &apos;t bring us money . One : We &apos;re 
just playing production costs . One of fame , no trace . 
Everybody thinks I &apos;m between Titanic and Avatar . I &apos;d run away and somewhere on a towel on the beach . 
I &apos;ve got all these movies . These documentary films for a very small audience . 
No fame , no honor . No money . What are you doing ? 
You &apos;re doing it for the sake of the task , for the sake of the challenge . And the ocean is the most challenging environment that exists . You &apos;re doing it for the discovery noise . Because of and because of the strange connection that emerges when a small group of people form a team . 
Because we have all of this at just 10 to 12 people . We &apos;ve worked together for years , and sometimes we &apos;ve been on sea for two to three months in a row . 
And in this community , you can see that the most important thing is respect that you have in front of each other . Because you &apos;ve done a job . You don &apos;t know how to explain that to anyone else 
when you go back to land . And you say , &quot; We had to do it . &quot; The fiberglass , the sound attenuation . And all around . The whole technique . And the difficulties . The human power . When you work at sea , you can just not explain to the other . This is like policemen or soldiers who do something in common . And you know they never can explain it to anyone . 
There &apos;s a connection . There &apos;s mutual respect , 
so when I came back to my next movie , Avatar , I tried to apply the same leadership style , which is that you respect your team . And in return , that respect deserves to be respected , 
and that really changed the dynamics . 
So I stood there again with a little team on unknown terrain . We turned Avatar with a new technology that it didn &apos;t exist before . 
Hugely exciting , 
a tremendous challenge . 
And we got a four and a half years to become a real family . 
And that changed my way of making films . 
Completely , there were people who thought we had these ocean properties really done well , and we were transporting them to Pandora . And 
for me , it was more of a principled way of doing my job . The actual process that changed as a result : What 
can we do from all of this 
, what lessons do we have ? 
We learned . I think the first thing is curiosity . 
It &apos;s the most powerful human property . Our 
imagination is a force that even creates a reality . 
And respect for your team is more important than all laurels . This world comes 
to me with young filmmakers . They say , &quot; Give me a advice like me . &quot; This is how to do this . And 
I say , &quot; Don &apos;t limit yourself . 
&quot; One : Get this . Others for you . Don &apos;t do it for you . Don &apos;t bet against yourself , but take risks , take risks , you 
NASA has . This favorite sentence : Failure is not an alternative . But 
in art and in exploration , failure has to be an alternative . Because there it guarantees a benefit of trust . 
No important undertaking . Innovation has ever been approached without risk . 
You have to be ready . Such risks have 
to be taken . That &apos;s the idea I &apos;d like to share with you . Failure is an alternative . Fear . But is not a thank you . 
If I can bring you one thing closer today , it &apos;s that the whole data we consume is larger than the data we consume , the sum of their parts . And instead of thinking about overloading information , I want you to think about how we are information . So that we can use patterns to emerge . And we see trends that otherwise are not visible . 
So what we see here is a typical death chart , arranged by age . 
The program I &apos;m using here is a little experiment . 
It &apos;s called Pivot . And what I can do with Pivot is that I &apos;m going to filter for a certain cause of death . Let &apos;s say accidents . 
And immediately I see another pattern . 
This is because , in the middle , here , people are most active . And you &apos;re most frail over here . 
We can go one step further and sort it out . Then the data is new , and we see that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects . But not for everybody . Now , 
if we go further and sort by age , we say , 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are even the main cause that people worry about , and we think that &apos;s the reason why we think about them . 
And if you look at things , you see that &apos;s particularly true for men . 
So you realize that the image of information and data in this way is very much swimming . In a vivid information graph , 
and if we do this for raw data , why not for content ? 
Even what we have here are the front images . Every single Sports Illustrated that has ever been printed . 
It &apos;s all here . It &apos;s all online . 
You can like it after I gave my talk in your rooms . 
With Pivot , you can dive into a decade . 
You can dive into a given year . 
You can dive directly to a particular issue . 
Now , if I look here , I see the athletes who are out in this issue . And the sports , 
I &apos;m a Lance Armstrong fan . So I click here . What makes all the issues that Lance Armstrong mentions to me ? Now 
, if I get just a bigger overview , I could think . OK . What if I could get all about cycling ? So 
I take a step back . And I expand the perspective . 
Now I see Greg Lemon , 
and so you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , more specifically , more broadly , zoom in , zoom out , you don &apos;t look for it or surf . Not easy . Just 
you do something . It &apos;s actually a little different . 
It &apos;s something in between . And we think it changes the way in which information is used to do it . 
I want to take this idea a little bit further . So , with about what &apos;s a little crazy , 
what we &apos;ve done here is we have taken every single wikipedia page . And you can just just just take a little summary . 
The summary contains a quick overview . And a symbol of the area from which it comes , 
I &apos;ll just show you the top 500 of the most popular wikipedia pages . 
But even in this narrow view , we can do a lot of things . 
We get an instant impression of the issues . The ones that are most popular on Wikipedia , 
I &apos;m going to vote on the issue of government . 
Now , after I &apos;ve elected government , I realize that the categories of Wikipedia that are most covered by it -- Time Magazines , people of the year . 
This is really important . Because this is a realization that is not in a single Wikipedia page . 
This is only to be seen . If you go back a step and look at the whole thing , 
looking at one of these summaries . I can then go into the subject of Time Magazines , People of the Year . Go and everybody together . 
See , if I look at all these people , I realize that the majority of them are government officials . Some of them come from science . Some of them come from economics , even less . Here &apos;s my boss . And one comes from music . 
And interestingly , Bono is also a TED Prize winner . 
So we can jump now . And take a look at all the TED Prize winners , 
you see , we surf the web . The first time it &apos;s really like it &apos;s a web , not just from side to side , but much more abstract . 
And so I want to show you something else . What a little surprise . Could 
I just show you the New York Times website ? 
Pivot , this application . I don &apos;t want to call it a browser . It &apos;s really not a browser . But you can look at websites with it . And we bring this zoom technology . Every single website . Like this . 
So I can take a step back . And right to a specific section . 
So that &apos;s important because you can only go through looking at websites of this kind in a way that allows you to get the whole Internet progression in the same way . 
So I can zoom in into my course , in a certain time frame . So 
here &apos;s the state of the whole demonstration . I &apos;ve kept it up to this point , 
and I can sort of see everything I &apos;ve seen so far . I can get 
back again , and if I go out and look at everything , I can rearrange my course . Maybe after my search past . Here I &apos;ve been looking for nepotistic . Here &apos;s Bing , or Here &apos;s live Labs Pivot . 
And from here , I can go into the page . And call it again . 
It &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again . And every time it does the overall picture . Larger than the sum of the data pieces in the world 
right now . Let &apos;s think that data is a curse . 
We talk about the curse of the abundance of information . 
We talk about drowning in information . 
What if we could turn this situation around ? And the Internet upside down . So instead of always being from one to the other , we &apos;re going to be like this . Start from many things . Many things . Can go . And by doing this , we can see patterns that would otherwise have been hidden . 
If we can do this , then this data trap will be . Maybe a new source of meaningful information . 
And instead of just getting in information , we can know from it . 
And if we know , then maybe we can even learn wisdom from it . 
So I stop . Thank you . 
Everybody talks today about happiness . 
I have some people , the number of books counts . Let those with happiness in the title in the last five years have been published . And they gave up after about 40 . And there were many more . 
There &apos;s a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers . 
There &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching . 
Everybody would like to make people happier . 
But despite all this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps . They almost make it impossible . Sure . Thinking about happiness . 
And my talk . Today , it &apos;s mostly these cognitive traps that will act . 
That &apos;s true for laymen . Those who think about their own happiness . And it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness because it turns out we &apos;re just as confused . Like everybody else , 
the first of these traps is to admit a reluctance to complexity . 
It turns out the word happiness is simply not a useful word anymore because we &apos;re giving it up to too many different things . 
I think there &apos;s a certain meaning on which we could limit it . But by and large , this is something we &apos;re going to have to give up . And we &apos;re going to have to take the complicated view . What well @-@ being is 
the second case . Is it a confusion of experience ? And memory , basically , is between happiness . In his life , and being happy about his life , or happy . With his life , 
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both thrown together . In the notion of happiness , 
and the third is the concentration illusion . And that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we don &apos;t think about a fact . Well @-@ being affects without distorting its meaning . 
I mean , this is a real cognitive trap . 
There &apos;s just no way . It &apos;s getting right . 
Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example from someone who had a question and answer session . After one of my lectures , which was a story , he was unclear , he said he &apos;d heard a symphony . And it was absolutely magnificent . ( Music ) And at the very end of the recording , there was a terrible , creeping sound . 
And then he added , &quot; Really , quite emotionally . That &apos;s ruined the whole experience . 
But it didn &apos;t . 
&quot; What it ruined was the memories of the experience . 
It had the experience . 
It had 20 minutes . It had wonderful music . 
It didn &apos;t count because it stayed with a memory . The memory was ruined . And the memory was everything . What it had got to keep , 
what it really tells us is that we are talking about ourselves and about other people . In the sense of two kinds of self , 
there is a living self . That lives in the present , and the present knows , is capable of the past . Reexperience it . But basically , only the present has 
it . It &apos;s the living self . That the doctor is acclaimed . You know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Is it hurting now ? &quot; If I touch you here , 
and then there &apos;s a memory self . And the memory self is that which is widening . And the story of our lives keeps up . And it &apos;s the one that the doctor is addressing by asking the question , &quot; How did you feel lately ? &quot; 
Or &quot; How was your journey to Albania or something like that ? 
&quot; These are two very different units . The living self and the remembering self . And confusing the two is part of the uniformity of the term happiness . 
Now , the remembering self is a storyteller . 
And that really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memories . It starts immediately . 
We &apos;re not just telling stories . If we make ourselves tell stories , 
our memory tells us stories . That means what we keep from our experiences is a story . 
And let &apos;s just start with an example . 
There &apos;s an old study . 
These are real patients . They &apos;re undergoing a painful procedure . 
I &apos;m not going to go into detail . It &apos;s no longer painful today . But it was painful . When this study was done in the 1990s , 
they were asked to go on pain every 60 seconds . And 
here are two patients . These are their records . 
And they &apos;re asked , who of both suffered more ? And 
this is a very simple question . 
Patient B has clearly suffered more . His intestinal reflection was longer . And every minute of pain , the patient had A , patient B and more . 
But now there &apos;s another question . How much did these patients think they suffered , 
and here &apos;s a surprise ? And 
the surprise is that patient A has a much worse reminder of intestinal reflection . When patient B had 
the stories of intestinal reflections , different , and because a very critical part of the story is . How it ends , 
and none of these stories is very edifical . Or great . But one of them is clear . But one of them is significantly worse than the other . 
And the one that is worse was where the pain was at the very end of its peak . It &apos;s a bad story . 
How do we know that ? 
Because we &apos;re going to ask these people about their spinal reflections . And much later . How bad was the whole thing ? Overall , 
and it was much worse for A than for B in memory . 
Well , this is a direct conflict between the living self . And the remembering self 
from the perspective of the living self , B clearly had a worse time . 
Now , what you could do with patient A , and we actually did clinical experiments . And it was done . And it works . You could actually use patient A to prolong the intestinal reflection by just putting the tube inside without being too much attached to it . 
That will make the patient suffer , but only a little bit and much less than before . 
And if you do that for a few minutes , you &apos;ve made the living self of the patient A worse off than that . And you &apos;ve made the remembering self of patient A much better off than that . Because now you have patient A better story about your experience . 
What does a story look like ? 
And that &apos;s true of the stories that memory gives us . And it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent . 
What makes a story special is upheavals , significant moments and ends . 
Ends are very , very important . And in this case , the end dominated . 
Now , the living self is constantly living its life . 
It has moments of experience one after the other . 
And you ask , what happens to these moments ? 
And the answer is really simple . They &apos;re lost forever . 
I mean , most moments of our lives , and I &apos;ve calculated that . You know , the psychological presence is considered for about three seconds . What does it mean ? Do you know that in a life there are about 600 million of them ? In a month , there are about 600,000 , most of them left behind . There &apos;s no trace . 
Most of them are completely ignored . Of the memory self , 
and yet they somehow get the impression that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience . Our life is , 
it &apos;s the limited resource we consume . While we are in this world 
and how we consume it . It would seem important . But that &apos;s not the story . The memory self keeps for us . 
So we have the memory self . And the living self . And they &apos;re really quite different . 
The biggest difference between them is how to deal with time 
from the perspective of the living . Even if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first . Then the two @-@ week holiday is twice as good as the one @-@ week holiday . 
That &apos;s how it works . It &apos;s not at all for the memory . Even 
for the memory self , a two @-@ week holiday is . Hardly better than the one @-@ week holiday , because there are no new memories added . 
You don &apos;t change the story . 
And that &apos;s how time is . Actually , the critical variable that distinguishes a memory self from a living self has time . Very little influence on that story . 
Now , the memory self makes more than remembering . And telling stories . 
It &apos;s actually the one . It makes decisions , because if you have a patient who , let &apos;s say , has two intestinal reflections with two different surgeons . And decides which one to choose . If that &apos;s the one to choose , the one who has the memory that &apos;s less bad . And that &apos;s the surgeon who will be selected . 
The living self has no voice in that choice . 
We &apos;re not actually choosing between experiences . We &apos;re choosing between memories of experiences 
and even experiences . If we think about the future , we think about our future . Normally not as experiences . 
We think about our future . As anticipated memories , 
and basically you can look at that . You know , as a tyranny of the memory self . And you can look at the memory self . Think as one , which kind of drags the living self through experiences that the living self doesn &apos;t need . 
I have the impression that if we go on vacation , that &apos;s very often the case , that means . We go on vacation as far as possible in the service of the memory . Even -- 
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify . I think so . 
I mean , how much food . We learn from our memories . 
That &apos;s one of the explanations that is used for the dominance of the memory self . 
And when I think about it , I think about a vacation that we spent a few years ago in Antarctica , in Antarctica . It &apos;s clearly the best vacation I &apos;ve ever had . And I think about it relatively often relative to how often I think about other vacations 
and I have probably been talking about my memories of it . This three @-@ week journey . I would say , for about 25 minutes , in the last four years . 
Drilled . Well , if I &apos;d ever opened the folder with the 600 images in it , I would have spent another hour . 
Now , that &apos;s three weeks . And that &apos;s at most one and a half hours . 
It seems to be a disagreement . 
Well , I like to be a little extreme . You know , in it , how little appetite ? I &apos;m looking at feeding memories . But even if you do more of that , there &apos;s a real question . Why are we giving memories ? So much weight . In the scourge to weight . That we give experiences . 
So I want you to think about a thought experiment . 
Imagine your next vacation . You know that at the end of your vacation , all your pictures are destroyed . And you get an amnesty drug . So you don &apos;t remember anything . 
Now you would choose the same vacation . And if you choose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species of vacation : Self . And you have to think about how you decide this conflict . And that &apos;s really not obvious at all . Because if you want to think about time , you get an answer . And if you want to think about memories , you could get a different answer . 
Why ? We choose holidays . The one we choose is a problem . That confronts us with a choice between the two types of self . 
Now , the two kinds of self throw two terms of happiness . 
There are actually two concepts of happiness . We can apply one per self . 
So you can ask , how happy is it ? The living self . 
And then you would ask , how happy are the moments in the life of the living person ? Even , 
and you &apos;re all lucky for moments . Is it a pretty complicated one ? Process . 
What are the emotions ? Which can be measured ? 
And by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea . Of the happiness of the living self over time . 
If you look at the happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a very different thing . 
This is not about it . How happy a person lives . 
It &apos;s about how satisfied or happy . The person is when this person is thinking about his or her life . 
Very different terms . 
Anyone who doesn &apos;t differentiate these terms will study happiness . And I &apos;m a lot of researchers about well @-@ being . Those who have long masked the exploration of happiness in exactly this way , 
the distinction between happiness of the living self . And happiness of the remembering self is in recent years recognized . And now you &apos;re trying to separate the two , 
the Gallup Organization has a global survey of the two , where more than half a million people have been asked questions . What they &apos;re asking about their lives . Think about their experiences . And there have been other efforts in the direction . 
In recent years , we &apos;ve started to think about the happiness of the two kinds of self . 
And the main lesson we &apos;ve learned , I think , is that they &apos;re really different . 
You can know how satisfied someone with their lives is . And that really doesn &apos;t teach you much . How happy they are . Life lives . And vice versa . 
Just to give you an idea of correlation . Correlation is about five percent . 
What that means is that if you met someone and you would meet them , you would tell them , &quot; Oh , his father is a two @-@ meter man . &quot; How much would you know about his height ? 
Well , you would know about his size . But there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty . 
You have so much uncertainty . 
If I tell you that someone has his life as eight on a scale of 10 , you know . Do you have a lot of uncertainty about that ? How happy he is with his survivor ? Even 
the correlation is small . 
We know something about what happiness self happiness determines . 
We know money is very important . Goals are very important . 
We know happiness is primarily about being satisfied with people we &apos;re like , time to spend . With people we like , 
there &apos;s other pleasure . But that &apos;s dominant . 
So if you &apos;re lucky about the two kinds of self , you &apos;re going to end up doing very different things . So 
the conclusion from what I &apos;ve said here is that we &apos;re really not imagining happiness really . As a substitute for well @-@ being , 
it &apos;s a completely different term . 
Now , very briefly . Another reason we don &apos;t know clearly about happiness is because of the fact that we don &apos;t think about the same things . When we think about life , and when we actually live , 
so when you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California , people will not be the correct answer . 
If you ask that question , do you think that people in California need to be happier ? If you say , &quot; We live in Ohio , &quot; 
and what happens is that if you talk about life in California , think about the difference between California and others , you know ? And that difference is , say , climate . 
Well , it turns out climate isn &apos;t very important to the living self . And it &apos;s not even very important for the thoughtful . Even that decides how happy people are . 
Now , because the thoughtful self is responsible , you can end up with some people . At the end , they can move to California , 
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track . What happens to people ? They go to California hoping to be happier . 
Well , their living self won &apos;t be happier . 
We know that . 
But one thing will happen . You &apos;ll think you &apos;re happier . Because if you think about that , you &apos;ll be reminded of how terrible . The weather in Ohio was , and you &apos;ll feel you &apos;re making the right decision . 
It &apos;s very difficult to think clearly about well @-@ being . And I hope I have an impression of how difficult it is to think about it . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question for you . 
Thank you very much . 
Well , when we telephoned a couple of weeks ago , you told me that it was a pretty interesting result . This from this Gallup survey came out of it , 
is that something you &apos;re participating in ? Because you can now leave a few minutes . 
Daniel Kahneman : Sure . 
I think the most interesting result . The one we found in the Gallup survey is a number that we absolutely don &apos;t find to be . 
We found that in terms of happiness for the survivor himself . 
If we looked at how feelings with income vary , 
and it turns out that among the Gallup poll &apos;s income of 60,000 dollars , in the year , for Americans . And that &apos;s a very big sample of Americans . About 600,000 . But it &apos;s a big representative sample . Under an income of 600,000 dollars a year . 
About 60,000 . 
DK : 60,000 , 
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy . And they &apos;re getting increasingly unhappy . The poorer they get about 
it . We get an absolutely flat line . 
I mean , I rarely saw such flat lines . 
What happens is , obviously , money doesn &apos;t get you luck with adventure . But that lack of money certainly gives you misery . And we can get this misery very , very clear . 
In the sense of the other self , the memory self , you get a different story . 
The more money you make , the more satisfied you are . 
That &apos;s not true of emotions . 
CA : But Danny , throughout America , this is about life . Freedom , the quest for happiness . 
When people take this finding seriously , I think it seems . Everything on the head . Everything we believe , for example , in tax policy and so on . 
Is there an opportunity for politicians to see that the country in general has a finding like seriousness ? And based on that , politics would do 
DK , you know , I think there &apos;s recognition for the role of gambling research in politics . 
Recognition will be slow . In the United States , no question . But in the United Kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now . And in other countries , it &apos;s happening right now . 
People are recognizing that they &apos;re lucky thinking about happiness . If you think about politics , 
it &apos;s going to take a while . And people will discuss whether to explore experience happiness . Or whether to explore life assessment . So we need this discussion . Very soon , 
how to increase happiness . It &apos;s very different . Depending on how you think . And whether you think about the memory self , or whether you think about the living self . 
That will affect politics . I think so . In the years ahead , 
in the United States , you &apos;re tightening on the experience happiness of the population . 
That , I think , will be in the next decade or two part of national statistics . 
CA : Well , it seems to me that this topic is , or should at least be , the most interesting political debate to follow . Over the next few years , 
thank you very much . For the invention of behavioral economics . 
Thank you . Danny Kahneman : Today 
I &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate . 
And that &apos;s surprising . Maybe something because my full @-@ time work at the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds , about the things we invent . And we need to deliver to the poorest two billion to make a better life possible . 
But energy and climate are extremely important . For these people , in fact , even more important than for everyone . For others on the planet , 
climate degradation means that their seeds don &apos;t grow for many years . It means we &apos;re raining too much or too little . Things will change that way . As your fragile environment cannot endure . 
That leads to starvation . It leads to insecurity . It leads to unrest . 
So climate change is going to be terrible for you . And 
also , the energy price for you is . Very important . 
The fact is , if you &apos;re talking about just one thing , you could reduce the price , to reduce poverty , energy would be by far the most effective . 
Now , the energy price has fallen over time . 
In fact , the progress society is based on energy advances , which have 
driven coal evolution , the Industrial Revolution . And even in the 20th century , there was a rapid fall in the electricity price , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , air conditioning . We can make modern materials . And so many things we do . 
We are . So in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world . 
But if we let the price down , we let the price halve , we hit . We hit a new barrier , and this barrier is related to CO2 , 
CO2 warms the planet . And the equation for CO2 is actually pretty clear . 
They sum up the CO2 emitted , which leads to temperature increase . And this temperature increase has some very negative consequences . Effects on the weather . And maybe worse , the indirect consequence is that natural ecosystems are undergoing such rapid changes that they cannot adapt . And so whole 
systems collapse , now the exact link between a CO2 increase and the resulting temperature change . And where the consequences are , there are some ambiguities . But not very many . 
And there &apos;s certainly uncertainty about how bad these consequences are going to be . But they &apos;re going to be extremely bad . 
I &apos;ve asked the top scientists several times , &quot; Do we really have to get down to near zero ? 
&quot; &quot; Is not enough . &quot; Half or a quarter . 
&quot; The answer is , &quot; Until we get near zero . &quot; &quot; The temperature will continue to rise . 
&quot; So it &apos;s a big challenge . 
It &apos;s quite different from saying . We have a three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ foot truck that has to come under a three @-@ meter bridge . You can sort of squeeze that underneath . This 
has to be downwards to zero . 
Well , we run into zero every year . A lot of carbon dioxide out of over 26 billion tons . 
Every American , about 20 tons . People from poor countries , less than one on average , 
it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet . 
And somehow we have to make changes . They have to reduce that to zero . 
It &apos;s been constantly increasing . 
Only different economic changes have affected it at all . And we have to move from rapid growth to reduction . And to a reduction to zero . 
This equation has four factors . A little multiplication . You &apos;ve got this thing on the left , CO2 . You &apos;re trying to get it to zero . And that &apos;s going to depend on the number of people , on the services that every human being uses on average . The average energy for every service . And the CO2 . That &apos;s emitted per unit of energy , 
so let &apos;s look at each factor individually . And let &apos;s think about how we get that to zero . 
One of these numbers probably has to come very close to zero . 
Now , this is basic algebra . But let &apos;s go . First of 
all , we have the population . 
Today , 6.8 billion people live 
, and it &apos;s going to go to 9 billion . 
That &apos;s going to move to 9 billion . If we succeed very successfully with new vaccines , healthcare and reproductive medicine , we might well have 10 to 15 percent lower that . But right now we &apos;re seeing a 1.3 percent rise , 
the second factor is the services we use . 
That &apos;s all . The food we eat : Clothing , television , heating . 
These are very good things . And poverty reduction means these services to almost everyone on the planet . 
It &apos;s great that this number is rising 
in the rich world , in the top billion , we might be able to make cuts . And use less , but on average , this number is going to increase every year . And so overall , more than double the number of services per person provided , in fact . So 
here we see a very basic service : Is there light at home ? So you can read the homework , 
and these students have . It &apos;s not . So they go out . And they read . They do their homework . Under the street light . 
Now , effectiveness , the E : The energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news . 
We have something that doesn &apos;t go up . 
Because of various successes in the lighting sector , by other types of cars , by new methods . In housing , there are many services whose energy is spent . They can drastically reduce . Drastically reduce . 103.00 @ 05.05 50 
000 GT 00 05 53 000 Some services 90 % reduction 
Some individual services 90 % reduction Other services , such as fertilisers production ( 105.00 - 05.56.000.000 ) , GT 00 05 58 000 or the aviation sector or air transport , are subject to improvement , and there is much smaller 
scope for improvement . Overall , if we are optimistic , we may be able to achieve a 3 factor reduction or perhaps even a 6 factor reduction . 
But in the first three factors , we &apos;re now from 26 billion to maybe the very best 13 billion tons . And that &apos;s just not enough . 
So let &apos;s look at the fourth factor . And this will be a key factor . That &apos;s the amount of CO2 per unit of energy emitted . 
It &apos;s the question of whether you can get that to zero . 
If you burn coal , no , 
if you burn natural gas , no , 
almost every method of making electricity . Today , CO2 emits , except renewable energy . And nuclear energy , 
so what we do on a global scale , is a new system to 
create . We need energy cycles . 
Now , if I use the term &quot; wonder , &quot; I don &apos;t mean . The impossible , 
the microprocessor , is a miracle . The PC is a miracle . 
The Internet and its services are a miracle . 
The people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles . 
Normally , there &apos;s no deadline for you to do a miracle by a certain date . 
Normally , you &apos;re just standing next to it . And some don &apos;t come to others . In 
this case , we have to give full gas . And a miracle in a very short time , 
well , I wondered , how can I really get that over ? 
Is there a natural illustration ? A demonstration that illustrates the idea of people here . 
I remembered last year , when I brought mosquitos . And somehow , people liked that , 
which became the idea that was really tangible to them . You know , there are people who live with mosquitos 
, and energy fell . So this is me . 
I decided that releasing fireflies was my contribution this year to the environment here . 
So here are some natural fireflies . 
I &apos;ve been assured they &apos;re not biting , actually . They probably won &apos;t even leave the glass . 
Well , there are all kinds of game solutions like this . But they &apos;re not all doing much . 
We need solutions . Either one or more that can scale unimaginable and unimaginable reliability . And though there are many directions where people are looking for it . I really see only five that are able to meet these big challenges . 
I have tides , geothermal fusion and biofuels . 
These may make a moderate contribution , and if they do better than I expect , that would be great . But my key message here is that we have to work on all those five . And we can &apos;t give up on them because they intimidate us . Because everybody has significant problems . 
Let &apos;s first look at them . Burning fossil fuels . Burning either coal or natural gas , 
which you have to do there . Maybe it just seems . But that &apos;s not it . You have to have all that CO2 . That after burns out of the chimney comes in , captured , under pressure . Liquid and then store somewhere . And hope it stays there . 
There are some pilot projects that do that at a 60 / 80 level . But it &apos;s getting to 100 , it &apos;s going to be very difficult . And reaching an agreement on storing CO2 will be a big deal , a challenge . But the biggest problem here is storing time . 
Who &apos;s going to make sure ? 
Who can guarantee something ? What literally is many billion times bigger ? Throughout all kinds of waste you get from nuclear and other things , 
you can imagine . That &apos;s a lot of volume . 
So that &apos;s a hard nut . 
Next , nuclear energy . 
It also has three big problems . The cost , especially in highly regulated countries , is high . The question of security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong . Despite human collaboration , that the fuel is not used for weapons . 
And what do you do ? Then with the waste . 
Because even though it &apos;s not very big , there are a lot of concerns . 
People have to feel good about it . 184,00 , 10 , 20,000 GT , 00 , 10 , 25,000 . So three very difficult problems . They may be solvable , 
so three very difficult problems . They may be solvable , and so you should work on them . 
The last three of the five I &apos;ve summarized . 
They &apos;re renewable energy , as they &apos;re often called . 
And they also have , although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel . They have some disadvantages . 
One is the energy density that these technologies generate is dramatically lower . When power plants -- 
these are low @-@ energy . You talk about many square kilometers , thousands of times more space than a normal power plant -- and they &apos;re 
also subject to . These sources are interruptions , 
the sun doesn &apos;t shine all day long . Nor does it shine every day . And the wind doesn &apos;t blow all the time . 
So if you &apos;re from these sources , you have to have a way to use energy even in times . If it &apos;s not available to 
get it , so there are big price challenges here . There are challenges in transmission . For example , if we say that the energy source is outside the country , you don &apos;t just need technology . You also need to deal with the risk that the energy is coming from where it 
comes from , and there is . The storage problem . 
And to show the dimension , I &apos;ve looked at all kinds of batteries that are made . The ones for cars , computers , mobile phones , flashlights for everything , and I &apos;ve done this with the amount of electronic energy that the world uses . I found that all the batteries that we &apos;re now producing are less than 10 minutes of total energy storage . 
Could we need a big breakthrough here ? Something that could be 100 percent better by one factor . When the approaches at the moment — 
that &apos;s not impossible . But it &apos;s not that easy . 
That happens when you try to find these interrupted sources , say , 20 @-@ 30 percent of consumption . When they get 
100 percent based on that , they need an incredible wonder battery . 
Now , where are we going to go ? What &apos;s the right approach ? 
A Manhattan project . How do we get to the finish ? 
What we need is a lot of companies . They &apos;re working on it , hundreds of them . 
In each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people . 
In many , they &apos;ll say , &quot; They &apos;re crazy . &quot; That &apos;s good . 
I think here in the TED group , there are many who are already engaged . 
Bill Gross has several companies , including one called Esolar , which has great solar thermal technologies . 
Vinod Khosla is investing in dozens of companies doing great things . And have interesting opportunities , and I &apos;m trying to support that . 
Nathan Myhrvold and I are funding a company that , surprisingly , is perhaps pursuing the nuclear approach . 
There are some innovations in the nuclear field : Modular , liquid , 
the development has in this industry . Some time ago , it stopped , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are lying around . 
The Terrapower concept means that instead of a part of the uranium , one percent , you have the U235 . We decided to burn the 99 . The U238 , that 
&apos;s a pretty crazy idea . But 
in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time . But you could never simulate it sensibly . Whether it would work . But since there are modern supercomputers , you can simulate it . And you can see that , yes , with the right approach to matter . It looks like it works , 
and because you burn these 99 is . The cost profile is much better . In fact , 
you burn the garbage , and you can even burn the garbage from today &apos;s reactors . 
You use it as a drive , rather than breaking your head , you just burn it . A great thing . 
The uranium is being used gradually . A little bit like a candle . 
You can see that it &apos;s a kind of column . It &apos;s often called a wandering wave reactor , 
which really solves it . The fuel problem . 
Here &apos;s a picture of a place . In Kentucky , 
this is the waste . The 99 . You have the part that &apos;s burned today . You have taken it out . So it &apos;s called &quot; Abused . 
&quot; Uranium : That shoots . The U.S. : For hundreds of years . 
And if you buy ocean water cheaply and simply filtered , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet &apos;s 
life . You know , there are many challenges there . But it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts . They need to move forward . 
Let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success 
. How should our testimony look ? 
Well , we go to the finish line . We need to achieve that , and then talk . We talk about the intermediate step 
, many talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 . 
It &apos;s really , really important that we get there . 
The remaining 20 percent is going to be produced in poor countries , and still some agriculture . Hopefully , forest threats and cement will be . Until then , clean . 
So , to get there , to get there , the developed world , including countries like China , has to be . Completely reorganizing their generation of electricity . 
The other note says , are we using zero emissions technology , are they in all developed countries ? And we &apos;re on the way to getting them to the 
rest . That &apos;s super important . 
That &apos;s going to be a key element of this stuff . 
If we go back from there , how should that 2020 be testimony ? 
It should be back in the two elements . 
We should use the effectiveness measures to get reduction on the way . The less we emit , the lower the carbon sum will be . And so will the temperature . 
But actually , this note is for the things we do , the things that are not completely leading to the big reductions . Just the same , or even a little less important . Like the others , who care about the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs . 
We need to track these breakthroughs with full @-@ gas . And we can measure that . In company numbers , in pilot projects and regulatory changes , 
there are many great books on this subject . 
Al Gore book . We have the choice . And David McKay &apos;s Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air . They 
really go through it . And they create a framework where this is widely discussed . Because we need support from all sides for this . 
There are some things that need to come together . 
That &apos;s a wish . 
A very concrete wish that we invent this technology . 
If you just want me a wish for the next 50 years . I could choose the president , a vaccine , and that &apos;s what I love . I , or ? I could choose that wish . That is half the energy price . Without CO2 , it &apos;s invented . That &apos;s what I would like to 
see . This one has the greatest impact . 
If we don &apos;t get that wish , the gap between the long @-@ term and the short @-@ term will be . People will be terrible between the United States and China , between poor and rich countries . And almost all of them live . These two billion will be much worse . 
So what do we have to do ? 
What measures do I appeal for ? 
We have to work for more research funding . 
If countries are in places like Koppenhagen , they should not just be talking about CO2 . 
They should be discussing this innovation strategy . And they would be shocked by the ridiculously low money that is being spent on these innovative approaches . 
We need market incentives , carbon taxes , cap &amp; amp ; trade , something that sends out a price signal . 
We need to spread the news . 
We need dialogue , rationality and completeness . And the things that government is doing are also things . 
It &apos;s an important wish . But I think we can fulfill it . 
Thank you very much . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . Thank you . 
Thank you very much . Just to make Terrapower a little better understood . First of all , you can give us an idea of the scale of this investment . 
Bill Gates : To simulate on a supercomputer , all the big scientists get . What we &apos;ve done is we just need a few 10 million . And even if we put our materials in a Russian reactor to make sure it &apos;s reasonable to work . Is it only in the 100 million that 
the difficult step is to build the first reactor ? Find another billion , the regulations and the place that &apos;s actually the first to build . 
Once the first is finished , when it &apos;s going as promised , everything is very clear . Because the economic viability , the energy density , is so different from nuclear energy as we are . 
You know about this , to understand it correctly . That means deep . You know , building into the ground almost like a vertical . Pillar of nuclear fuel , this consumed uranium , and then the process starts at the top . And it continues to work down . 
BG : Exactly . Today , you have to refill the reactor . So there are lots of people and lots of controls that go wrong . Can this thing where you open it ? And bring things in or out ? That &apos;s not good . 
But if you have very cheap fuel , you can refill it for 60 years . Think of a column that you bury . Without all the complexities . 
And it sits there . And it burns for 60 years . And then it &apos;s done . 
CA : A nuclear reactor . The self @-@ solution for garbage . 
BG : Yeah . Now , what happens to garbage ? You can sit there . There &apos;s much less garbage with this method . Then take it and put it in the next reactor . And burn it further . 
And we start by taking the garbage . It already exists , which exists in these refrigerators or dry tanks at the reactors . That &apos;s our starting fuel . So what is 
that for these reactors was a problem ? What we do in our fill , and that &apos;s dramatically reducing the garbage volume . During this process , 
about , but while you &apos;re talking to different people around the world about these possibilities . 
Where is the biggest ? Interest , like that . What really to do ? 
BG : Well , we haven &apos;t yet set ourselves in place . And there &apos;s a lot of interesting disclosure rules for everything . The nuclear in the name is there . There &apos;s a lot of interest . And the people of the company were in Russia , India . China , I was here . And I met the energy minister . And I talked about how this fits into the energy agenda . 
I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the French . And Japanese have something in the direction . 
This is a variant . One thing that was done , 
this is an important step forward . But it &apos;s like a fast reactor . And some countries have built this . So anyone who &apos;s implemented a fast reactor is a candidate for our first one . 
CA : In your imagination , timeframe and probability . So , to really bring this into being . 
BG : Well , we need one of these scalable , power generating things that is very cheap . We &apos;ve got 20 years to invent , and then 20 years to deploy . 
This is kind of the deadline . The environmental models that we &apos;ve been shown to be compliant with . 
And you know , Terrapower ? If everything goes well , and this is a big wish , could it ? Keep it easy , 
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds that are the same . If their approaches work , the promotion for their pilots works . Can provide that , 
and it would be best if several could do it . Because then you could use a mix . In any case , 
we need a solution . 
CA : Concerning the big possible breakthroughs , this is the biggest one . You know that . 
BG : An energy break . Is that the most important thing ? 
It would be without the environmental challenge . But it &apos;s still so much more important . 
In the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies . 
You know , we don &apos;t know how to do their work as well as they do . But there &apos;s the modular method . That &apos;s a different approach . 
There &apos;s a liquid reactor type that seems a little difficult . But maybe they say that about us . 
And so there are different ones . But the nice thing about this is that a uranium molecule is a million times as much energy as saying . We , a carbon molecule , and that &apos;s why , if you can deal with the problems , and they &apos;re mainly the radiation of the footprint . And the cost is the potential . So the impact on the country and other things , almost in a league of its own . 
CA : If that doesn &apos;t work , what 
do we have to do is take emergency measures to try to keep the Earth temperature stable ? 
BG : If you get into this situation , it &apos;s as if you ate too much . And just before a heart attack , you &apos;re about to say , &quot; What do you do ? &quot; Then you might need a heart surgery or something like that . 
There &apos;s a research that &apos;s called geoengineering . It &apos;s about different techniques to deal with the delay in warming . So that we can get 20 or 30 years longer to get together . 
That &apos;s just an insurance method . 
You hope we don &apos;t need that . 
Some people say you shouldn &apos;t be at insurance at all because you get that lazy , maybe , so you keep eating , because you know you &apos;re going to have heart surgery rescuing you . 
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart . If you look at the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you &apos;re going to have that at your disposal . If things get faster or this innovation takes longer than we expect . 
CA : Climate skeptics , do you have one or two sentences for those around ? Maybe convince them . 
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps . 
Those who make scientific arguments are very little , 
say . They say there are negative effects that are associated with clouds . They move things . 
There are very , very few things they can even say . Of those , there &apos;s a chance in a million . 
The main problem here is very much like AIDS . 
You make the mistake . Now , and you pay for it much later . 
And so the idea now is , if you can have all kinds of urgent problems . Investing in something you &apos;re going to do later , what &apos;s going on ? And then the investment doesn &apos;t get so clear . In fact , the IPCC Report isn &apos;t necessarily . The worst scenario . And there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC . And they say , &quot; Okay , this is not a big drama . The 
fact is that this uncertainty is supposed to worry us . 
But my dream here is that if you make it economically and at the same time eliminate CO2 . &quot; And then the skeptics say , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know . Okay . &quot; I &apos;m not interested in it emitting CO2 . I almost wish it did . But I &apos;m probably going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . CA 
: And that would be your answer to the Björn Lomborg argument that if you were to spend all of this time and energy on the CO2 problem , you would have to solve it . All the other goals , including poverty reduction , malaria control and so on , are suffering from it , and it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources . Money . Investing for it . While there are better things we can do . 
BG : Well , the actual spending on research , let &apos;s say the U.S. should be 10 billion a year . Expenditure more than you do today . That &apos;s not so dramatic . Underneath 
it , other things should not suffer . 
You get to big amounts of money . And here , reasonable people can disagree . If you have something that &apos;s not economic and try to finance it . For me , most waste is happening here . 
Unless you &apos;re very short . Before a cost breakthrough , and only finances the learning curve . I think we should try more things that have the potential . Very much cheaper . 
If the swab you get is a very high energy price . Then only the rich can keep up . 
I mean , each of us here could five times as much for our energy . Without changing our lifestyle , for 
the bottom two billion . But is it a disaster ? And 
even Lomborg thinks about 
his new mesh , &quot; Why is research not going to be discussed anymore ? &quot; 
He &apos;s still being discussed because of his earlier stories with the skeptic camp . But he understood that this is a very lonely group . And so he &apos;s now bringing the research argument , 
and this is a thought that I think is appropriate . 
Research , it &apos;s just crazy . How little support is being given to this ? CA 
: Bill . I think I speak for almost all people . Here , when I say , &quot; I really hope that your wish will come true . &quot; Thank you very much . 
BG : Thank you . 
I &apos;d like to tell you something . What I got a few months ago when I wrote an article for Italian Wired . 
Is it me who wrote ? Is it always my synonymous dictionary that &apos;s ready for use ? But I was involved in editing the text . It &apos;s done . And I noticed that I &apos;ve never been in my life looking at it . What really hampers the word ? I &apos;ll 
read you the entry &quot; disabled &quot; . 
&quot; Crippled &quot; adjective . &quot; Helpless , useless , destroyed . &quot; &quot; Deceased , mutilated . &quot; &quot; Wounded , prepared , paralyzed . &quot; &quot; Separated &quot; &quot; Keep &quot; &quot; Determined , weakened &quot; &quot; Impotent &quot; &quot; Castriert &quot; &quot; Paralyzed &quot; &quot; @ geandicapt &quot; &quot; Senil &quot; &quot; Poor age &quot; &quot; Improved , done &quot; &quot; Dead &quot; &quot; Gebirsten &quot; &quot; Counted &quot; ( see also &quot; injured &quot; ) &quot; Useless &quot; &quot; And &quot; weak &quot; 
&quot; Anonyme &quot; ( healthy ) &quot; Positive &quot; 
I have this list read out loud to a friend . And I had to laugh first . It worked so ridiculous . But I just got ready and couldn &apos;t speak any more . And I had to stop reading . And first of all , collect me after this invincible flood of words . 
And the emotional shock that comes with it . Of course , this was a fractured old synonym dictionary . I just thought that the issue was pretty old , it had 
to be . But in fact , it was an issue in the early &apos; 80s . When I was just beginning primary school , and that started my self @-@ image outside of my family environment . And also to shape it in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me . 
And thank God I didn &apos;t have used a synonymous dictionary at the time . 
I would take this entry seriously . Take it into a world that someone like me would have been born to perceive as a person whose life is in no way positive . But can I do it today ? Will I be able to work for the opportunities and adventures I &apos;ve experienced ? So 
I was celebrating the online edition of 2009 . And I expected that I could find a more appealing contribution here . 
Here &apos;s the updated version . This entry , 
unfortunately , is not much better . 
In particular , the last two words under Near Antonym shake me . All right and healthy . But 
it &apos;s not just about the words . 
It &apos;s about what we think about people . We think about these words , 
it &apos;s about the values that are in those words . And how we construct those values . 
Our language influences our thinking and how we influence the world and people around us . 
Many ancient societies , including Greeks and Romans , really believed that we could have a debate on a curse , a great force , because what we call loud is that what we can manifest . 
So what do we want ? We actually manifest a disabled person or a powerful person alone . We already 
have a person who could be considered careless as a child . Restricting them and putting ideas over them would not be more beautiful 
to open doors to them . A 
person . The doors that opened doors to me were my pediatrician . AM A.I. DuPont Institute in Wilmington , Delaware . 
His name is Dr. Pizzutillo , an Italo @-@ American whose name , you can imagine , is : Most Americans don &apos;t have the right language to pronounce correctly , so he was always called Dr. P. 
And Dr. P. always wore very colorful flies . And he was very busy working with kids . 
Simply made . I found the time I was in this hospital . Simply great except for my physiotherapy . 
I had to do some exercises , seemingly infinitely . With these thick elastic bands in different colors . You know that . To build my leg muscles , and I hated these bands more . As anything else , I hated them . I cursed them . I hated them . 
And imagine I &apos;ve even been in the age of five with Dr. P. negotiating with Dr. P. And so this is how to stop these exercises . Natural , without success . 
And one day he cursed me at one of my exercises . These exercises were just tiring . And mercilessly , and he said to me , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you &apos;re such a strong guy . Strong and young girl , you &apos;ll one day tear one of these bands . 
And if you can do it , I &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot; 
That was , of course , just a simple trick by Dr. P. to do the exercises . I didn &apos;t want to do that with the prospect that richest five @-@ year @-@ old girls in the hospital will be on the second floor . But he actually got me to do that . My daily exercise horror with new eyes . So it turned into a new and promising experience . 
And I wonder today how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl . Shaped my self @-@ image , and I could imagine myself as one of nature &apos;s strong , powerful and atlethic people , seeing myself as one of the most atlethic . 
This is just one example of many , like adults . In power positions that can inspire a child &apos;s 
imagination , but like the examples already cited from the synonymous dictionaries , our language doesn &apos;t allow us any space to imagine something . What we all want would be for each and every one of us to be able to see themselves as powerful people . 
Our language lags behind social change . In many cases , technological change has triggered the medical shift , from a medical point of view . 
Of course , you can say that my legs , laser surgery for visually impaired , knee joints made of titanium and artificial hip joints . For aging bodies that allow people to really all their possibilities to use . And beyond the limits that their natural destiny sets them , beyond the limits . Not to speak at all . Not to talk about social networking platforms , people allow themselves to have their own identity , give themselves their own way of defining . And thus , 
they orient themselves globally to groups that they choose . 
So maybe this technological change makes it clearer . Because ever since , it &apos;s always been a different truth , that every human being in society has something very special and very powerful to give . And that human ability to adapt . Our greatest plus is 
human ability to adapt . This is an interesting story . Because people keep asking me to tell me how to deal with adversity and I &apos;m going to give you something . This sentence never fit me . And I &apos;ve always been very uncomfortable with the questions people ask about it , and I &apos;ve always felt that I understand . I understand why . 
This sentence about dealing with adversity lives from the idea that success or happiness depends on it . Tackling a challenge without being affected by the experience that it brings . As if my life had been so successful , because I could see the possible traps of a life with a prosthesis . Or anyway , people , with my disability , perceive me . 
But the truth is that we change . Of course , we are shaped by the challenge . Whether they &apos;re physical , emotional or even both , 
and I claim that that &apos;s good . 
Adversity is not an obstacle . We need to curve that to better understand our lives . 
Adversity is simply part of our lives . 
And I tend to think of adversity as my shadow . 
Sometimes I realize it &apos;s very present . Sometimes it &apos;s hard to see . But it &apos;s always with me . 
And I don &apos;t want to mean the impact or severity of a human struggle to be reduced . 
There are adversity and challenges in life . And they &apos;re all too real . And every person is different with it . But the question is not whether we can be clear with adversity or not . But how we can get clear with it , 
so we &apos;re not just responsible for it . The people we love to save from blows of fate , but also to prepare them for it . All right . 
To get clear . And we &apos;re not doing our kids a favor . If we give them the feeling that they don &apos;t adapt . 
You have to separate two things clearly . One is that the medical fact of being amputated and the other is that it &apos;s . The social opinion about whether I &apos;m disabled or not . 
And to be honest , the only real and lasting disability with which I &apos;m dealing is the only real disability that I have had to deal with is that the world is constantly saying . It can connect with these definitions . 
In our desire to protect the people who care about us . And to tell you the cold , hard truth about your medical prognosis . Or even a prognosis about quality of life . Imagine that you expect , we need to be careful not to lay the foundation for somebody actually being disabled . 
Maybe the current concept is . It &apos;s just about what &apos;s broken . And how we fix that for each individual , greater disability than pathology , in itself . 
If we don &apos;t treat a person holistically and not all of his forces . And perceive possibilities . And acknowledge , in addition to the natural struggle that you might need to fight . 
Another disease . We degrade a person who is responsible for our society . 
So we need to go beyond patology . Look and look at all areas of human potential . 
Most importantly . But is it that there is a gap between perception of our inadequacies and our great inventive spirit ? 
We should not devalue these challenging times or deny them . We should not try to avoid them . We should not try to sweep them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about opportunities in adversity . 
I may be more interested in making it clear that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome adversity , but that we are open to it . Embrace them . Embrace them to grab the head , to also use a campaign expression . And maybe even dance with it . 
And maybe we can do adversity as something natural , coherent . And see useful . And feel us through their presence , no more . So 
this year , we celebrate the 200th anniversary of Charles . Darwin , and when he was 150 years ago writing about evolution , Darwin , in my view , has something very true in human character . 
I would rewrite it like this : Not the strongest of its kind survives . Nor does Darwin , the smartest of its kind , but the one who can best adapt to change . 
Conflict creates creativity , not just 
from Darwin &apos;s work . Do we know that human ability to survive and flourish from struggle of human mind ? It &apos;s determined to change through conflict . 
So change again . And adaptation is the greatest human ability . 
And maybe we know only from what wood . We &apos;re carved when we &apos;re really tested . 
Maybe that &apos;s the sense of adversity . A perception of ego . A sense of our own power . 
We can feel something like that . 
We can give adversity a new meaning that goes beyond difficult times . 
Maybe we can see adversity as change . 
Adversity represents a change . We don &apos;t yet adapt . 
I think the greatest damage we have done to ourselves is to believe that we are 
normal . Let &apos;s be honest . Who is normal ? 
There is no normal . 
There is the usual . The typical , but not . The normal . And would you like to really know this poor , gray person ? Do you want to learn if there were really ? 
I don &apos;t think so . 
It would be great . If we could counter this pattern of normality against another , the possibility or the strength , to even a little more dangerous to put it . Could exchange . So we can exchange the forces of very many children . And invite them to release their very special and valuable skills into society . 
Anthropolgen has found that we humans are being led by the members of our society to always have one thing to do : To be useful . And to contribute . 
There are indications that even Neanderthals are 60 000 years ago older people and people with human difficulty with physical injuries , with having worn . And that might have happened because life experience in these people &apos;s struggle for survival was valuable to society . 
They don &apos;t break these people . And they were seen as useless . They were seen as something special . And valuable was treated . 
A few years ago , I went to the city where I grew up . I went to a food market in that Red Zone in the northeast of Pennsylvania , and I stood in front of a cup of tomatoes . 
It was summer . And I had shorts , and 
I hear a guy behind me say , &quot; Well , if that &apos;s not Aimee Mullins , 
and I turn around and see this older man . &quot; I had no idea . Who he is . 
And I said , &quot; Excuse me . &quot; Sir , do we know ? I can &apos;t remember you , and 
he said , &quot; Well , you &apos;re unlikely to be . &quot; 
I remember when I first saw you , I first saw you out of your mother &apos;s belly . 
Oh , so , he 
did . And of course it did . But click . 
That was Dr. Kean , a man I only made from my mother &apos;s stories about that day . Because of course I was typical of my birthday , two weeks late 
, the doctor for prenatal diagnostics . My mother was on vacation , and so my parents knew the man who gave me birth . Not at all . 
And because I was born without a calf &apos;s legs . And my feet were directed towards them , and I just had a few toes on this one and a few toes . On the other foot , it was the carrier , this stranger had to deliver the bad news . 
He said to me , &quot; I had to tell your parents that you would never walk . And never be as mobile as other kids , or you would never be an independent life . &quot; And they &apos;ve just been lying to me since , and they &apos;ve been able to . Really punished . Exceptionally 
, I found that he &apos;s collected newspaper clips of my entire childhood . Whether I was competing for a letter in second grade . Whether I was winning with the scouts at Halloween Parade , regardless of whether I was on my scholarship or one of my sporting victories . And he used these clips to get his students to teach . Medical students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School , 
and he called this part of his course the X factor . The potential of human will , 
you can &apos;t stress enough how crucial this factor is for quality of life of a human being . 
And Dr. Kean continued , he said , &quot; I learned that if children don &apos;t always do something else , they get to say something else . And even if they just get a little bit of support , if you leave children to themselves , then children can do a lot . Look 
. Dr. Kean has his . Thinking changed . 
He had understood that medical diagnosis and how someone deals with it . 
Two different things are : And I too have my thinking over time changed . If you &apos;ve changed me at the age of 15 , would you have asked me if I could have changed my prostheses against legs made of meat and bones ? Would I not have hesitated for a second ? 
I absolutely wanted to be normal at the time . 
If you ask me that today , I &apos;m not so sure . 
And that &apos;s what happened . Because I have experienced something with my legs . And not despite these experiences . 
And maybe that change could happen because I &apos;ve been meeting so many people . I &apos;ve opened doors instead of meeting people who restrict me or restrict me or overtake an idea . You 
see , it really only takes one person . He &apos;s demonstrating to you how you can manifest your forces . And you &apos;re through 
if you allow someone to . His own inner forces to activate . The human mind is so receptive . If you can do that and for someone at a critical moment , open a door . Then you &apos;re for these people . A very good teacher . 
You teach them to bring themselves doors to open . 
The real meaning of the word educate is rooted in the word educe . It 
means creating something that is in one , the potential to tickle out , 
again , what potential do you want ? So we &apos;re going to call you up 
. In the &apos; 60s , a case study was done in the United Kingdom . Back then , high schools were transformed into schools . 
They call this streaming trials . In the United States , we call this tracking . 
Students are becoming . They &apos;re divided into grades , and 
the A students are getting more audited orally . The better teachers , etc . 
, they have students with a three @-@ month period , with a sufficiently good grade . They were told . They were Aces that they were very smart . And after those three months , they really wrote Einster . 
And of course , it breaks you up to hear the heart , that the other way around , the Einster students were told . They were just enough , 
and that was the same . Then , after the three months , too . But only 
those who still in school were , apart from the students who were in school , who had thrown the school . 
And the crucial thing about this study was that the teachers were not inaugurated . 
The teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed . 
They were simply told that the Einser students were , and that the students with the grade were sufficient , and they were just teaching them something . 
And she treats the only real disability is a broken mind . A spirit that was broken has no hope anymore . It &apos;s not beautiful anymore . It lacks our natural , childish . Curiosity . And our innate ability to imagination , but 
if we can do it , the human mind can help with it . And then hoping to continue to look at ourselves and other people around us beautifully . Curiously and imaginatively , we put our forces really positively . 
One , if a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new forms of existence . 
I want to end with a poem . This is from a Persian poet named Hafiz , written in the 14th century . And from which my friend Jacques Dembois told me , and the poem is called &quot; The God Who Was Only Four Words . &quot; Every child doesn &apos;t know God , the God . The name , not the God of prohibitions , but the God . The only one who knows four words and repeats them all the time . He only always says , 
&quot; Come dance with me . &quot; &quot; Come dance with me . &quot; Thank you very much .
