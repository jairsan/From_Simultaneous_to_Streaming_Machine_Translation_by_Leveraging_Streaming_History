A few years ago here at TED , Peter Skillman presented a design competition called &quot; The Marshmallow Challenge . 
&quot; The idea is pretty simple . Four teams have to have the widest possible freestanding structure with 20 spaghetti . CA : 1m tape . CA : 1m thread and build a marshmallow , 
the marshmallow has to be up on top . 
And though it really seems easy , it &apos;s actually really hard . Because it &apos;s pushing people to work together very quickly . 
And so I thought this is an interesting idea . And I turned it into a design workshop . 
It was a huge success . 
Since then , I &apos;ve been doing about 70 workshops around the world . With students , developers and architects , even CTOs , the Fortune 50 companies . And there &apos;s something about this task . What enables deep impressions of the nature of collaboration . And I want to share some of these with you . 
Normally , most people start orienting themselves on the task . 
They talk about it . They think about what it will look like . They &apos;re rangling for power . 
Then they invest a little time in planning and organization . They sketch and put spaghetti out . 
They spend a lot of their time in assembling . Constantly growing structures . 
And finally , Shortly before they have no more time , someone takes the Marshmallow . And they gently put him on the top . Step back and TA @-@ DA . Admire your work . 
But what happens then almost always is that TA @-@ DA becomes an UH @-@ Oh , because the weight of the marshmallow causes the whole thing to bend and collapse . 
There are a number of people who have much more UH @-@ Oh moments than others . And among the worst are freshest BWL graduates . 
They lie , they cheat . They &apos;re confused and they really produce poor shapes . 
And of course there are teams that have much more TA @-@ DA formations . And among the best are freshness graduates of the kindergarten . 
And that &apos;s quite amazing , like us . 
Peter told us , &quot; Not only do they produce the highest towers , but they also produce the most interesting structures of all . 
&quot; What you might be asking is , &quot; How does this come about ? &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; What about those ? 
&quot; And Peter doesn &apos;t tell . The kids spend time in this . Being the head of Spaghetti GmbH . They 
don &apos;t spend time in power struggles . 
But there &apos;s another reason , 
and that is that BWL students were trained to find a real plan . OK . 
And then realizing it , 
what happens when they put the marshmallow on top ? They don &apos;t have time anymore . And what happens ? 
It &apos;s a crisis . 
Sounds familiar . What kindergarten 
kids do differently is they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes . Successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so they have multiple opportunities to repair dilapidated prototypes . 
Constructors recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of an iterative process . 
And with every attempt , the kids get immediate feedback about what works . And what doesn &apos;t work like 
that is to work with prototypes . But let &apos;s see how different teams operate : 
The average for most is . At about 50 centimeters of BWL students , half of them are lawyers , but not much . Kindergarten kids are better than adults . 
Who &apos;s the most successful architect 
and engineer ? Fortunately . 
1M is the highest . What I &apos;ve seen 
and why ? Because they understand triangles and are self @-@ reinforcing geometric patterns . The key to building stable structures : 
CEOs are slightly above average . But here it gets interesting . 
You put an executive administrator in there . On the team , they get significantly better . 
It &apos;s incredible . You look around and you see . This team will win . You 
can predict that . Why is that ? 
Because you have special process monitoring skills . 
You run the process . You understand it 
and that team that controls and controls the work . Attention will significantly improve the performance of the team . 
Specialized skills and process skills and their combination will lead to success . 
If you have 10 teams that are typical , you get . CA : 6 : Stable structures . 
I tried something exciting . 
I thought , let &apos;s get the poker bet right away . 
So I offered a $ 10,000 prize for the winners . 
What do you think happened ? With these design students . 
What was that ? 
Result . This didn &apos;t happen . A team had a stable structure . 
If anyone had built a two @-@ inch construction , they would have the prize home . 
So it &apos;s not interesting that high betting has a strong effect . 
We repeated this exercise with the same students . 
What do you think happened ? 
Well , you understood the advantage of prototyping . 
So , from the same bad team , one of the best ones . 
They made the highest construction in the least time . 
So there are profound lessons for us about the nature of propulsion and success . 
You may ask . Why would someone actually invest time ? Creating a Marshmallow Challenge . 
The reason is , I help create digital tools and processes to help teams . Create cars , video games and visual effects . 
And what the Marshmallow Challenge does is it helps you identify hidden assumptions . 
Because frankly , every project has its own Marshmallow . The 
challenge is a shared experience . A common language or attitude to build the right prototype . 
And this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise . 
And those of you who are interested in it can be MarshmallowChallenge . 
COM : It &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the Marshmallows . 
There &apos;s a step @-@ by @-@ step guide there . 
You can find crazy examples from around the world , like people . Optimize and refiner the system . 
There are also world records . 
And the basal lesson , I think , is construction , actually , a connecting sport . Is 
it required that we all focus our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking optimally , like our emotions and our actions , in the challenge that lies ahead of us ? 
And sometimes a small prototype of this experience is . Everything it takes us from an UH @-@ Oh to a TA @-@ DA moment . 
And that can make a big difference . 
Thank you very much . 
Let &apos;s pretend we have a machine here . 
A big machine . A cool TED @-@ like machine . And that &apos;s a time machine . 
And everybody in this room has to be in . 
And you can go into the past . You can go into the future . You can &apos;t go into this one . 
And now stay . And I wonder what you would choose , because I &apos;ve been asking my friends a lot lately . And that question , and they all wanted to go into the past . 
I don &apos;t know . They wanted to go back to time before there were cars , or Twitter or America is looking for the superstar . 
I don &apos;t know . 
I &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re kind of drawn to nostalgia , to wishful thinking . 
And I understand that . 
I &apos;m not part of it . I have to say to this group , &quot; 
I don &apos;t want to go back to the past , &quot; and not because I &apos;m an adventurer . 
It &apos;s because opportunities on this planet don &apos;t go back . They go forward . 
So I want to go into this machine . And I want to go into the future . 
This is the greatest time that there has ever been on this planet . No matter what scale you &apos;re applying . Health , wealth . Mobility , opportunities , falling rates of disease . 
There has never been a time like this before . 
My great grandparents all died when they were 60 . 
My grandparents pushed this number to 70 . 
My parents are 80 on the heels . 
So there should be a nine . At the beginning of my death . 
But it &apos;s not even about people like us . Because this is a bigger thing than 
a kid born today in New Delhi can expect to live as long as the richest man on earth can . 100 years ago , 
think about it . This is an incredible fact . 
And why is this ? 
Skirts , smallpox , have killed billions of people on this planet . 
They &apos;ve reinvented Earth &apos;s demographics in a way that no war . They &apos;ve ever managed . 
They &apos;re gone . They &apos;ve disappeared . 
We &apos;ve defeated them . Puff : 
In the rich world , there are diseases that threaten millions of us just a generation ago . Hardly any diphtheria is rubbing . 
Polio knows anything . Somebody else 
knows what that is . Vaccines 
, modern medicine . Our ability to feed billions of people . These are successes of the scientific method . 
And in my view , the scientific method is to try things out . Look . Whether it works , it changes . If it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity . 
So that &apos;s the good news . 
Unfortunately , that &apos;s the good news . Because there are some other problems . And they &apos;ve been mentioned many times , 
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people in the world go hungry to bed every day . 
That number is rising , and it &apos;s rising very quickly . And that &apos;s embarrassing . 
And not just that . We &apos;ve used our imagination to thoroughly devastate this world : 
Drinking water . Urbare land , rainforests , oil . Gas . They disappear . And soon . And if we don &apos;t innovate out of this chaos , we disappear . 
So the question is , can we do that ? I think so . 
I think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food . The billions of people will feed without rape the land they live in . 
I think we can provide this world with energy that doesn &apos;t destroy it at the same time . 
I really think so . And no . This is not wishful thinking . 
But this keeps me awake at night . One of the things that keeps me awake at night . We &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as much as we &apos;ve never done before . And 
we &apos;ve never been able to use it sensibly , as we can do today . 
We &apos;re on the threshold of amazing , amazing events in many areas . And yet , I really think we &apos;re going to have to go back hundreds of 300 years before the Enlightenment to find a time when we &apos;ve been fighting progress . In which we &apos;ve been more violent about these things , on more fronts than we have now . 
People are shrouding in their faith . And so tight that you can &apos;t liberate them . 
Not even the truth will liberate them . 
And listen . Everyone has a right to their opinion , even a right to their opinion on progress . 
But you know what they don &apos;t have a right to . 
They don &apos;t have a right to their own . Facts , charges , they don &apos;t have . 
And I took a while to figure out , 
about a decade ago , I published an article about vaccines for The New Yorker , a little article . 
And I was amazed to encounter resistance . Resistance to what ended up being the most effective action in healthcare in the history of humanity . 
I didn &apos;t know what to do . So I just did what I always do . I wrote an article and I went on . 
And soon afterwards , I wrote an article about genetically modified . Food : The 
same thing , just bigger . 
People were crazy . 
So I also wrote an article about it . And I couldn &apos;t understand why people thought . That would be Frankenfood . Why ? They thought molecules were moving around in a certain way , rather than a random way , an attack on the territory of nature . 
But you know , I &apos;m doing what I &apos;m doing . I wrote the article . I went on . 
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist . 
We type , we &apos;re pouring in . We go eating . That &apos;s okay . 
But these articles worried me . And I couldn &apos;t figure out why . And finally , I found out . 
And that &apos;s because these fanatics who made me crazy were not fanatics at all . 
These were prudent people . Educated people , decent people . 
They were just like the people in this room . 
And that got me so confused . 
But then I thought , &quot; You know what ? Let &apos;s be honest . 
We &apos;ve got to a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we used to have . 
We talk about it in two ways . 
We talk about it in ironic terms . We talk about it with small quotes , about progress . Okay 
. There are reasons for that . And I think we know what reasons that are . 
We have trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself . And there &apos;s no reason why that shouldn &apos;t be like that . 
You can just name a few names . And people will understand 
Chernobyl , Bhopal , Challenger , Vioxx , weapons of mass destruction , the 2000 US presidential election . I mean , 
you know , you can choose your own list . 
There are questions and problems with the people we thought were always right . So be skeptical . 
Ask questions : Ask evidence . Ask evidence . 
Don &apos;t take evidence for granted . 
But now , if you get evidence , you have to accept that evidence . And that &apos;s not good for us . 
And I can say that for the reason that we are now living in an epidemic of fear , as I &apos;ve never seen before . And hopefully never again . 
About 12 years ago , a story was published . A terrible story that the Autism epidemic with measles , mumps and rubells associated vaccine . 
Very scary , 
upsetting , in a way . Studies were done to see if that was true , 
upward . Studies were to be done . That &apos;s a serious matter . 
The data came in . 
The data came in from the United States . England , Sweden , Canada . And they were all the same : No correlation , no connection , no connection . 
It doesn &apos;t make any difference . It doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes . We believe what we see , what we believe to see , what causes us to feel real . 
We don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents from a government agency that gives us data . And I understand that . I think we all do that . 
But you know what ? 
The result of that was catastrophic , catastrophic . 
Because of that fact , the United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is falling . 
That &apos;s scandalous . And we should be ashamed . 
It &apos;s terrible . 
What happened is that we could do that ? 
Well , I understand that . I do . 
Because does anybody have measles here ? 
Does one in the audience have a single measles ? The person who sees people die of measles 
doesn &apos;t happen very often . 
In this country , not at all . But 160,000 times in the world . Last year . 
These are many deaths from measles , 20 per hour . 
But because this hasn &apos;t happened here , we can displace it . And people like Jenny McCarthy can walk around and messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like Oprah . And Larry King preach live . And 
you can do that because they don &apos;t connect cause and correlation . 
They don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same . But almost never are the same . 
And that &apos;s something we need to learn . And that &apos;s very fast . 
This guy was a hero . Jonas Salk . 
He liberated us from one of the worst scourges of humanity : Don &apos;t worry , 
no pain , polio . Puff disappeared , the 
guy in the middle , not so much . 
His name is Paul Offit . 
He &apos;s just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a few other people . 
He can live 400 , 500,000 children a year . In the developing world , he can save 
pretty well . Not . 
Well , that &apos;s good . Apart from Paul walking around talking about vaccines and saying how valuable they are , and people should just stop complaining . 
And that &apos;s what he actually says . 
So Paul is a terrorist . 
When Paul speaks at a public hearing , he cannot say without armed guards . 
He gets calls at home because people like to tell him they know where his kids are going to school . 
And why ? Because Paul made a vaccine . 
I don &apos;t need to say that . But vaccines are essential . 
Take them away . Returning the diseases . Terrible diseases . And that &apos;s what &apos;s happening right now . 
We have measles in this country now . 
And that &apos;s getting worse . And pretty soon , kids will die of it again . Because that &apos;s just a question of numbers . 
And they will not just die of measles . 
What about polio ? Let &apos;s take that . Why not ? 
A fellow militant of mine wrote to me a few weeks ago saying , &quot; She thinks I &apos;m a little too shrill . 
Nobody has ever said that before . 
&quot; She wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against polio . Absolutely not 
fine . 
Why ? Because we don &apos;t have polio . And you know what ? 
We didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday . 
Today , I don &apos;t know . Maybe this morning , it &apos;s up . Someone in Lagos got on an airplane and is flying to Los Angeles . Right now , he &apos;s over Ohio , 
and he lands in a few hours . And he rents a car . And he comes to Long Beach . And he &apos;s going to be one of these fantastic TED dinner . And he &apos;s going to visit tonight , 
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a paralyzing disease . And we don &apos;t know . Because that &apos;s how the world works . 
Well , this is the planet we live on . Don &apos;t pretend it &apos;s not . 
We love to cover it up in lies . We love that . Do you 
all have that this morning ? 
Take your vitamins , Echinacea . A little antioxidant that helps you jump . 
I know you did that because half of Americans do that every day . 
You take the stuff . And you take alternative remedies . And it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find that they &apos;re useless . 
The data records that all the time . 
They evaporate their urine more . Never do it . 
That &apos;s okay . You like 28 billion dollars for dark . Pay urine . 
I agree with you completely . 
Dark . Urine : Dark . 
Why do we do that ? Why do we do that ? 
Well , I think I understand . We hate the pharmaceutical industry . 
We hate too strong a government . We don &apos;t have confidence in the system . 
And we shouldn &apos;t . Our healthcare system is bad . 
It &apos;s cruel to millions of people . 
It &apos;s absolutely amazing , cold and soul @-@ reeling , even to us who can afford it . 
So we &apos;re walking away from it , and where are we going ? 
We &apos;re walking into the arms of the placebo industry . 
That &apos;s great . I love the placebo industry . 
But you know , that &apos;s really a serious matter . Because the stuff is crap . And we spend billions of dollars on it . 
And I have all sorts of little props here , 
none of them : Gingko fraud , Echinacea fraud , Acai . I don &apos;t even know what that is . But we spend billions of dollars on it . It &apos;s cheating . 
And you know what ? When I say that , people scream at me and say , &quot; What cares you ? &quot; &quot; Let people do what they want . 
&quot; So they feel good . And 
you know what ? They &apos;re wrong 
because I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the Health Minister . He says , &quot; Hmm . &quot; I &apos;m not going to accept the evidence of my experts on mammography , or any cancer quack liver that wants to treat his patients with coffee intakes . 
If you go down that path where faith and magic replace evidence and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be . 
You get to Thabo Mbeki in South Africa . 
He killed 400,000 of his people because he insisted that red beds , garlic and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know they &apos;re going to be stopping AIDS . 
Hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country that &apos;s worse off than any other one of these diseases . 
Don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences . 
They have them . They always have them . 
Now , the most unwieldy epidemic we &apos;re in is this absurd battle between the advocates of genetically modified foods . And the bio @-@ elite . 
This is an idiotic debate . It has to stop . 
It &apos;s a debate about words about metaphors . 
This is ideology , not science . 
Everything we eat , every grain of rice . Every branch of parsley . Every sprouts has been changed by people . 
You know , there were no mandarin in paradise . 
There were no cantaloupe melons . There were no Christmas trees . We did all of that . 
We &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years . 
And some of it worked and some of it didn &apos;t . 
We got rid of what didn &apos;t work . 
Now we can make it more accurate . And of course , there are risks . But we can do something like vitamin A in rice . And the stuff can help millions of people prolong their lives . 
They don &apos;t want to do that . 
I have to say , I don &apos;t understand . 
We reject genetically modified food . 
Why do we do that ? 
Well , what I hear all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture . We don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing . That &apos;s wrong . 
We don &apos;t want companies to patent lives . 
We don &apos;t want companies to own seeds . 
And you know what ? My answer to all of that is 
yes . You &apos;re right . Let &apos;s fix that . 
It &apos;s true . We have a huge food problem . But that &apos;s not science . 
That &apos;s not science . 
It &apos;s quite morality , patent crab . 
You know science is not a company . 
It &apos;s not a country . 
It &apos;s not even an idea . It &apos;s a process . 
It &apos;s a process . And sometimes it works . And sometimes it doesn &apos;t . But the idea that we should not allow science to do its work because we &apos;re afraid is a real impasse . And it keeps millions of people blooming . 
You know , over the next 50 years , we will have to grow 70 percent more food . When at the moment 70 percent of 
this investment in Africa over the last 30 years has 
been shameful , shameful . 
You need that . And we &apos;re not giving it to you . 
And why genetically modified food ? 
We don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this rotten stuff , like Maniok . 
Maniok is something that &apos;s half a billion . People eat . 
It &apos;s about like a potato . 
It &apos;s just a bunch of calories . It &apos;s bad . 
It doesn &apos;t have nutrients . It doesn &apos;t have protein . And scientists are building all this right in there . 
And then people could eat this and not become blind . 
They wouldn &apos;t starve . And you know what ? 
That would be nice . It wouldn &apos;t be Chez Panisse . But it would be nice . 
And all I can say is , why do we fight this ? 
I mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why do we fight this 
because we don &apos;t want to push genes around ? 
It &apos;s not about pushing genes around . It &apos;s not about chemicals . 
It &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones . Our insistence on greater food , better food , unique food . 
It &apos;s not about Rice Krispies . It &apos;s about keeping people alive . And it &apos;s high time to understand what that means . 
Because you know what ? 
If we don &apos;t do that , if we keep going as we do . Let &apos;s be guilty of something we don &apos;t want to be guilty of , I think . High @-@ tech colonialism . 
There &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here . 
It &apos;s selfish . It &apos;s ugly . It &apos;s not worthy of us . And we really have to stop that . 
So after this incredibly fun conversation , you might want to say , &quot; Do you still want to be in ? &quot; This ridiculous time machine and going into the future 
, definitely . I definitely want that . Right now , 
it &apos;s in the present . But we have an incredible opportunity . 
We can put this time machine on everything we want . 
We can move it where we want to move it . And we will move it to where we want it to be . 
We need to have these conversations . And we need to think . But when we go into the time machine and go into the future , we will be happy to have done that . 
I know we can . And as far as I &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs now . 
Thank you . 
Thank you . When Steve Lopez is a columnist of the Los Angeles Times . One day through the streets in the center of Los Angeles , he heard wonderful music . 
She came from a man , an African @-@ American , sympathetic , rough , homeless , who was playing on a violin that had only two strings left . 
Many of you will know the story . Because from Steve &apos;s article about it , later on , a book that was filmed again with Robert Downey Junior . When Steve Lopez and Jamie Foxx , when Nathaniel Anthony Ayers , the contrabass player who studied at the Juilliard Conservatory , tragically ended his promising career early on with paranoid schizophrenia . 
Nathaniel left Juilliard , suffered a nervous breakdown , and 30 years later he lived on the streets of Skid Row in the center of Los Angeles as homeless . 
I recommend you read all Steves &apos; book or watch the movie so that you not only understand the wonderful interconnectedness that exists between these two men , but also how music , this connection , helped to make . And how it was , after all , the instrument when this play of words is allowed . That helped Nathaniel get off the street . 
I met Mr. Ayers . In 2008 , two years ago , at Walt Disney Concert Hall . 
He just had a demonstration of Beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and he came behind the stage to imagine myself . 
He spoke in a very cheerful and sociable tone about yo @-@ yo . MA : And Hillary Clinton , and about how the Dodgers never would make it into the Baseball World Series . And all of this because of the insidious passage of the first violin in the last sentence of Beethoven . Fourth Symphony : 
We came up with the theme of speaking music , and a few days later , I got an email saying that Nathaniel was interested in violin lessons with me . 
I have to mention that Nathaniel refused medical treatment , because he was already with electric shocks . And he was treated with thorazine and handcuffs , a trauma that he had all his life . 
As a result , he &apos;s now particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases . They &apos;re sometimes so bad that they &apos;re threatening to tear him apart . And he &apos;s disappearing for days in the streets of Skid Row wandering around . Always , exposed to this horror and the torture torment of his own mind . 
And in exactly such a charming stage , Nathaniel was when we were in the Walt Disney Concert Hall with our first lesson . He had this crazy flickering in his eyes and he was totally lost . 
He talked about invisible demons and smoke and about how someone wanted to poison him in his sleep . 
I was afraid not for me , but I was afraid I could lose him , that he could sink into one of his states , and that I could destroy his relationship with the violin . When I started talking about clay ladders and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin education . 
So I just started playing . 
I played the first movement of Beethoven &apos;s violin concerto . 
And as I played , I noticed that in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes , there was a complete change . 
It was as if he was under the influence of an invisible doctor . A chemical reaction , the catalyst of which was my game , 
Nathaniel &apos;s maniac anger , turned into understanding , into a calm curiosity and grace . 
And as if by a miracle , he took his violin and began to listen . Some excerpts of violin concerts , and then asked me to finish playing them . Mendelssohn Chaikovsky , Sibelius . 
And we started talking about music . From Bach to Beethoven , Brahms , Bruckner and all the other BS from Bartók to Esa @-@ Pekka Salonen . 
And I realized that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but he also had a close personal relationship with it . 
He talked about her with a passion and an understanding that I usually only talk about my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic by 
playing music and talking about music , and he was . This paranoid , confused man who was just pulled through the streets of Los Angeles , a kind , educated , excellent musician trained in Juilliard . 
Music is medicine . Music changes us 
for Nathaniel . Does music mean mental health 
? Because music allows him to use his imagination and creativity to create something real , his thoughts and delusions . 
And so he escapes his tormenting state . 
I understood that this is the essence of art . 
Exactly . This is why we make music so that we can do something deep inside of us all . Our emotions through our artistic lens , through our creativity , can shape into reality . 
And the reality of that expression reaches us all , and moves , inspires and unites us . 
What Nathaniel was doing , the music brought him back to a community of friends , 
the redeeming power of music brought him back to a family of musicians . They understood him who recognized his talent and respected him . 
And I will play with Nathaniel again and again . Whether in Walt Disney Concert Hall or in Skid Row , because he reminds me why I became a musician . 
Thank you very much . 
Bruno Giussani : Thank you very much . Thank you . 
Robert Gupta : 
Robert Gupta . I want to play something that I shamefully stolen from the cellist . 
I hope you will forgive me . 
I &apos;m Jane McGonigal . I design computer games . 
I &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years now . And my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy . Save the world in reality as you save in online games . 
I have a plan for that . I want to convince more people , including all of you , to spend more time playing bigger and more amazing games . 
We &apos;re currently spending three billion hours a week playing online . 
Some of you may think so . This is a lot of time for games . 
Maybe a little too much time . If you think about how many problems we urgently have to solve in the real world . In 
fact , according to my research at the Institute for the Future , that &apos;s exactly the opposite . Right ? 
Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the world &apos;s most pressing problems . 
In fact , I am convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to dramatically increase that time . 
I calculated that the time needed is 21 billion hours of playing time . That &apos;s 
per week . That seems a little bit absurd first , maybe . So I &apos;ll repeat it with that . It can work if we can solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , I think we need to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours per week by the end of the next decade . 
No . I mean , it &apos;s really serious . 
Why ? This 
picture quite accurately describes why . I think games are so vital to the survival of the human species in the future . Serious . 
This is a portrait of the photographer . Phil Toledano . 
He wanted to capture the feelings of playing . So he built a camera in front of the players . This is one 
of the classic expressions . 
When playing when you &apos;re not a player , you may miss them . Some of the nuances in this picture . 
You probably see this sense of urgency , some fear , but also extreme concentration , deeply deepened in solving a really difficult problem . 
If you play , you see some nuances . Here are the upward @-@ drawn eyes . And the mouth is a sign of optimism . The eyebrows show surprise . 
This is a player on the edge of what &apos;s called an epic victory . 
Oh , you know that . 
OK . Great . So we have some players here , 
an epic . Victory is a result that &apos;s so extraordinarily positive that you didn &apos;t even know before that it was possible at all . 
It was almost beyond imagination . And if you get there , you &apos;re shocked that you &apos;re actually capable of doing 
that . This is an epical victory . 
This player is about to win an epic victory . 
And this is what we &apos;re seeing on millions of faces of problem solvers around the world . If we &apos;re going to tackle the hurdles of the next century , the face of those who are on the edge of an epic victory , contrary to all odds . 
Well , unfortunately , we &apos;re seeing this face in real life . If we &apos;re going to face difficult problems , 
I call it &quot; being in life . &quot; I &apos;m bad face , 
and it &apos;s actually my face . Look , yeah . OK . 
That &apos;s me . How I &apos;m in life ? Am I bad ? Face making . 
This is a graffiti in my former home country , Berkeley . California , where I studied in my Ph.D. thesis why we &apos;re better at playing than in real life . 
This is a problem . This is a problem that many players have . 
We think that in reality we &apos;re not as good as playing . And 
I mean , not only less successful , although that &apos;s part of it . 
We &apos;re getting more in play worlds . 
I mean , good at motivating us to do something meaningful . Inspired at working with each other . 
If we &apos;re in a game world , I think many of us are turning into our best version , always and immediately ready to help , persistent . The problem to solve is to try to do it again as long as necessary after the failure . 
And in reality , if we fail , if we encounter obstacles , we often feel different . 
We feel overwhelmed . We feel defeated . We feel threatened . Maybe depressed , frustrated or cynical . 
We never have those feelings . If we play games in games , they just don &apos;t exist . 
And that &apos;s what I wanted to study as a PhD student . 
Why is it impossible to think in games ? You couldn &apos;t just achieve everything . 
How can we put those feelings from games into reality ? 
So I looked at games like World of Warcraft , which is the ideal environment for solving problems together . 
And I noticed a few things . Making the epic victories in online worlds as possible . 
So first of all , when you step into one of these online games , especially at World of Warcraft , there are a lot of different characters willing to entrust them with a world saving mission . And that immediately . 
But not just any mission , but a mission that is perfect for your current level . In the game , it fits 
right . So you do it . 
You never get a task that you can &apos;t solve . 
But always on the edge of your skills , so you have to make an effort . 
But there &apos;s no unemployment in World of Warcraft . You &apos;re not sitting around and turning around demons . There &apos;s always something very important to do . And 
there are , in a way , 
employees wherever they go . Hundreds of thousands of people working with them to complete their epic mission . 
We don &apos;t have that easy in real life . This feeling that , when you have fingerprints , you have staff who are willing to do it in ways , 
and there &apos;s this epic story . This inspiring story : Why are we there ? And what we have to do is we get all this positive feedback . 
You &apos;ve certainly heard about level up and level 1 , strength , or intelligence . 
This constant feedback is not in real life . 
When I leave this stage , I don &apos;t have 1 , speak and 1 crazy idea . 20 crazy idea . 
I get in real life . 
This feedback , not . So the problem with online collaboration worlds like World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying . Being on the brink of an epic victory at any time , that we prefer to spend all our time in these game worlds . 
They &apos;re just better than reality . 
To date , all World of Warcraft players have in common . 5.93 million years have spent solving the virtual problems of Azeroth . 
That &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing . 
It may sound bad . 
But to look at it in context , 5.93 million years ago , it started . Our first primate ancestors were going upright . 
The first upright primacy . 
So OK . So when we talk about how much time we spend playing at the moment . Does that make sense ? When do you spend time on the scale of human development ? What &apos;s extraordinary , 
but also appropriate . Because it turns out that by going on playing all this time , we actually change that . What are we human beings capable of ? We develop into 
community . Thinking , heartfelt beings . That &apos;s the truth . 
That &apos;s what I believe . 
Take a look at these interesting statistics that a recent researcher at Carnegie Mellon University published . The average young person today in a country with a strong playing culture spends . 10,000 hours playing online until the age of 21 . 
So 10,000 . Hours is a very interesting number . For two reasons : 
First of all , for children in the United States . 10,080 hours , the exact total time they spend in school , from fifth grade to the end of high school . If you never miss it , 
so here &apos;s a complete parallel education path . In which young people learn the same thing that it means . Being a good player , like anything else they learn in school . And maybe 
some of you have the new book by Malcolm Gladwell . Overflying people , so you know his theory of success . The theory of success of 10,000 hours . 
It &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science that if we spend 10,000 hours studying any subject with the laborious work of any subject until the age of 21 , we will master . In that , 
we will be so good at it . Whatever to do , like the most important people in the world . 
So what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are master players . 
So the big question is , what ? Are players masterfully good ? Because 
if we could figure out that out , we would have virtually never before had any human potential at our disposal . 
So many people in the world now have the ability to play online for at least an hour a day . 
These are our master players . 500 million people who are exceptionally good at something . 
And over the next decade , we have another billion players who are exceptionally good at whatever . 
If you haven &apos;t heard it yet , 
the game industry is developing consoles . Save energy and work on mobile networks , rather than broadband Internet . So players around the world , especially in India . China , Brazil , playing online , 
you can expect an additional billion players . In the next decade . 
So we have a total of 1.5 billion players . 
So I started thinking about what it is , what these games are going to do to us . 
Here are the four things I found . First , urgency optimism . 
OK , imagine this as extreme self @-@ motivation . 
Primary optimism is desire to do something right away . Mastering a hurdle , along with believing that we have a reasonable hope of success . 
Players always believe that an epical victory is possible and that it &apos;s always worth trying , and that &apos;s the 
same : Players don &apos;t sit around . 
Players are masters . In spiders , poets of social networks . 
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research . They show that we like people more . After we played with them , even if they beat us badly . 
The reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play a game with someone . 
We trust that somebody spends time with us , that the rules are being respected . That we have the same goal and stay with them until the end of the game . 
So that allows for interaction . The growth of ties , trust and interconnectedness as 
a result . We build stronger social relationships , happy 
productivity . Fantastic . 
You know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of warcraft player plays 22 hours a week . So , part @-@ time job . 
The reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier working hard . As if we relax or do nothing , 
we know that we work optimally as human beings . When we do hard , significant work , 
and players are always ready to work hard . When they get the right job , 
and eventually epic meaning , 
players love it as part of awe , more awe . Missions of planetary proportions . 
Here &apos;s a background information to put that in perspective . You probably know all Wikipedia . The biggest Wiki in the world . The 
second largest Wiki in the world , with almost 80,000 entries , is : The World of Warcraft @ Wiki 
Five Millions of people . Use it everybody . Monthly . 
You have more information about World of Warcraft online than about any other topic . In any other Wiki in the world , 
you &apos;re creating an epic story . 
You &apos;re creating an epic source of knowledge about the World of Warcraft . 
OK . So these are four superpowers that lead to a single result . Players are super @-@ powerful , hopeful individuals . 
They &apos;re people who believe that as individuals they can change the world . 
And the only problem is they believe . They can change the virtual worlds , but not the real ones . 
That &apos;s the problem I &apos;m trying to solve . 
Edward Castronova is a scientist . 
His work is awesome . 
He &apos;s studying why people spend so much time , energy and money on online worlds . 
And he says , &quot; We are witnessing no less than mass emigration to virtual worlds and online gaming environments . &quot; 
And this is from an economist . So he &apos;s logical . 
And he &apos;s not saying the way I do . I &apos;m developing games . I &apos;m a little bit exuberant . 
So he says , &quot; That actually makes sense . &quot; Because players can do more in online worlds than in real life . 
They can build stronger social ties in games than in real life . They get more feedback and rewards in games . So than in real life , 
so he says , &quot; It &apos;s perfectly logical right now that players have more time in the virtual world than in real life . 
&quot; I agree with that . That &apos;s logical . 
But it &apos;s definitely . It &apos;s not an optimal situation . 
We have to start turning the real world into a game . 
My inspiration comes from an event . It &apos;s 2,500 years back . 
There are these ancient cubes of sheep &apos;s cocks . 
You know , in front of these fantastic game econtrollers , there were sheep &apos;s cocks . 
And these were , so to speak , the first game tools developed by humans . And if you look at the works of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus , you know ? You might know this story ? The story about how and why games were invented , according to 
Herodotus , became . Games , more precisely craps , invented in the kingdom of Lydia during famine . 
There was supposedly such a great famine that the king of Lydia decided to become a crazy idea . 
People suffered , people fought . 
It was an extreme situation . It took an extreme solution . 
So , according to Herodotus , they invented the craps and agreed a national strategy . In one day , you would eat . The next day you would play . 
And they would be so deeply immersed in the craps . Because games are so fascinating and surrounded by satisfying , happy productivity that they would forget that there was nothing to eat . 
And then the next day you would play . And the next day you would eat . 
And according to Herodotus , they survived for 18 years . This famine by eating one day and playing the next . 
So I think we &apos;re going to start playing games today . 
We &apos;re going to play games to escape the suffering of the real world . We &apos;re going to play games to escape everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world . Everything that &apos;s not satisfying in real life . And we &apos;re going to get what we need . From the games . 
But that doesn &apos;t have to be the end . 
That &apos;s the exciting thing . 
According to Herodotus , after 18 years of famine , it wasn &apos;t getting any better . So the king decided to start a final dice game . 
They divided the kingdom into two halves . 
They played a dice game . And the winners were allowed to break into an epic adventure . 
They left lydia and they went looking for a new home . They just left as many people as there were food to survive and they were looking for a place with the rest to thrive . 
That sounds crazy , right ? 
But the latest DNA evidence shows that the Etruscans who later formed the Roman Empire . The same DNA as the ancient Lydians . 
So scientists recently came to the conclusion that herodotus &apos;s crazy story is actually true . 
And geologists found evidence of global cooling that lasted almost 20 years , which could explain famine . 
So this crazy story could be true . Maybe 
they actually saved their people by playing by logging into games for 18 years . And then they had this inspiration and learned so much about playing with each other that they saved the whole civilization . 
So we can . 
We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft since 1994 . 
This was the first real @-@ time strategy game . The World of Warcraft series . 
This was 16 years ago . 
They played craps for 18 years . We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft for 16 years . 
I &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game . 
So they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world . So I take my 21 billion hours of play a week . 
We should agree that half of us have an hour of play a day . Until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world . 
I know you &apos;re going to ask . How do we solve problems of the real world in games ? And 
that &apos;s exactly the question I &apos;ve got my work on . In recent years at the Institute for the Future , 
we &apos;ve been dedicating this banner to our office in Palo Alto . It expresses how we should understand the future . 
We don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before 
we want to do what we want is to create the future . 
We want to imagine the best possible outcome . And then empower people to turn that idea into reality . 
We imagine epic victories and give people the opportunity to reach them . 
I &apos;ll show you very briefly three games that I &apos;ve designed to try and try to make people epic victories in their own future . 
This is &quot; World without Oil . 
&quot; The game is from 2007 . 
It &apos;s an online game where you have to overcome an oil shortage . 
Oil shortages are invented . But we have enough online content to make it realistic for you and your real life . In fact , without oil , live . So if you sign up for the game , tell us where you live . And then you get real @-@ time news films showing you how much oil costs , what it doesn &apos;t exist . How food supplies are affected , 
how transportation is affected , whether schools are closed . Whether there are riots . And you have to figure out how to shape your real life . If it were true , and we ask you to blog about it , to hire videos or photos . 
We have this game tested with 1,700 players in 2007 . And we &apos;ve been accompanying them for the last three years . 
And I can tell you , it was a changing experience . 
Nobody wants to change their lives because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should . 
But if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and you &apos;re told , &quot; Get us going . &quot; &quot; Oil out . 
&quot; This is a fascinating adventure you &apos;re going to go on . 
Find out how you would survive . Most of our players have learned from the game . Habits have kept in place , 
so we &apos;ve got to play the next world saving game . We &apos;ve set a bigger , higher goal than just oil shortages . 
We &apos;ve got the Superstruct game at the Institute for the Future . 
The starting point is to calculate a supercomputer that people will only have 23 years left on the planet . 
This supercomputer is called Global Dignition . Of course , awareness system , 
the call to players to sign up . Have we almost designed a Jerry Bruckheimer movie ? 
You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies , where there &apos;s the dream team . You have the astronaut , the scientist , the ex @-@ Sträfling , and only together can you save the world . 
But in our game , instead of just five people , we say , &quot; Everyone is on the dream team . &quot; And it &apos;s our job to build the future for energy , food , health , safety and the future of social justice . 
8,000 players played the game . For eight weeks . 
They found 500 . Incredible . Creative solutions that they can read . If you Google Superstruct and 
the last game , we &apos;ll release on March 3rd . It &apos;s a game in collaboration with the World Bank . 
When you complete the game , you get the World Bank Award for Social Reformer 2010 . 
We work with universities all over Sub @-@ Saharan Africa and invite you to learn how to redesign socially . 
We have a comic book on this . We have levels high for regional understanding . Knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and ingenuity . 
I want to invite you all to share this game with young people . All over the world , especially in developing areas that benefit from imagining together their own social ventures to save the world . 
So I &apos;m going to finish . 
I want to ask you something : 
What do you think is happening ? Next , 
we have all these fantastic players . We have games that show us what we can do . But we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet . 
Well , I hope you agree with me that players are human resources that we use to work in real life , and that games matter a lot about change . 
We have all these superpowers , happy productivity . The ability to build tight social networks , urgency optimism . And the desire for epiepical meaning . 
I really hope that together we play important games . To survive another century on this planet , and I 
hope you will design such games and play with me . 
When I look forward to the next decade , I &apos;m sure about two things : That we can create every imaginable future , and that we can play all kinds of games . So I say , &quot; Let &apos;s play the world @-@ changing games . 
&quot; Let &apos;s start . 
Thank you . I &apos;ve been interested in Placebo for some time . It may seem strange that a magician is interested in it . Unless you look at it like me , it &apos;s a deception that becomes something real . If someone just believes it hard enough , 
in other words , have sugar pills . In some studies , a measurable effect has been the placebo effect , just because the person thinks what happens to her is . A pharmaceutical or some kind of pain management . For example , if the patient believes it hard enough , there &apos;s a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect . 
A deception becomes something real because somebody perceives it so 
that we want to understand each other , I want to give you a basic , very simple magic trick . 
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . This is a trick that has been in every children &apos;s magic book since at least the 1950s . 
I myself have it from the Cub Scout Magic . The scout in the 1970s . 
I &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it . 
And then I &apos;m going to explain why I explain it . 
So you see what happens . 
The knife you can study . My hand you can study . 
I &apos;m just going to do the knife like this . In my fist , I &apos;m 
going to push my sleeves back . 
And to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeves or comes out of it , I &apos;m just going to make my wrist . Right here , 
squeeze it together in this way . You can see that at no time is anything moving . As long as I &apos;m pressurizing here , nothing can go in my sleeves or come out . 
And the goal is quite simple . 
I &apos;m going to open my hand . And hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife is held by my bare physical magnetism . 
It &apos;s actually so firmly in its place that I can shake it without the knife falling down , nothing moves 
in my sleeves , or comes out , no trickery . And you can study everything , 
TA @-@ DA . 
Now , this is a trick that I often teach small kids who are interested in magic . Because you can learn a lot about deception . If you look more closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick to do . 
I think many of you here in the room probably know . This trick , it works . 
Here &apos;s how it works . 
I hold the knife . In my hand . 
I say I close my wrist to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeve or comes out . And that &apos;s a lie . 
The reason I tie my wrist is because it &apos;s the real secret of illusion . 
The moment I turn my hand away from you so you see it moving from behind . This finger , my index finger , just moves from where it was to a position where it &apos;s stretched out like this . 
Great trick : 
There &apos;s somebody sitting behind there who didn &apos;t have a childhood . 
So he &apos;s right here . 
And when I turn around , the finger changes its position , 
and now you could talk about it . Why ? One deception is why you don &apos;t realize that there are only three fingers down here . Because the mind and the way it processes information doesn &apos;t count them individually . One , two , three , but it sees them as a group . 
But that &apos;s not really what this is about now . And then I open my hand . 
Of course , it &apos;s captured there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but by a trick , by my index finger , which is there now . 
And when I close my hand , the same thing happens by turning back . And by this movement , it &apos;s hidden that the finger is moving back . 
I take this hand away . And here &apos;s the knife . 
This trick you can show to your friends and neighbors . Thank you . 
Now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ? 
A year ago or so , I read a study that really cut me around . 
I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher . And so for me , this was an amazing thing . Because 
it turned out this is : If you offer a placebo in the form of a white pill in the form . An aspirin tablet is just a round white . Pill that has a certain measurable effect . 
But if you give the shape in which you give the placebo , for example , to a smaller pill , change it . And color this blue and paint a letter on it , it &apos;s actually measurably more effective . 
And that , though none of them are any pharmaceutical . They &apos;re just sugar pills . 
But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill , 
which really made me flick out . 
But it turned out that &apos;s not all of that . 
If you take capsules , they &apos;re even more effective than tablets . Any shape , 
a colored capsule , yellow at one end . And red at the other end is better than a white capsule . 
Dosage also plays a role . 
A pill twice . Every day , it &apos;s not as good as three pills . I can &apos;t remember the exact statistics now . Sorry . 
But the key thing is that 
doses also play a role , 
and the shape plays a role . 
And if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to grab the needle . 
Right ? A syringe with an ineffective one . A few milliliters of an ineffective substance that you inject into a patient . 
This creates a very strong image in your head . This is much stronger than a white pill . 
This graph is really . I &apos;m going to show you another time . So if we have a projector , 
the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work so well . It &apos;s like a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle , 
and none of it has any really pharmaceutical property . It &apos;s just our belief in it that &apos;s having a stronger effect in us . 
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a magic trick . 
I take something that &apos;s obviously a deception and make it look real . 
We know from that study that you have to grab a needle if you want to get to the point . 
This is an 18 @-@ inch @-@ long needle . It &apos;s very , very sharp . And I &apos;m going to sterilize it a little bit first . 
This is really my flesh . It &apos;s not Damian &apos;s special . Breared meat . 
This is my skin . This is not a special effect from Hollywood . 
I &apos;m going to stick this needle in my skin and drive through it until it &apos;s going to get out on the other side . 
If it gets you sick , if you &apos;re easily fainted . I have a couple of friends . Last night , I showed it in the hotel room and some people I didn &apos;t know . And there &apos;s a woman almost fainthead . 
So I propose , if you &apos;re getting sick quickly , look away for the next 30 seconds . Or you know what ? I &apos;m going to do the first delicate part back here . 
You can see it in a moment . But you can also look away if you want . 
So , it &apos;s going to be right here where my meat starts . On the lower part of my arm , I &apos;m just going to make a little bit of a break . 
I &apos;m really sorry . Is it crazy ? And now , just 
. A little bit through my skin . And on the other side , just get 
out again . Now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had with the knife trick . 
About , 
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers . Or ... So I 
&apos;m going to show you . This is one , two , three , four , five . 
Well , 
I know what people think . If you see this , 
you say , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s certainly not so stupid . &quot; And it just stirs through the skin for a few minutes to entertain us . 
Well , then I &apos;ll show you . 
What does this look like ? Very good . 
Yes . I know . And people back there say , &quot; Okay . &quot; I didn &apos;t really see that . People 
in the adjoining rooms are now coming in . 
Let me show you from near . This is 
really my skin . This is not a special effect from Hollywood . 
This is my flesh . And I can turn this around . 
Sorry if you get bad . Look away . Don &apos;t look at it . The 
people in the back , or those who will see this on video at some point in the future , will say : Well , yes . That looks pretty good . Impressive . But if it were real , he would see you . Here &apos;s a hole . And there , if it was really real , it would bleed . Okay . 
Let me squeeze out a little blood for you . 
Yeah , here it is . 
Normally I would take out the needle now . 
I would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds there . 
But I think in this frame here , and with the intention of making something real out of deception , I &apos;m just going to leave the needle in there . And so , from the stage , 
we &apos;re going to go through the next few days and meet again . 
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . Thank you very much . 
So I &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life . 
I just loved two . 
This first one was more like a passionate affair . 
It was a beautiful one . Fish tasty . Good consistency , rich . Best seller . 
On the menu . 
What better fish ! It became aquaculture , according to the supposedly highest standards of sustainability . 
So you could feel comfortable selling it . 
I had a relationship with this beauty for several months . 
One day , the company &apos;s boss called and asked if I could speak at an event about the sustainability of the farm . 
Of course , I said , 
&quot; Here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem has become for our chefs . How do we keep fish on our menus ? 
Over the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the seas , how we &apos;ve been barking forests . 
It &apos;s hard to overstate destruction . 
90 percent of the big fish we love , the tuna , the curative butte , the salmon , the swordfish . They &apos;ve collapsed . 
There &apos;s almost nothing left . 
So aquaculture is likely to become bad or bad . Fish farming . It &apos;s going to be part of our future . 
A lot of arguments . On the other hand , fish farms pollute the environment . Most of you anyway . And they &apos;re inefficient . Let &apos;s take tuna . A big disadvantage . 
It &apos;s got 15 percent feed recovery . That &apos;s 15 pounds . 
Wild fish are needed to get a pound of farmed tuna , 
not taste very sustainable . 
Not very good either . 
So here was finally a company . It tried to get it right . 
I wanted to support them . 
The day before the event , I called the company &apos;s head of public relations . 
Let &apos;s call him . 
Don Don , I just said the facts . Right ? You &apos;re famous for that . Growing out in the sea so far that you don &apos;t pollute the environment 
. That &apos;s true , he said . We &apos;re so far out that the waste is distributed by our fish , not concentrated . And 
then he added . We &apos;re essentially a world of our own . 
This 2.5 to one feed recovery , he said , 
&quot; The best in the industry , 
2.5 to one , great , 2.5 . 
&quot; &quot; One , what feeds ? &quot; 
&quot; Your sustainable proteins , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Great , &quot; he said . &quot; I put up . 
&quot; And that evening , I lay in bed thinking , &quot; What the hell is a sustainable protein ? 
&quot; So the next day , just before the event , I called Don . 
I said , &quot; Don , what , for example , are sustainable ? &quot; 
Proteins . He said , &quot; He doesn &apos;t know . &quot; He &apos;s going to ask . 
Well , I telephoned a few people in the company . Nobody could give me a good answer until I finally telephoned with the leading biologist , 
let &apos;s call him also . 
Don Don , I said , &quot; What , for example , are sustainable ? &quot; 
Proteins . Well , he mentioned some algae . And some fishmeal . And then he said , &quot; Chicken pellets . &quot; 
I said , chicken pellets . He 
said , &quot; Yes . &quot; Feathers . Skin . Bone flour , remains dried and processed into food . 
I said , &quot; How much percent of your food is chicken ? &quot; 
Assuming maybe two percent ? 
&quot; Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said . 
I said , &quot; Don . &quot; &quot; What &apos;s sustainable about feeding chicken to fish ? &quot; 
There was a long break in the pipeline . And he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot; 
I fell in love with this fish . 
No . Not because I &apos;m a self @-@ righteous connoisseur and a good man . 
That &apos;s me . Even 
no . I really fell in love with this fish because I swear to God , the fish tasted chicken after 
this conversation . This second fish . This is another kind of love story . 
It &apos;s the romantic species , the way you ever know your fish . Do you learn to love the fish the more ? 
I first ate it in a restaurant in southern Spain . 
A friend journalist had long talked about this fish . 
She kind of cuffed us . 
He came on the table with a bright one . Almost shimmering white color . 
The cook had cooked it . 
Hold twice . 
Amazingly , he was still delicious . 
Who can make a fish ? So good taste after it was cooked . 
I can &apos;t . But this guy can . 
Let &apos;s call it . Miguel . In fact , he &apos;s called Miguel . 
And no . He didn &apos;t cook the fish . And he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that they do . And I understand from this 
: He &apos;s a biologist at Veta La Palma . 
This is a fish rearing in the southwest corner of Spain . 
It &apos;s near the mouth of the river Guadalquivir , 
until the 1980s . The farm in the hands of Argentines . 
They grew meat cattle on what were basically wetlands . 
They did this by draining the land . 
They built this complicated sequence of canals , and they pushed water out of the country and out into the river . 
Now , they couldn &apos;t make it work . It wasn &apos;t economically 
and ecologically viable . It was a disaster . 
It killed about 90 percent of the birds , which is a lot of birds for this place . 
And so in 1982 , a Spanish company with environmental awareness bought the land . 
What did they do ? 
They reversed the river of water . 
They literally relaid the lever . 
Instead of pushing out the water , they used the channels . They used to pull the water back in . 
They flooded the channels . 
They created an 11,000 acres of fish rearing : Perch , sea ash , shrimp , eel . And in doing so , Miguel and his company completely reverse the ecological destruction . 
The farm is incredible . 
I mean , they &apos;ve never seen anything like this before . 
They &apos;re staring out onto the horizon a million miles away . And all you see are flooded canals . And this dense , lush march . 
I was there , not long ago , with Miguel . 
He &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts : Charles Darwin , and one part : A crocodile for kissing . 
Okay . There we were , and we fought through wetlands . And I chastise . And sweat has mud up to my knees . And Miguel keeps calm . A biology lecture . 
Here he highlights a rare track . 
Now he mentions the mineral needs of phytoplankton . 
And here . Here he sees a pattern of bundles reminiscent of Tanzanian giraffe . 
It turns out Miguel has spent most of his career in Mikumi National Park in Africa . 
I asked him how he has become such a fish expert . 
He said , &quot; Fish , I don &apos;t know about fish . 
I &apos;m an expert in relationships . And 
then he goes and falls into more talk of rare birds and algae and strange aquatic plants , 
and don &apos;t get me wrong . &quot; That was really fascinating . You know , the biotic community , unplugged . So , in the way 
it &apos;s great . But I was in love . 
And my head got weak over this boiled piece of delicious fish that I had on the eve . 
So I interrupted it . I said , Miguel . How does it come that your fish tastes so good ? He 
pointed to the algae . 
I know boy , the algae of phytoplankton , the relationships . That &apos;s incredible . 
But what do your fish eat ? 
How is the feed recovery ? Well 
, he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild . 
The plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton . That &apos;s what the fish feed . 
The system is so healthy . It &apos;s completely self @-@ explanatory . 
There &apos;s no food . 
Ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals . 
Later that day , I drove around on this plot with Miguel . And I asked him . I said , &quot; For a place that seems so natural , unlike any farm I &apos;d ever been on . How do you measure success ? &quot; 
At that moment , it was as if a film director had asked for a stage change . 
And we were bowing around the corner , and we had the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of pink flamingos . A literally pink carpet . As far as the eye can see . 
That &apos;s success . He said . 
Look at her bellies . Pink . 
They &apos;re smuggling , smuggling 
. I was completely confused . 
I said Miguel . Don &apos;t mess your . Fish . 
Yes . He said , 
We lose 20 percent of our fish . And fish eggs to birds . 
Now , last year , on this plot , 600,000 birds were more than 250 different species . 
It &apos;s the largest one today . And one of the most important private bird reserves in Europe . 
I said , Miguel is a good thing . Fourishing bird population , not . The last one you want to have on a fish rearing , 
he shook his head . No . 
He said , &quot; We &apos;re building extensively , not intensive . 
&quot; This is an ecological network . 
The flamingos eat the shrimps , 
the shrimps eat the phytoplankton . 
So the closer the belly , the better the system . Okay 
. Let &apos;s think about this . A farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals . And a farm that measures its success in the health of its predators , 
a fish rearing , but also a bird reserve . 
Oh , and by the way , these flamingos shouldn &apos;t even be there from the outset . 
They breed in a city 240 kilometers away , where the soil is better . For nest maintenance 
every morning , they fly 240 kilometers to the farm , 
and every night they fly . They fly 240 kilometers back . 
They do that because they follow the white line that &apos;s been crowned on the A92 highway . 
Seriously . 
I had imagined a kind of penguins journey . So I looked at Miguel . 
I said Miguel . Fly 240 kilometers to the farm and fly them . Then 240 kilometers back . In the 
evening , they do that for the kids . He 
looked at me as if I had just quoted a song by Whitney Houston . 
He said , &quot; No . &quot; They do that because the food is better . 
I didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish . It was delicious , and I don &apos;t like the skin of fish . I don &apos;t like it sucked . I don &apos;t like it crispy . 
It &apos;s this biting , charred taste . 
I almost never cook with it . And 
yet , when I tried it in this restaurant in southern Spain , it didn &apos;t taste for fish skin at all . 
It tasted sweet and pure as if you were taking a bite from the ocean . 
I mentioned that to Miguel . And he nodded . 
He said , &quot; The skin looks like a sponge . 
&quot; It &apos;s the last defense before anything enters the body . 
It evolved over the course of evolution to suck up impurities . And 
then he added , &quot; But our water has no impurities . Okay 
. A farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish . A farm that measures its success in the success of its predators . 
&quot; And then I realized when he said , &quot; A farm that doesn &apos;t have impurities , it undermines enormously . &quot; Because the water that flows through this farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River . 
It &apos;s a river that carries all the things that rivers tend to do with them today , and it &apos;s a river that leads all the things with it . Chemical pollutants , pesticide outflow . 
And when it &apos;s fought through the system and it leaves , the water is cleaner than it &apos;s come in . 
The system is so healthy . So it &apos;s 
not just cleaning a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals . It &apos;s not just a farm that measures its success in the health of its predators , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water treatment plant . And not only for these fish , but also for you and me . 
Because when the water flows out , it sinks into the Atlantic , 
a drop in the ocean . I know , but I take it . And you should do that . Because this love story , however romantic , is also instructive . 
You could say it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food . Whether we &apos;re talking about beef or meat cattle , 
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , of one in which food is . In fact , taste good . 
But for many people , it &apos;s a little too radical . 
We &apos;re not realists . We enjoy . We &apos;re lovers . 
We love weekly markets . We love small family farms . We talk about regional food . We eat organic . 
And if you say that &apos;s the things that insure the future of good food . Does anybody stand up somewhere and say , &quot; Hey guys , I love pink flamingos . &quot; But how are you going to feed the world ? How 
are you going to feed the world ? 
Can I be honest . 
I like this question . Not . 
No . Not because we &apos;re already producing enough calories to feed the world more than just feed the world . 
A billion people will starve today . 
A billion . That &apos;s more than ever before . Because of stark inequalities in distribution , not total production . 
Now , I don &apos;t like this question because it &apos;s the logic of our food system that has been going on for the last 50 years . 
Feed grain to plant @-@ eating pesticides , monocultures , chemicals to the Earth , chicken to fish . And all the time , the agricultural industry has just asked . If we feed more people cheaper , how terrible can that be ? That 
was the reason . It was the justification . It was the business plan of American agriculture . 
We should call it what it is . A business in liquidation . A business that quickly takes up ecological capital that allows that very production . 
That &apos;s not a business . And it &apos;s not agriculture . 
Our grain chamber is now threatened , not because of decreasing supply , but because of decreasing resources , 
not by the latest mowers and tractor inventions , but by fertile land , not by pumps , but by fresh water , not by chainsaws , but by forests and not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea . They 
want to feed the world . 
Let &apos;s start with the question . How are we going to feed ourselves , 
or better ? How can we create conditions that enable each community to feed itself ? 
To do that . Don &apos;t look at the agricultural industrial model for the future . 
It &apos;s really old . And it &apos;s done . 
Capital , chemistry and machines are on top of it . And it never really produced good food . 
Instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model . 
This is what goes back two billion years of work experience . 
Look at Miguel . Farmers like Miguel . 
Farmers who don &apos;t have worlds . For themselves , farms are . Restore them . Instead of using farms . They grow extensively . Instead of just intensive farmers , who are not just producers , but experts in relationships . 
Because they are the ones who are experts on taste . 
And if I &apos;m really honest , they &apos;re a better cook . When I ever will be , 
you know , I &apos;m right . Because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious . 
Thank you . 
I grew up with a lot of science fiction . 
In my school days , I went to school by bus . Every day , one hour per way . And my 
nose was always in a book , a science fiction book . That kidnapped my thoughts into other worlds and narratives my deep @-@ seated ones . Unspeakable curiosity satisfied . 
And that curiosity also proved to be that whenever I wasn &apos;t in school , I wandered through the woods , sampled and wandered , frogs and snakes and beetles and pond water , bringing everything home . And under the microscope , 
I looked at it , was totally . Science enthusiasts . 
You know , it was always about trying to understand the world and exploring the limits of what was possible . 
And my love of science fiction seemed to reflect in my environment . Because back in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea , 
Jacques . Cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows , which brought us animals and places and a world full of wonders that we could never have imagined before . 
So that probably fits very well with that science fiction role . 
And I was an artist . 
I could draw . I could paint , 
and because it &apos;s neither video games nor this saturation with computer @-@ generated films , nor the whole visual language in the media landscape , I had to create the images in my head . 
That &apos;s what we all had to do at the time . When we read a book as children , we took the author &apos;s description and projected it on the screen in our heads . 
My reaction to that was drawing and painting alien alien worlds , robots , spacecraft and all of that . In math class , 
I was constantly caught by the teacher , like I was hiding behind the textbook . 
So , around , creativity had to sort of get out of it . 
And something interesting happened . Because what fascinated me about Jacques Cousteaus &apos; shows was the idea of a world that we knew completely unknowingly . Here on our planet , 
I &apos;m sure I would never reach an alien world with a spaceship . That seemed pretty unlikely to me . 
But here was a world that I could actually enter . Here on Earth . And it was just as fascinating and exotic . Like all of this . What I always imagined when I read these books . 
So when I was 15 , I decided to become a diver . 
The only problem with this was that I lived in a small village in Canada , 1,000 kilometers from the next ocean . 
But I didn &apos;t let myself be discouraged by this . 
I annoyed my father until he finally found a diving school in Buffalo , New York , right on the other side of the border where we lived . 
I made my diving certificate in a pool of YMCA , right in the middle of winter in Buffalo , New York , 
the ocean . But I got a real ocean . Just two years later , when we moved to California , 
since the 40 years that have passed , I &apos;ve had about 3,000 hours underwater , and I &apos;ve been living in the ocean for a couple of years . 500 hours of that in submersible boats . 
And I &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flatter oceans , is as rich in fascinating life as we can really hardly imagine . 
Nature &apos;s imagination knows no boundaries . It &apos;s quite unlike our own miserable human imagination 
to this day . I feel deepest awe for what I see on my dives . 
And my love of the ocean continues at the same intensity as ever . And then , when I was an 
adult , I chose a profession , it was filmmaking . 
That seemed the best way to tell my inner urge to tell stories . It was to combine with my need to create images . 
As a kid , I kept drawing comic books . And so on . 
So films were the way to bring images and stories together . That fit together . 
Of course , the stories I chose were from the science fiction field : Terminator , Aliens and Abyss . At 
Abyss , I could have my preference for the underwater world . And I could 
connect diving to filmmaking . So my two passions sort 
of intertwined . Something interesting happened at Abyss to a narrative problem . In this movie , to solve , and we had to create a kind of liquid water system , we attacked computer @-@ generated animation . CG : 
What came out of this was . The first computer @-@ generated soft surface figure ever to be seen in a movie . 
The film didn &apos;t bring in any money . In fact , it just played in its production costs . But I noticed something fascinating : The audience around the world was hypnotized by the magic that 
came out of it . Arthur Clarke &apos;s law says , well , advanced technology and magic are . It &apos;s no longer possible to distinguish between them . So 
they saw something magical . 
And I found that incredibly exciting . 
And I thought , wow . It &apos;s absolutely essential to integrate that into the film world . So 
we went to Terminator 2 , my next movie , a lot further . 
Together with ILM , we created the guy there from liquid metal . The success was very much dependent on how this effect would arrive . 
And it worked . Again , we had created something magical . And the effect in the audience was the same . But we &apos;ve already got a little more money with the movie . 
Recorded from these two experiences , a whole new world had been achieved . A whole new world of creativity for filmmakers . 
So I started a company with my good friend Stan Winston , who was the best make @-@ up and creature designer at that time , called Digital Domain . 
The basic idea of this company was to start jumping over the phase of analog processes with optical printers , etc . , and to start digital productions in a moment . 
And we did that , and we did it . We did it for a while , 
and we did it for a competitive advantage . But in the mid @-@ 1990s , we realized that in the Creature and Character Design , which we actually founded , we were moving too 
slowly . I had written this piece of Avatar , which is the benchmark for visual effects and computer @-@ generated effects to be pushed up to new heights , with realistic human expressive characters made using CG . And the main characters should be all CG , and the world should be CG . 
But the benchmark was pretty much pushing back . And the people in my company told me that for the time being , we &apos;re not yet in a position to do that . 
So I shifted that , and I made this other movie about the big ship . 
This goes down to the studio , I sold that as Romeo and Juliet on a ship . It became a love movie of epic proportions . A passionate movie , secret 
. But did I actually want to be a real wreck ? The Titanic : Dive 
down . That &apos;s why I made the film . 
That &apos;s the truth . The studio didn &apos;t know that . 
But I convinced them by saying , &quot; We dive to the wreck . &quot; We film the real wreck . 
We &apos;ll show it in the opening sequence of the film . 
That &apos;s incredibly important . It &apos;s a good marketing tag . And 
I persuaded them to fund an expedition . 
Sounds crazy . But that &apos;s back to the fact that your imagination can create a reality . 
We actually created a reality six months later , where I was found in a Russian submersible , four kilometers below the surface of the North Atlantic , and I was able to see the real Titanic through a bullet . This was 
not a movie . No HD . This was real . 
So this really blew me around . 
And the preparations for this were enormous . We had to build cameras and headlights and everything . 
And I noticed how much these deep @-@ sea dive gears resembled a space mission . 
Well , they were also high @-@ tech and needed extensive planning . 
You go up into this capsule , and you float down into this dark , hostile environment where there is no hope of salvation . If you don &apos;t get it back yourself , 
and I thought , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s the same as if I were in a science fiction movie . 
&quot; That &apos;s really cool . I 
was really obsessed with exploring the deep sea . 
Anyway , from the part that has to do with curiosity and science . It was all . It was adventure . It was curiosity . It was imagination . 
And it was an experience that Hollywood could not give me . 
Because , you know , I could imagine a creature for which we could then create a visual effect . But I couldn &apos;t imagine what I would see outside the window . 
In some of the subsequent expeditions , I saw beings in thermal springs . And sometimes things I &apos;d never seen before , sometimes things that nobody had ever seen before . And for those who were science at the time we saw them , they had not 
even found words . So that really turned me around . And I wanted more . 
And so I made a slightly unusual decision : 
After the success of Titanic , I said , &quot; Okay . I want to put my main job as a filmmaker in Hollywood on ice and become full @-@ time researchers for a while . &quot; 
And then we started planning these expeditions . 
We went to Bismarck and we explored them with robotic vehicles . 
We went back to the wreck of the Titanic . 
We took small robots that we had built that were carrying out a fiberglass cable . 
Our intention was to dive in and look at the inside of the ship , which had never been done before . 
Nobody had ever explored the inside of the wreck . You had no means of doing that . So we developed the technology we needed . 
So , here &apos;s where I &apos;m sitting on the deck of the Titanic in a submersible , and I see planks that are quite similar to these boards here . And of those I know the band once played there . 
And I &apos;m flying through the aisles of the ship with 
a little robot vehicle . I &apos;m actually just using it . But my consciousness is inside the vehicle . 
It felt like I was physically inside the Titanic ship wreck . 
This was the surreal form of a déjà vu I &apos;ve ever experienced . Because before I was bogging around a corner , I always knew what would appear in the light cone of the vehicle . Because I had walked over the movie set for months when we shot the film . 
Because the set was an exact copy of the ship &apos;s blueprints . 
So that was a very strange experience . 
She made me realize this telepresence experience that you use robotic avatars like this . And so , your consciousness into the vehicle , can be moved into this other form of existence . 
It was really incredibly profound , 
and maybe a little bit of a view of what might happen in a few decades . If you have cyborg bodies to explore or do other things . In all sorts of post @-@ human future scenarios that I can imagine as a science fiction fan . 
After these expeditions , we started what we had seen down there . Really appreciate learning . For example , these deep @-@ sea equals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . These are , like , alien animals . But here on Earth . 
They live with chemosynthesis . 
They don &apos;t exist in a sunlight @-@ based system . How do we do that 
? And so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees Celsius water cloud . And 
you can &apos;t imagine they can survive there . 
At the same time , I was also very interested in space science . That was the science fiction influence again . From my childhood , 
and so I ended up with the people who are interested in space and who are involved with NASA . And sit on NASA &apos;s expert council and plan real space missions . They go to Russia , go through before the mission . The biomedical protocol , and everything around it , then fly to the International Space Station and take our 3D camera systems . 
That was fascinating . 
But in the end , it was because I took space scientists with us into the deep sea . I took them 
and I scaled them into the world . Down there , astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in such extreme situations . I took them to the sources so they could look around , take samples and test instruments , and so on . 
We did documentary films . But actually science , more specifically space science . 
So the circle between my existence as a science fiction fan , then as a child . And the realization into reality . 
And as I went on this discovery journey , I learned a lot . 
I learned a lot about science . But I also learned a lot about leadership . 
Now you probably think a director must be able to lead , be a leader like a ship captain or something . But 
I didn &apos;t understand much about leadership . Before I started these expeditions , 
because at a certain point , I had to say , &quot; What am I doing here ? 
&quot; &quot; Why am I doing this ? &quot; &quot; What &apos;s coming out of this ? &quot; 
These stupid movies don &apos;t bring us money . We &apos;re just playing 
the production costs , fame , no trace . Everybody thinks 
I &apos;m between Titanic and Avatar . I &apos;d run away and I &apos;d have the nails on a towel somewhere . I &apos;d been on the beach . 
I &apos;ve been celebrating all these movies , these documentary films , for a very small audience . 
No fame . No honor . No money . What are you doing ? 
You &apos;re doing it for the sake of the task , for the sake of the challenge , and the ocean is the most challenging environment that exists . You &apos;re doing it for the discovery . And because of the strange connection that emerges when a small group of people form a team . 
Because we have all done this with just 10 to 12 people who have worked together for years and years . Sometimes we &apos;ve been at sea for two to three months in a row . 
And in this community , you can see that the most important thing is respect that you have in front of each other because you &apos;ve done a job that you can &apos;t explain to anyone else . 
When you go back to land and say , &quot; We had to do it . &quot; The fiberglass , the sound attenuation , and all around it , all the technology and the difficulties . Human performance , when you work at sea , you just can &apos;t explain that to others . This is like policemen or soldiers who have gone through something together . And you know they can never explain it to anyone . 
There &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect . 
So when I came back to make my next movie , Avatar , I tried to apply the same leadership style , which is that you respect your team and in return deserve respect . 
And that really changed the dynamics . 
So I stood there again with a small team on unknown terrain . We turned Avatar with a new technology that had not existed before . 
Extremely exciting , 
an enormous challenge . 
And we became a real family for a period of four and a half years . 
And this changed my way of making films completely . 
There were people who thought we had really done this ocean estate well . And transported to the planet Pandora . For 
me , it was more of a principled way of doing my job . The actual process that changed as a result . 
So what can we conclude from all of this ? 
What lessons have we learned ? 
I think , first of all , curiosity . 
It &apos;s the most powerful human property . Our 
imagination is a force that can even create a reality . 
And the respect for your team is more important than all the laurels of this world come 
to me . Boy filmmakers who say , &quot; Give me a advice on how to do this . &quot; 
And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t limit you . &quot; Even one . That &apos;s what 
other people are worried about for you . Don &apos;t do it for you . Even bet not against yourself , but take risks for you . 
NASA has such a favorite sentence : Failure is not an alternative . But 
in art and exploration , failure must be an alternative . Because there it guarantees a trust advance , not 
an important undertaking , innovation . It was ever approached without risk . 
You have to be ready . Take risks like 
that . That &apos;s the idea I &apos;d like to give you . Failure is an alternative . Fear . But is not one . Thank you . 
If I want to bring you one thing closer today , it &apos;s that the whole data we consume is larger than the sum of your parts . And instead of thinking about overloading information , I want you to think about how we can use information to create patterns . And we see trends that would otherwise not have been visible . 
So what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical death chart , arranged by age . 
The program I &apos;m using here is a little experiment . 
It &apos;s called Pivot . And what I can do with Pivot is I can filter for a certain cause of death . Let &apos;s say accidents , 
and immediately I see another pattern that emerges . 
And that &apos;s because in the middle , here , people are most active . And they &apos;re most frail over here . 
We can go one step further and then rearrange the data and see that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everybody . Now , 
if we go on and sort by age , we say 40 years or younger . Let &apos;s see that accidents are even the main cause that people should be worried about . 
And anyone who &apos;s researching can see that this is particularly true for men . 
So you can see that the image of information and data in this way is very much swimming . It &apos;s a vivid graphic of information . 
And if we can do this for raw data , why not for content itself ? 
So what we have here is the cover images . Every single Sports Illustrated that has ever been printed . 
It &apos;s all here . It &apos;s all online . 
You can like to test it after my talk in your rooms . 
With Pivot , you can dive into a decade . 
You can dive into a given year . 
You can jump directly to a particular issue . 
So if I look here , I see the athletes who appear in this issue and the sports . 
I &apos;m a Lance Armstrong fan . So I click here to see what all the issues that Lance Armstrong is mentioned to me are . 
Now , if I just want to get a bigger overview , I could think , OK ? What ? If I look at everything about cycling , 
so I take a step back and expand the perspective . 
Now I see Greg Lemon . 
And so you get an idea of how , if you look through this kind of information , you zoom out more targeted , wider , more pure . You don &apos;t look for it or surf . Not just . 
You do something that &apos;s actually a little different . 
It &apos;s something in between . And we think it changes the way information can be used . 
So I want to take this idea a little bit further , with something like , what &apos;s a little crazy ? 
What we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wikipedia page and reduced it to a little summary . 
The summary contains a short overview and a symbol of the area from which it comes . 
I &apos;m just going to show the top 500 of the most popular wikipedia pages . 
But even in this narrow view , we can do a lot of things . 
Immediately , we get an idea of the issues that are most popular on Wikipedia . 
I &apos;m going to vote on the issue of government . 
Now , after I &apos;ve elected government , I realize that the categories of Wikipedia that cover most of it are Time Magazines , people of the year . 
This is really important . Because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single Wikipedia page . 
It &apos;s only to be seen . If you go back a step and look at the whole thing , 
look at a particular one . So I can then summarize this in the theme of Time Magazines . People of the Year go in and see everybody together . 
Now , if I look at all these people , I realize that the majority of them are government officials . Some of them come from science . Some of them come from economics even less . Here &apos;s my boss . And one comes from music . 
And interestingly , Bono is also a TED Prize winner . 
So we can jump and take a look at all the TED Prize winners . 
You see , we &apos;re surfing the web . The first time it &apos;s really a web , not just side by side , but much more abstract . 
And so I want to show you something else that might be a little surprise . 
I &apos;m just going to show you the New York Times website . 
Pivot , this application . I don &apos;t want to call it a browser . It &apos;s really not a browser . But you can look at websites with it . And we bring this zoom technology to every single website like this . 
So I can take a step back and jump directly to a specific section . 
That &apos;s important because you can only look at websites in this way , all the Internet history , in the same way , in the same way . 
So I can zoom in into my course , in a certain time frame . 
Here &apos;s the state of the whole demonstration that I &apos;ve kept going . 
And I can sort of see everything I &apos;ve seen so far . I can get 
back again . And when I go out and look at everything , I can rearrange my course . Maybe after my search past . Here I &apos;ve been looking for nepotistic . Here &apos;s Bing , or here &apos;s Live Labs Pivot . 
And from here I can go into the page and call it again . 
It &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again . And every time it makes the overall picture bigger than the sum of the data parts . 
Right now , in this world , we think data is a curse . 
We talk about the curse of the abundance of information . 
We talk about drowning in information . 
What if we could turn this situation around and turn the Internet upside down so that instead of always moving from one to the other , we start from many things to many things to many things . And by doing so , we can see patterns that would otherwise have been hidden . 
If we can do this , this data trap may become a new source of meaningful information . 
And instead of just moving into information . We know , get from it . 
And if we know , then maybe we can even learn wisdom from it . 
So I stop . Thank you . 
Everybody talks about happiness today . 
I have let some people count the number of books that are published with Happiness in the title over the last five years . And they stopped after about 40 . And there were many more . 
There &apos;s a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers . 
There &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching . 
Everybody would like to make people happier . 
But despite all this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps that make it almost impossible , so to speak . Sure . Thinking about happiness , 
and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps . 
This is true for laymen who think about their own happiness . And it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness because it turns out we &apos;re just as confused as anyone else . 
The first of these traps is to admit complexity . 
It turns out that the word happiness is simply no longer a useful word , because we have too many different things to apply . 
I think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could limit it to . But by and large , this is something that we need to give up . And we will need to take the complicated view . What well @-@ being is 
the second . Trap is a confusion of experience and memory . Basically , it &apos;s between happiness . In his life and being happy about his life or happy with his life . 
And these are two very different concepts . And they &apos;re both thrown together in the notion of happiness . 
And the third is the concentration illusion . And that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about one thing . Well @-@ being affects without distorting its meaning . 
I mean , this is a real cognitive trap . 
There &apos;s just no way . It &apos;s getting right . 
Now I &apos;d like to start with an example from someone who had a question and answer session . After one of my lectures , which was a story , it was unclear . He said he &apos;d heard a symphony . And it was absolutely wonderful music . And at the very end of the recording , there was a terrible , creeping sound . 
And then he added , &quot; Really , quite emotionally . That &apos;s ruined the whole experience . 
But that wasn &apos;t 
what it had ruined . &quot; Were the memories of the experience ? 
He had the experience . 
He had 20 minutes of wonderful music . 
They didn &apos;t count because he had stayed with a memory . The memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had been kept . 
What this really tells us is that we think about ourselves and about other people . In the sense of two kinds of self . 
There is a living self that lives in the present . And the present knows how to experience the past again . But basically , only the present has 
it . It &apos;s the living self that the doctor instigates . You know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Is it hurting now ? &quot; When I touch you here . And 
then there &apos;s a remembering self . And the remembering self is that that mitzählt and keeps the story of our lives upright . And it &apos;s the one the doctor addresses by asking the question . How did you feel lately ? Or 
how was your journey to Albania or something like that ? 
These are two very different entities . The living self . And the remembering self . And confusing the two is part of the coexistence of the term happiness . 
Now , the remembering self is a storyteller . 
And that really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memories . It starts immediately . 
We &apos;re not just telling stories . When we make ourselves tell stories , 
our memory tells us stories . That means that what we can keep from our experiences is a story . 
And let &apos;s start with an example . 
There &apos;s an old study . 
These are real patients who undergo a painful procedure . 
I &apos;m not going to go into detail . It &apos;s no longer painful today . But it was painful when this study was done in the 1990s . 
They were asked to report every 60 seconds about their pain . And 
here are two patients . These are their records . 
And they &apos;re asked , who has suffered more from both ? And 
this is a very simple question . 
Patient B has suffered more clearly . His intestinal reflection was longer and every minute of pain . Patient A had patient B and more . 
But now there &apos;s another question : How much did these patients think they suffered ? And 
here &apos;s a surprise . And 
the surprise is that patient A has had a much worse memory of intestinal reflection than patient B. 
The stories of intestinal reflections were different . And because a very critical part of the story is how it ends . 
And none of these stories is very edible or great . But one of them is clear . But one of them is clearly worse than the other , 
and the one that is worse was where the pain was at its peak at the very end . It &apos;s a bad story . 
How do we know that ? 
Because we asked these people about their gut reflection , and much later on , how bad was the whole thing ? And 
it was much worse for A than for B in memory . 
Well , this is a direct conflict between the living self and the remembering self . 
From the perspective of the living self , B clearly had a worse time . 
Now , what you could do with patient A ? And we actually did clinical experiments . And it was done . And it works . You could actually extend patient A &apos;s intestinal reflection by just leaving the tube inside without being too shaken on it . And 
that &apos;s going to cause the patient to suffer . But just a little bit less than before . 
And if you do that for a few minutes , you &apos;ve made the living person worse off even patient A . And you &apos;ve made the memory self of patient A much better off . Because now you have patient A better story about your experience . 
What does a story look like ? 
And that &apos;s true of the stories that memory gives us . And it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent , which are 
what makes a story special . Breaks , significant moments and ends . 
Ends are very , very important . And in this case , the end dominated . 
Now , the living self is constantly living its life . 
It has moments of experience one after the other . 
And you ask , what happens to these moments ? 
And the answer is really simple . They &apos;re lost forever . 
I mean , most moments of our lives . And I &apos;ve calculated that . You know , the psychological presence is considered for about three seconds . What does it mean ? Do you know that there are about 600 million of them in a life ? In a month , there are about 600,000 . Most of them leave no trace . 
Most of them are completely ignored by the memory self . 
And yet , somehow they get the impression that they should count that what happens during these moments of experience . Our life is 
it &apos;s the limited resource we consume while we &apos;re in this world . 
And how we consume it would seem important . But that &apos;s not the story that the memory self keeps for us . 
So we have the memory self . And the living self . And they &apos;re really quite different . 
The biggest difference between them is how to deal with time . 
From the perspective of the living . Even if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first . Then the two @-@ week holiday is twice as good as the one @-@ week holiday . 
That &apos;s not how it works at all . For the remembering self , 
for the remembering self , a two @-@ week holiday is hardly better than the one @-@ week holiday . Because there are no new memories added . 
You haven &apos;t changed the story . 
And in this way , time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from a living self , has time . Very little influence on this story . 
Now , the remembering self makes more than remembering and telling stories . 
It &apos;s actually the one . It makes decisions , because if you have a patient who , let &apos;s say , had two intestinal reflections with two different surgeons and decides which to choose . Then is the one who chooses the one who has the memory that &apos;s less bad . And that &apos;s the surgeon who will be selected . 
The living self doesn &apos;t have a voice . In this election , actually , 
we don &apos;t choose between experiences . We choose between memories of experiences . 
And even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t normally think about our future as experiences . 
We think about our future as anticipated memories . 
And basically , you can look at that . You know , as a tyranny of the memory self . And you can think of the memory self as one . That , so to speak . The living self is dragging through experiences that the living self doesn &apos;t need . 
I have the impression that when we go on vacation , it &apos;s very often the case . That means we go on vacation as far as possible in the service of the memory self . 
And that &apos;s a little hard to justify , I think . 
I mean , how much do we feed from our memories ? 
That &apos;s one of the explanations given for the dominance of the memory self . 
And when I think about that , I think about a vacation we spent a few years ago in Antarctica that is clearly the best vacation I &apos;ve ever had . And I think relatively often about how often I think about other vacations . 
And I probably have my memories of this three @-@ week journey . I would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years . 
Drilled . Now , if I &apos;d ever opened the folder with the 600 images in it , I would have spent another hour . 
Now , that &apos;s three weeks . And that &apos;s at most . One and a half hours . 
There seems to be disagreement . 
Now , I like to be a little extreme . You know , in it , how little appetite I have for feeding memories . But even if you do more of that , there &apos;s a real question . Why do we give memories so much weight in the scourge to the weight that we give experiences ? 
So I want you to think about a thought experiment . 
Imagine your next vacation . You know that at the end of your vacation , all your pictures are destroyed . And you get an amnesty drug so you don &apos;t remember anything . 
Now , you would choose the same vacation . And if you chose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two kinds of self . And you have to think about how you decide this conflict . And that &apos;s really not obvious at all . Because if you think about time , you get an answer . And if you think about memories , you could get a different answer . 
Why we choose the vacations that we choose is a problem that confronts us with a choice between the two kinds of self . 
Now , the two kinds of self throw two terms of happiness . 
There are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply : One per self . 
So you can ask , how happy is it ? The living self . 
And then you would ask , how happy are the moments in the life of the living self ? 
And you &apos;re all lucky for moments is a fairly complicated process . 
What are the emotions ? Which can be measured . 
And by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea . From happiness of the living self over time . 
If you ask about happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a very different thing . 
This is not about how happy a person lives . 
It &apos;s about how satisfied or happy . The person is very different in terms of life when 
he thinks about his life . 
Anyone who doesn &apos;t distinguish these terms is going to . Exploring happiness is going to melt . And I &apos;m a lot of researchers about well @-@ being , who have long masked the exploration of happiness . In that very way , 
the distinction between happiness of the living self . And happiness of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years . And now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separately . 
The Gallup Organization has a global survey , in which more than half a million people have been asked questions . What they think about their lives and their experiences . And there have been other efforts in the direction . 
So in recent years , we &apos;ve started to think about the happiness of the two kinds of self . 
And the main lesson we &apos;ve learned , I think , is that they &apos;re really different . 
You can know how satisfied someone is with his life . And that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happy he lives his life . And vice versa , 
just to give you an idea of the correlation . The correlation is about five percent 
, which means that if you hit someone , and you would tell them , &quot; Oh , his father is a two @-@ meter man . &quot; How much would you know about his height ? 
Well , you would know about his size . But there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty . 
You have so much uncertainty . 
If I tell you that someone has his life as eight on a scale of 10 . Do you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self ? 
So the correlation is low . 
We know something about what determines happiness self . 
We know money is very important . Targets are very important . 
We know happiness is basically about being satisfied with people we like to spend time with people we like . 
There &apos;s other pleasure . But that &apos;s dominant . 
So if you maximize happiness of the two kinds of self . Will you end up doing very different things ? 
The conclusion from what I said here is that we really don &apos;t think of happiness as a substitute for well @-@ being . 
It &apos;s a completely different term . 
Now , very briefly , another reason why we can &apos;t think clearly about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things . When we think about life , and when we actually live . 
So if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California , you won &apos;t get the right answer . 
If you ask that question , do you think that people in California need to be happier ? If you say , &quot; We live in Ohio , &quot; 
and what happens is that if you think about life in California , think about the difference between California and other places . And that difference is , say , climate . 
Well , it turns out climate doesn &apos;t matter very much to the living self . And it &apos;s not even very important to the thoughtful self . That decides how happy people are , 
but now , because the thoughtful self is responsible . Can you end up with some people moving to California at 
the end ? And it &apos;s kind of interesting to track . What happens to people moving to California in the hope of getting happier ? 
Well , their living self won &apos;t get happier . 
We know that . 
But one thing will happen . You &apos;ll think you &apos;re happier . Because if you think about it , you &apos;ll be reminded of how terrible the weather was in Ohio . And you &apos;ll feel you &apos;ve made the right decision . 
It &apos;s very difficult to think clearly about well @-@ being . And I hope I &apos;ve given you an idea of how difficult it is . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question for you . 
Thank you very much . 
Well , when we telephoned a few weeks ago , you told me that there was a pretty interesting result from this Gallup survey , which was , 
is that something you let us share in , because you &apos;re now left a few minutes . 
Daniel Kahneman : Sure . 
I think the most interesting result we found in the Gallup survey is a number that we absolutely don &apos;t expect to find . 
We found that in terms of happiness for the survivor . 
Even if we looked at how feelings vary with income , 
and it turns out that under an income of 60,000 dollars a year for Americans . And this is a very big sample of Americans . About 600,000 . But it &apos;s a big representative sample . Under an income of 600,000 dollars a year . 
About 60,000 . 
DK : 60,000 , 
60,000 dollars . In a year , people are unhappy . And they &apos;re getting increasingly unhappy . The poorer they get 
, we get an absolutely flat line about it . 
I mean , I rarely saw such flat lines . 
What happens is , obviously , money doesn &apos;t get you experience happiness . But that lack of money certainly brings you misery . And we can measure this misery very , very clearly . 
In the sense of the other self , the memory self , you get a different story . 
The more money you make , the more satisfied you are . 
That &apos;s not true of emotions . 
CA : But Danny , throughout the American endeavor , it &apos;s about life . Freedom , the aspiration for happiness . 
If people take this finding seriously , I would mean . It seems to turn everything on the head . Everything we believe , for example , in tax policy and so on , 
there &apos;s a chance that politicians , that the country in general , would take a finding like that seriously . And based on that , politics would do 
DK , you know ? I think there &apos;s recognition for the role of gambling research in politics . 
Recognition will be slow . In the United States , no question . But in the United Kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now . And in other countries , it &apos;s happening right now . 
People are recognizing that they should think about happiness . When they think about politics , 
it &apos;s going to take a while . And people will discuss whether they want to explore experience happiness or whether they want to explore life assessment . So we need to have this discussion pretty soon , 
how to increase happiness . It &apos;s very different . Depending on that . How you think ? And whether you think about the memory self , or whether you think about the living self . 
That &apos;s going to influence politics , I think , in the coming years 
in the United States . If you &apos;re tightening on the happiness of the people to experience . 
That &apos;s what I think will be part of national statistics in the next decade or two . 
CA : Well , it seems to me that this topic is going to , or should , be at least the most interesting political debate to follow . Over the next few years . 
Thank you very much . For the invention of behavioral economics . 
Thank you . Danny Kahneman : Today 
I &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate . 
And that might surprise you a little bit , because my full @-@ time work at the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds , about the things we need to invent and deliver to enable the poorest two billion to live better . 
But energy and climate are extremely important . In fact , for these people , even more important than for anyone else on the planet . 
Climate degradation means that their seeds will not grow for many years , we will rain too much or too little . Things will change as their fragile environment cannot endure . 
That leads to starvation . It leads to insecurity . It leads to unrest . 
So climate change will become terrible for them . And 
also , the energy price is very important for them . 
The fact is , if you could just reduce the price of one thing to reduce poverty , energy would be . By far the most effective . 
Well , the energy price has fallen over time . 
In fact , the progress society is based on energy progress . 
Coal evolution drove the industrial revolution . And even in the 20th century , there was a rapid fall in the electricity price . And so we have refrigerators , air conditioning . We can make modern materials . And so many things we 
do , so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world . 
But if we reduce the price , we can halve the price . Let &apos;s hit a new barrier . And this barrier is related to CO2 , 
CO2 warms the planet , and the equation for CO2 is . Actually , pretty clear . 
They sum up . The CO2 emitted , which leads to temperature increase . And this temperature increase has some very negative effects on the weather . And perhaps worse , the indirect consequence is that natural ecosystems cannot adapt to such rapid changes . And so whole systems collapse . 
Now , the exact link between a CO2 increase and the resulting temperature change , and where its further consequences lie . There are some ambiguities , but not very many . 
And there &apos;s certainly uncertainty about how bad these consequences will be . But they will be extremely bad . 
I &apos;ve asked the top scientists several times , &quot; Do we really have to get down to near zero ? 
&quot; &quot; Is not half or a quarter enough ? 
&quot; The answer is , we get close to zero . Will the temperature continue to rise ? 
So it &apos;s a big challenge . 
It &apos;s quite different from saying . We have a 3.5 @-@ meter truck that &apos;s below a three @-@ meter bridge . You have to squeeze it down , you can squeeze 
it down . This has to be down to zero . 
Now , we emit a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons . 
Every American , about 20 tons of people from poor countries , less than one on average , 
it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet . 
And somehow we have to create changes that reduce that to zero . 
It &apos;s been constantly increasing . 
Only different economic changes have affected it at all . And we have to go from rapid growth to reduction and to a reduction to zero . 
This equation has four factors : A bit of multiplication . You have this thing on the left , CO2 , that you want to get to zero . And that will depend on the number of people , on the services that every human being uses on average , the average energy for every service , and the CO2 per unit of energy . 
It &apos;s emitted . So let &apos;s look at each factor individually . And let &apos;s think about how we get that to zero . 
Probably one of these numbers has to be very close to . 
Zero . Now , this is basic algebra . But let &apos;s go through it . 
First of all , we have the population . 
Today , 6.8 billion people live 
, and it &apos;s rising to 9 billion , 
moving to 9 billion . If we succeed very successfully with new vaccines , healthcare and reproductive medicine . Could we reduce that by 10 to 15 percent ? But right now , we &apos;re seeing a 1.3 percent slope . 
The second factor is the services we use . 
That includes all the food we eat : Clothing , television , heating . 
These are very good things . And poverty reduction means that these services are accessible to almost everyone on the planet . 
It &apos;s great that this number is rising 
in the rich world , in the top billion , we might be able to make cuts and use less . But on average , this number is going to rise every year , and so it &apos;s more than doubling overall . The number of services that are provided per person . So 
here &apos;s a very basic service . Is there light at home to read the homework ? 
And these students don &apos;t have it . So they go out and read their homework under the street light . 
Now , effectiveness , the E : The energy per service , finally there &apos;s good news . 
We have something that doesn &apos;t go up . 
Because of different successes in the lighting sector , because of other types of cars , because of new methods in building houses . There are many services that you can drastically reduce their energy consumption . 103.00 , 05.50 , 000 GT , 00.05 , 53,000 . 
Some services can be reduced by 90 percent . 
Some services can be reduced by 90 percent , others can be reduced . Like the production of fertilizers 105.00 , 05.56 , 000 GT , 00.05.58 , 000 , or air transport . 
Or air transport is the scope for improvement , much smaller overall . If we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a factor 3 reduction , or maybe even a factor 6 reduction . 
But now , with the first three factors , we &apos;re from 26 billion to 26 billion . Maybe the very best 13 billion tons . And that &apos;s just not enough . 
So let &apos;s look at the fourth factor . And this will be a key factor . That &apos;s the amount of CO2 per unit of energy . 
It &apos;s emitted . It &apos;s the question of whether you can get that to zero . 
If you burn coal , no , 
if you burn natural gas , no , 
almost every method of producing electricity emits . Today , CO2 , except renewable energy and nuclear energy . 
So what we need to do at a global level is create a new system . 
We need energy under . 
Now , if I use the term &quot; miracle , &quot; I don &apos;t mean the impossible , 
the microprocessor is . A miracle , the PC is a miracle , 
the Internet , and its services are a miracle . 
People here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles . 
Normally , there &apos;s no deadline for you to need a miracle by a certain date . 
Normally , you &apos;re just standing next to it . And some don &apos;t come to others . 
But in this case , we have to give full gas . And get a miracle in a very short time . 
Well , I wondered , how can I really do that ? 
Well , there &apos;s a natural illustration , a demonstration that sparks people &apos;s idea here . 
I remembered last year . When I brought mosquitos , and somehow people liked that . 
The idea became really tangible to them . You know , there are people who live with mosquitos 
, for energy fell . I got this one . 
I decided that releasing fireflies , my contribution to the environment this year , would be here . 
So here are some natural fireflies . 
I &apos;ve been assured they &apos;re not biting . In fact , they &apos;re not even going to leave the glass . 
Well , there are all kinds of game solutions like this . But they &apos;re not all doing much . 
We need solutions , either one or more , that have unimaginable scaling and unimaginable reliability . And though there are many directions where people are looking for it , I really see only five that can make these big demands . 
I &apos;ve omitted tides , geothermal fusion and biofuels . 
These may make a moderate contribution . And if they do better than I expect , that would be great . But my key message here is that we need to work on all of those five . And we can &apos;t give up on them because they intimidate us . Because everybody has significant problems . 
Let &apos;s first look at them . Burning fossil fuels , burning either coal or natural gas . 
What you have to do there may seem simple . But that &apos;s not it . You have to take all the CO2 that comes out of the chimney after it &apos;s burned . Liquid under pressure . And then somewhere , and hope it stays there . 
There are some pilot projects that can do that at a 60 @-@ 80 level . But getting it to 100 will be very difficult . And getting an agreement on storing CO2 is a big challenge . But the biggest problem here is storing time . 
Who will make sure ? 
Who can guarantee something ? What literally is many billion times bigger than any kind of waste you get to imagine about nuclear and other things . 
That &apos;s a lot of volume . 
So that &apos;s a hard nut . 
Next , nuclear energy . 
It also has three major problems . The cost , especially in highly regulated countries , is high . The question of security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong . Despite human cooperation , that the fuel is not used for weapons . 
And then what do you do ? With the waste . 
Because although it &apos;s not very big , there are a lot of concerns . 
People have to feel good about it . 
184,00 10 20 000 GT 00 10 25 000 . So three very difficult problems that might be solvable , three very difficult problems that may be solvable . And so , you should work on those , and 
the last three of the five have . So I &apos;ll summarize . 
It &apos;s renewables . As you &apos;re often called , 
and they have , although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel . They have some disadvantages . 
One is that the energy density that these technologies generate is dramatically lower than that of power plants . 
These are low @-@ energy . You talk about many square kilometers more space than a normal power plant . 
And these sources are also subject to interruptions . 
The sun doesn &apos;t shine all day long . It doesn &apos;t shine every day either . And the wind doesn &apos;t blow all the time . 
So , if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , you have to have a way to do that , even in times . If it &apos;s not available , 
to get it . So there are big price challenges here . There are challenges in transmission . For example , if we say that the energy source is outside the country , it &apos;s not just technology that you need . You also have to deal with the risk that the energy comes from where it comes from . 
And there &apos;s the storage problem . 
And to show the dimension , I &apos;ve looked at all kinds of batteries that are made for cars , computers , cell phones , flashlights for everything . And I &apos;ve got that with the amount of electronic energy that the world uses . I found that all the batteries that we &apos;re now producing store less than 10 minutes of total energy . 
So we need a big breakthrough here , something that will be 100 percent better than the current approaches . 
It &apos;s not impossible . But it &apos;s not that easy . 
That &apos;s what happens when you try to tell these interrupted sources about . We &apos;re going to bring 20 to 30 percent of consumption . 
If you want to rely on it 100 percent , you need an incredible wonder battery . 
Now where are we going to go ? What &apos;s the right approach ? 
A Manhattan project . How do we get to the finish line ? 
What we need is a lot of companies working on it . Hundreds . 
In each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people . 
For many , you &apos;ll say , &quot; They &apos;re crazy . &quot; That &apos;s good . 
I think there are many in the TED group who are already engaged there . 
Bill Gross has several companies , including one called Esolar . The great solar thermal technologies have invested 
Vinod Khosla in dozens of companies . The great things are doing and have interesting opportunities . And I &apos;m trying to support that . 
Nathan Myhrvold and I are funding a company that maybe surprisingly has a nuclear approach . 
There are some innovations in the nuclear sector : Modular , liquid . 
Developments in this industry stopped some time ago . So it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are lying around . 
The Terrapower concept means that instead of a part of the uranium , one percent , you have the U235 . We decided to burn the 99 . The U238 . This 
is a pretty crazy idea . But 
in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time . But you could never reasonably simulate whether it would work . But since there are modern supercomputers , you can simulate it and see that , yes , with the right approach to materials , it looks like it works . 
And because you burn these 99 , the cost profile is much better . In fact , 
you burn the garbage , and you can even use the garbage of today &apos;s reactors as 
a drive . Instead of breaking your head over it , they just burn it . A great thing : 
Uranium is being used gradually , a little bit like a candle . 
You can see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often called a migratory wave , reactor . 
It really solves that . The fuel problem here 
is a picture of a place in Kentucky . 
That &apos;s the waste , the 99 percent . You have the part that &apos;s burned today . You have taken it out . So it &apos;s called depleted uranium . 
That drives U.S. for hundreds of years . 
And if you filter ocean water cheaply and easily , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet &apos;s 
life . You know , there are many challenges there . But it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward . 
Let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success 
. What should our testimony look like ? 
Well , we go to the goal that we need to achieve . And then we talk about the intermediate step . 
Many talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 . 
It &apos;s really , really important that we get there , 
the remaining 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still some agriculture . Hopefully , forest threats and cement will be clean by then . 
So to get to that 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like China , needs to completely transform their generation of electricity . 
The other note says whether we &apos;re using zero emissions technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to getting it to the 
rest . That &apos;s super important . 
That &apos;s going to be a key element of this stuff . 
If we go back from there , what should that 2020 be ? 
It should contain the two elements again . 
We should use the effectiveness measures to get reduction going . The less we emit , the less CO2 we emit . And so will the temperature . 
But actually , this note is for the things we do , which do not completely lead to the big reductions . Just equal or even a little less . Important , like the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs . 
We have to track these breakthroughs with full gas . And we can measure this in company numbers , pilot projects and regulatory changes . 
There are many great books on this subject . 
The Al Gore book . We have the choice . And David McKay &apos;s Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air . They 
really go through it and create a framework where this can be widely discussed . Because we need support from all sides for this . 
There are a lot . The coming together has 
to be a wish . 
A very concrete wish that we invent this technology . 
If you just want to allow me to do that for the next 50 years . I could choose the president , a vaccine , and I love that . Or I could choose that wish . That is halved energy price . Without CO2 , it &apos;s invented , that desire would be sewn . 
I , this one , has the greatest impact . 
If we don &apos;t get that wish , the gap between long @-@ term and short @-@ term thinking will be . People will be terrible between the United States and China , between poor and rich countries , and almost all of them will live on these two billion . A lot worse . 
So what do we have to do ? 
What action do I appeal for ? 
We have to work for more research funding . 
When countries meet in places like Koppenhagen , they should not just talk about CO2 . 
They should discuss this innovation strategy . And they would be shocked by the ridiculously low money spent on these innovative approaches . 
We need market incentives , CO2 , taxes , cap &amp; amp ; trade , something that sends a price signal . 
We need to spread the news . 
We need to have dialogue , rationality and completeness , and also the things that the government is doing . 
It &apos;s an important wish . But I think we can fulfill it . 
Thank you very much . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . Thank you . 
Thank you . Thank you very much . Just to get a little better at understanding Terrapower . First of all , you can give us an idea of the magnitude of this investment . 
Bill Gates : To do the simulation on a supercomputer . To get all the big scientists what we &apos;ve done , we just need a few 10 million . And even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a Russian reactor to make sure it works properly . Is it only in the 100 million that you 
&apos;re tough ? Step by step , building the first reactor is finding billions more . The regulations and the place that actually builds the first of them . 
Once the first is finished , when it &apos;s running as promised , then it &apos;s all very clear . Because the profitability , the energy density , is as different as we know it from 
nuclear energy . CA : To understand that correctly . That means building deep into the ground . Almost like a vertical pillar of nuclear fuel . This consumed uranium . And then the process starts at the top and continues to work . Down . 
BG : Exactly . Today , you have to refill the reactor . So there are lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong , this thing where you open it and bring things in or out . That &apos;s not good . 
But if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years . Think of a column that you bury without all the complexities . 
And it sits there and it burns for 60 years . And then it &apos;s done . 
CA : A nuclear reactor that itself provides a solution to the garbage . 
BG : Yeah . Now what happens to the garbage ? You can let it sit . There &apos;s much less garbage . With this method , then you take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it further . 
And we start by taking the garbage that already exists , which is in these cooling basins or dry tanks , at the reactors . That &apos;s our starting fuel . 
So what was a problem for these reactors ? What we do in our fill , and that &apos;s dramatically reducing the garbage volume . During this process , 
about , but while you talk to different people in the world about these possibilities . 
Where is the greatest interest ? So , to actually implement this . 
BG : Well , we haven &apos;t yet set ourselves in a place . And there &apos;s a lot of interesting disclosure rules for everything that nuclear carries in the name . There &apos;s a lot of interest , and the people of the company were in Russia , India , China . I was here and I met the energy minister and talked about how this fits into the energy agenda . 
I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the French and Japanese have made something in the direction . 
This is a variant of one thing . It was done . 
This is an important step forward . But it &apos;s like a fast reactor . And some countries have built this . So anyone who has implemented a fast reactor is a candidate for our first one . 
CA : In your imagination , timeframe and probability , to really bring this to life . 
BG : Well , we need one of these scalable , power generating things that is very cheap . We &apos;ve got 20 years to invent . And then 20 years to deploy . 
This is kind of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we need to comply with . 
And you know , Terrapower , if everything goes well . And that &apos;s a big one . Wish could keep that easy . 
And fortunately , there are dozens of companies today . And we need hundreds of them as well . If their approaches work , the promotion for their pilots works . Can offer them for that . 
And it would be best if there were several , because then you could use a mix . In any case , 
we need a solution . 
CA : So , with regard to the big , possible breakthroughs , this is the biggest thing you know . 
BG : An energy break is the most important thing . 
It would have been without the environmental challenge . But it &apos;s still doing that . More importantly , 
in the nuclear sector . Are there other innovative companies 
? You know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as they do . But there &apos;s the modular method . That &apos;s a different approach . 
There &apos;s a liquid reactor type that seems a little difficult . But maybe they say that about us . 
And so there are different ones . But the nice thing about this is that a uranium molecule has a million times as much energy as a coal molecule , let &apos;s say . And so if you can deal with the problems , and these are mainly radiation , footprint , and the cost is playing the potential . So the impact on the country and other things , almost in a league of its own . 
CA : If that doesn &apos;t work , what 
do we have to do then is take emergency measures to try and keep the Earth temperature stable ? 
BG : When you get into this situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;ve eaten too much . And you &apos;re about to have a heart attack , what do you do ? You might need a heart surgery or something like that . 
There &apos;s a research that &apos;s called geoengineering that &apos;s looking at different techniques to delay warming , so we can take 20 or 30 years longer to get together . 
This is just an insurance method . 
You hope we don &apos;t need that . 
Some people say you shouldn &apos;t work on insurance at all because maybe it &apos;s lazy , so you eat , because you know you &apos;re going to save you from heart surgery . 
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart . If you look at the importance of this problem . But there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you should have that at your disposal . If things get faster or this innovation takes longer than we expect . 
CA : Climate skeptics , do you have one or two sentences for those to convince you ? 
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps . 
Those who make scientific arguments are very little , 
say there are negative effects that are related to clouds . They move things . 
There are very , very few things that you can even say , of which there is a chance in a million . 
The main problem here is very much like AIDS . 
You make the mistake . Now , and you pay for it much later . 
And so the idea now , if you have all kinds of urgent problems , is to invest in something that you only have later on . And to add , the investment is not so clear . In fact , the IPCC report is not necessarily . The worst scenario . And there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC and say , &quot; Okay . This is not a big drama . The 
fact is that this uncertainty should worry us . &quot; But 
my dream here is that if you can make it economically and at the same time eliminate CO2 , then the skeptics also say . Okay . I &apos;m not interested in it emitting CO2 . I almost wish it did . But I &apos;m probably going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . CA 
: And that would be your answer to the Björn Lomborg argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve the CO2 problem , you can do it . All the other goals . They &apos;re suffering from poverty reduction . The fight against malaria and so on , that it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources to invest money for it , while there are better things we can do . 
BG : Well , the actual spending on research , let &apos;s say , the U.S. should spend 10 billion more per year than they do today . That &apos;s not so dramatic . Underneath 
it should be other things . 
Not suffering . You get too much money . And here , reasonable people can disagree . If you have something that &apos;s not economic and tries to finance it . For me , most waste is happening here . 
Unless you &apos;re very close to a breakthrough in cost , you &apos;re just funding the learning curve . I think we should try more things that have the potential to be much cheaper . 
If the swab you get is a very high energy price . Then only the rich can keep up . 
I mean , each of us here could spend five times as much on our energy without changing our lifestyle . For 
the bottom two billion , 
but is it a disaster ? 
And even Lomborg thinks about his new mesh . Now why is research not being discussed anymore ? He 
&apos;s still being associated with the skeptic camp because of his earlier stories . But he understood that this is a very lonely group . And so he &apos;s now bringing the research argument . 
And this is a thought that I think is appropriate : 
Research . It &apos;s just crazy , how little . It &apos;s supported by 
Bill . I think I speak for almost all the people here . When I say , &quot; I really hope your wish will come true . &quot; Thank you very much . 
BG : Thank you . 
I &apos;d like to tell you something that I was told a few months ago when I wrote an article for Italian Wired . 
I always have my synonymous dictionary ready for writing . But I was already done with editing the text , and I noticed that I &apos;ve never been looking at it in my life . What the word &quot; obstructs &quot; really means . I &apos;m going to 
read you the entry &quot; Obstacles 
&quot; . ( Adjective : Curved ) Helpless , useless . Destruined . Deceased , mutilated . Wounded , prepared , paralyzed , separated . Keep it away . Defeat , weakened , impotent , castrated , paralyzed . Gehandicapt.senil Lack of age , withdrawn , repaired , done @ broken , borrowed , counted ( see also injured , useless and weak ) 
@ antonyme , healthy , strong @ efficient 
I read this list out loud to a friend and I had to laugh first . It worked so ridiculous . But I just got ready and couldn &apos;t speak any more and had to stop reading and collect myself first . After this outrageous flood of words and the emotional shock that it causes . 
Of course , this was a fractured old synonym dictionary . I just thought the issue has to be pretty old . But 
in fact , it was an issue in the early &apos; 80s . When I just started primary school , and that started building my self @-@ image outside of my family environment and forming it , including in relation to other children and the rest of the world . 
Around me , and thank God , I didn &apos;t use a synonymous dictionary at the time , 
I would take this entry seriously . If I were born into a world that someone like me would perceive as a person whose lives could not be positive in any way . But today , I &apos;m going to be for the opportunities and adventures I &apos;ve experienced . Famous . 
So I immediately called the 2009 online edition and expected me to make a more appealing contribution here . 
Here &apos;s the updated version . This entry , 
dummy enough , is not much better . 
In particular , the last two words shake me under Near Antonym . It &apos;s all healthy . But 
it &apos;s not just about the words . 
It &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with these words . 
It &apos;s about the values that are in those words and how we construct those values . 
Our language influences our thinking and how we influence the world and the people around us . 
Many ancient societies , including those of the Greeks and the Romans , really believed that the debate of a curse has a great force , because what you say loud can manifest itself . 
So what do we want ? Actually , manifest . A disabled person . People or a powerful person . People alone , 
to call a person careless as a child , could be enough to limit them and to impose ideas on them . 
Would it not be more beautiful to open doors to them ? 
A person who opened doors to me was my pediatrician . At the A.I. DuPont Institute in Wilmington , Delaware . 
His name is Dr. Pizzutillo . An Italo @-@ American whose name , you can imagine . Most Americans couldn &apos;t speak correctly . So he was always called Dr. P. 
And Dr. P. always wore very colorful flies and was just like being created for working with kids . 
I found the time I spent in this hospital just great except for my physiotherapy . 
I had to repeat individual exercises , seemingly infinitely , with these thick elastic bands in different colors . You know that around . Building my leg muscles . And I hated these bands more than anything else . I hated them . I cursed them . I hated them . 
And imagine I &apos;ve even been a kid of five with Dr. P. And so I try to stop these exercises . Natural , without success . 
And one day he watched me doing one of my exercises . These exercises were just tiring and merciless . And he said to me , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young . Girl : You &apos;re going to tear one of these tapes one day . 
And if you can do it , I &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot; 
That was , of course , just a simple trick by Dr. P. to do the exercises I didn &apos;t want to do . With the prospect that the richest five @-@ year @-@ old girl will be in the hospital on the second floor . But he actually got me to look at my daily exercise horror with new eyes . So it became a new and promising experience . 
And I wonder today how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful young man . Girl shaped my self @-@ image , and I could imagine myself as one of nature &apos;s strong , powerful and atlethic people . 
This is just one example of many . How adults in power positions can inspire a child &apos;s 
imagination ? But like the examples from the synonymous dictionaries already cited , our language doesn &apos;t allow us any space to imagine something . What we all want would allow each and every one of us to see themselves as powerful people . 
Our language lags behind the social changes that in many cases have been triggered by technological change 
, from the medical point of view . From the perspective of course , one can say that my legs , laser surgery for visually impaired , knee joints made of titanium and artificial hip joints for aging bodies , which allow people to really use all their possibilities and to transcend the limits that their natural destiny has set them , not to speak at all . Social networking platforms enable people to have their own identity , give themselves their own way of defining themselves , 
and thereby orient themselves globally to groups that they choose . 
So maybe this technological shift makes it clearer . Because ever before , there has always been a different truth , which is that every human being has something very special and very powerful to society , and that human ability to adapt . Our greatest plus is 
human ability to adapt . This is an interesting story . Because people keep asking me to tell me how to deal with adversity . And I &apos;ll confess something to you : This sentence has . Never fit for me , and I &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable with asking people &apos;s questions about it . And I think gradually I understand why . 
This sentence about dealing with adversity lives on the idea that success or happiness depends on it . Tackling a challenge without being shaped by the experience that it entails . As if my life had been so successful , because I could have avoided the possible traps of a life with a prosthesis . Or anyway , people perceive me with my disability . 
But the truth is that we are changing . Of course , we are shaped by the challenge . Whether it &apos;s physical , emotional or even both . 
And I claim that &apos;s good . 
Adversity is not an obstacle that we need to curve to make our lives clearer . 
Adversity is just part of our lives . 
And I tend to see adversity as my shadow . 
Sometimes I realize it &apos;s very present . Sometimes it &apos;s hard to see , but it &apos;s always with me . 
And I don &apos;t want to mean by any means to reduce the impact or severity of a human being &apos;s struggle . 
There are adversity and challenges in life . And they &apos;re all too real . And each person is different with it . But the question is not whether we can get clear with adversity or not , but how we get clear with it . 
So we &apos;re not just responsible for that . The people we love to keep from blows of fate , but also to prepare them for it . All right . So that &apos;s it . Let &apos;s get it right . 
And we &apos;re not doing our kids a favor . If we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt . You have to do two things . 
All right . Separate . One is that the medical fact of being amputated . And the other is that the social opinion about whether I &apos;m disabled or not . 
And to be honest , the only real and lasting disability I had to deal with is that the world is constantly saying , &quot; &quot; It can describe me with these definitions . 
&quot; In our desire to protect the people who care about us and to tell them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis , or even a prognosis of the quality of life that they need to expect . We must be careful not to lay the foundation for someone actually being disabled . 
Perhaps the current concept is just about what &apos;s broken . And how we fix that , for each individual , a greater disability than pathology itself . 
If we don &apos;t treat a person holistically and don &apos;t perceive all of his forces and possibilities . And we recognize that , in addition to the natural struggle that you may have to fight , 
we create . Another disease . We degrade a person who has value for our society . 
So we have to look beyond patology and look at all areas of human possibilities . 
Most importantly , it &apos;s that there &apos;s a gap between perception of our shortcomings and our great inventive spirit . 
We should not devalue or deny these challenging times . We should not try to avoid them . We should not sweep them under the carpet , but we should try to identify opportunities in adversity . 
I may be more interested in making it clear that we do not necessarily have to overcome adversity , but that we are open to embracing it . Put them in the head to use a campaign expression , and maybe even dance with it . 
And maybe we can create adversity as something natural , coherent and useful to see and feel , through their presence , no longer so burdened . 
This year we celebrate Charles Darwin &apos;s 200th birthday . And when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , Darwin , in my view , has something very true in human character . 
I would describe it like this : &quot; Not the strongest of its kind survives , nor the smartest of its kind , but the one that can best adapt to change . 
&quot; Conflict creates creativity , not just 
from Darwin &apos;s work . Do we know that man &apos;s ability to survive and flourish from the struggle of the human mind ? It &apos;s determined to change through conflict . 
So again , change and adaptation are the greatest abilities of man . 
And maybe we know only from what wood . We &apos;re carved when we &apos;re really tested . 
Maybe that &apos;s the meaning of adversity . A sense of ego , a sense of our own power . 
We can give ourselves something like that . 
We can give adversity a new meaning that goes beyond difficult times . 
Maybe we can see adversity as change . 
Adversity represents a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to yet . 
I think the greatest damage we &apos;ve done to ourselves is to believe that we should be normal . 
Let &apos;s face it , who &apos;s normal ? 
There &apos;s no normal . 
There &apos;s the usual , the typical , but not the normal , and would you be this poor , gray person ? Really want to get to know if they really existed . 
I don &apos;t think it would be great . 
If we could counter this pattern of normality against another of the possibilities or the strength , to put it a little more dangerously . Could exchange . So we can unleash the forces of very many children . And invite them to put their very special and valuable skills into society . 
Anthropolgen has found that we humans , from the members of our society , have always demanded one thing : To be useful and to contribute . 
There are indications that even the Neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , older people and people with severe physical injuries . They &apos;ve worn with them , and that may have happened because the life experience in the struggle for survival of these people has been valuable to society . 
They haven &apos;t seen these people as broken and useless . They &apos;ve been treated as something special and valuable . 
A few years ago , I went to the city where I grew up in , to a food market . In that Red Zone in the northeast of Pennsylvania , and I stood in front of a cup of tomatoes . 
It was summer . And I had shorts , and 
I hear a guy . Behind me says , &quot; Well , if that &apos;s not Aimee Mullins , 
and I turn around and see this older man . &quot; I had no idea who he was . 
And I said , &quot; Excuse me . Sir , do we know ? &quot; I can &apos;t remember you . And 
he said , &quot; Well , you &apos;re not likely to remember me . &quot; When 
I first saw you , I saw her out of her mother &apos;s belly . 
Oh . So , the 
, and of course , it did , but click . 
This was Dr. Kean . A man I just told from my mother &apos;s stories about this day , because of course , I was typical of my birthday , two weeks late 
, the doctor for prenatal diagnosis of my mother was on vacation . And so my parents knew the man who gave me birth at all . 
And because I was born without a calf &apos;s legs . And my feet had turned to them , and I just had a few toes on this one and a few toes . On the other foot , he was the handler . This stranger had to bring the bad news . 
He said to me , &quot; I had to tell your parents that you would never walk and would never be so mobile . Like other kids , or you could never live an independent life . And since then , they &apos;ve just punished me with lies . Really 
? Exceptionally , I found that he collected newspaper clips of my entire childhood . Whether I was winning a letter contest in second grade , whether I was winning with the scouts on Halloween parade , whether I was on my scholarship or one of my sporting victories , and he was using these clips to get his students to teach , Medical students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School . 
And he called this part of his course &quot; The X Factor : The Potential of Human Will . 
&quot; You just can &apos;t stress enough how critical this factor can be for a human being &apos;s quality of life . 
And Dr. Kean went on to tell us . He said , &quot; I learned that if you don &apos;t get something else constantly , children will get to say something else . And even if you get a little bit of support , if you leave kids to yourself , children can achieve a lot . Look 
. Dr. Kean has changed his thinking . 
He understood that medical diagnosis and how someone deals with it are 
two different things . And I too have changed my thinking over time . If you asked me at the age of 15 , would I have my prostheses exchanged for legs made of meat and bone , then I would not have hesitated for a second . 
I really wanted to be normal at the time . 
If you ask me that today , I &apos;m not so sure . 
And that &apos;s what happened because I &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , not despite those experiences . 
And maybe that change could happen because I &apos;ve met so many people who opened doors to me instead of meeting people who restrict me or give me an idea . 
See ? It really only takes a person to demonstrate to you . How can you manifest your forces ? And you &apos;re through , 
if you allow someone to activate their own inner forces . The human mind is so receptive . If you do that , and for someone to open a door at a critical moment . Then you &apos;re a very good teacher for these people . 
You teach them to open doors to themselves . 
The real meaning of the word educate is rooted in the word educe . It 
means to create something that is in one : To tickle out the potential , 
again , what potential do we want ? Because now , 
retrieve : In the &apos; 60s , a case study was done in Britain . Back then , high schools were transformed into schools . 
They call that streaming trials . In the United States , we call that tracking . 
Students are divided into grades . 
And the A students get more orally tested . The better teachers , etc . 
, they have students with enough grade , very good , over a three @-@ month period . They were told they were aces , they were very smart . And after those three months , they really wrote one . 
And of course , it breaks your heart to hear that the other way around , the one @-@ serer students were told . They were just enough . And 
it was the same . After the three months , too . But only 
those who were still in school , apart from the students who had thrown the school . 
And it was absolutely crucial . And what this study was about was that the teachers were not inaugurated . 
The teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed . 
They were just told that they were the Einser students , and that the students with the grade are sufficient . And they were also teaching them something 
, and they treated the only real disability is a broken mind . A spirit that was broken has no hope anymore . It &apos;s not beautiful anymore , it &apos;s missing . Our natural , childish curiosity and our innate ability to imagination . But 
if we can help the human mind to continue to hope , to hope for itself and other people around it , to find themselves beautiful , curious and imaginative . Then we really put our forces in a positive position . 
One : If a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new forms of existence . 
I want to end with a poem written by a Persian poet named Hafiz in the 14th century . And my friend Jacques Dembois told me about that , and the poem is called &quot; The God Who Knows Only Four Words . &quot; Every child doesn &apos;t know God , the God of the Name . Not the God of Forbitions , but the God Who Knows Only Four Words . And repeats them all the time . He only always says , 
&quot; Come dance with me . &quot; Come dance with me . Thank you very much .
