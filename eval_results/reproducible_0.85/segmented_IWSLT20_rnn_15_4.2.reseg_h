A few years ago here at TED , Peter Skillman launched a design competition called &quot; The Marshmallow Challenge . 
&quot; The idea is pretty simple . Four teams have to have the widest possible freestanding structure with 20 spaghetti . CA : 1m tape . CA : 1m thread and build a marshmallow . 
The marshmallow has to be up there . 
And though it &apos;s really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard . Because it &apos;s pushing people to work together very quickly . 
And so I thought this was a really interesting idea . And I did it into a design workshop . 
It was a huge success . 
Since then , I &apos;ve had about 70 workshops around the world with students , developers and architects , even CTOs , the Fortune 50 companies . And there &apos;s something about this task . What deep impressions into nature are about the nature of cooperation . And I want to share some of these with you . 
Normally , most people start themselves . As regards the task , orienting themselves . 
They talk about it . They think about what it will look like . They &apos;re rangling for power . 
Then they invest a little time in planning and organization , they sketch and lay spaghetti , spaghetti . 
They invest a lot of their time in assembling together constantly growing structures . 
And finally , just before they don &apos;t have time anymore , someone takes the Marshmallow , and they gently put it . And to the top , they take a step back and TA @-@ da , you admire their work . 
But then , almost always , what happens is that TA @-@ da becomes an UH @-@ Oh , because the weight of the marshmallow causes the whole thing to bend and collapse . 
There &apos;s a series of people who have a lot more UH @-@ Oh moments than others , and among the worst are freshest BWL graduates . 
They lie , they cheat . They &apos;re confused and they produce really poor shapes . 
And of course , there are also teams that have a lot more TA @-@ DA formations . And among the best are freshly graduates of the kindergarten . 
And that &apos;s quite amazing , 
like Peter told us . &quot; Don &apos;t just produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all . 
What you might ask is , how does this come about ? &quot; Why ? What about those ? 
And Peter doesn &apos;t tell one . The kids spend time investing in it . Head of Spaghetti GmbH . They 
don &apos;t invest time in power struggles . 
There &apos;s still one more reason , however , 
and that is that BWL students were trained to do a real plan . OK . 
And then to realize it . 
What happens when they do the Marshmallow on the top , put it on top ? They don &apos;t have time anymore . And what happens ? 
It &apos;s a crisis . 
Sounds familiar , what kindergarten 
kids do differently is they do with the Marshmallow , and they start prototypes . Successful prototypes , always with the Marshmallow at the top , so they &apos;re multiple times able to get dilapidated prototypes , repair . 
Constructors recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of an iterative process . 
And with every attempt , the kids get immediate feedback , what works and what doesn &apos;t work . 
So this is the performance of prototypes working . But essentially , let &apos;s see how different teams operate . 
The average for most is that for most , they &apos;re about 50 centimeters of BWL students creating . Half of them lawyers , a little bit more , but not much kindergarten kids are better than adults . 
Who is most successful architect and 
engineer ? Fortunately , 1m , 
the highest . What I &apos;ve seen 
and why ? Because they understand triangles . And self @-@ reinforcing geometric patterns are the keys to stable structures to build . 
CEOs are a little above average . But here it is . 
Interestingly , you put an executive administrator . On the team , they get significantly better . 
It &apos;s incredible . You can see around and see . This team will win . You 
can predict that . Why is that ? 
Because you have special process monitoring skills . 
You run the process . You understand it 
and that team . That regulates and focuses on work . Will the performance of the team be significantly improved 
? Specialized skills and process skills and their combination will lead to success . 
If you have 10 teams that are typical of what you do , you get about six , which have stable structures . 
I tried something exciting . 
I thought , let &apos;s get the poker bet right away . 
So I offered a $ 10,000 prize of software for the winners . 
What do you think happened to these design students ? 
What was that ? 
Result . This happened . No team had a stable structure . 
If anyone had a two @-@ inch construction built , he would have won the prize home . 
Is it not interesting , then , that high betting has a strong effect ? 
We repeated this exercise with the same students . 
What do you think ? It happened now . 
Do you understand the advantage of prototyping ? 
So it turned out to be the same bad team , one of the best . 
They made the highest construction in the least time . 
There are , therefore , profound lessons for us about the nature of propulsion and success . 
You may ask . Why would someone actually invest time , a Marshmallow challenge , to create ? 
The reason is , I help digital tools and processes create to teams to help . Cars , video games and visual effects . 
And what the Marshmallow Challenge does is : It helps them create hidden assumptions , 
Because frankly , every project has its own Marshmallow . The challenge is to 
have a shared experience . A common language or basic attitude , the right prototype to 
build . And this is the value of this experience . This so simple exercise 
and those of you who have an interest in it can do . 
MarshmallowChallenge COM Visit It &apos;s a blog where you can see how to get the Marshmallows built . 
There &apos;s a step @-@ by @-@ step guide there . 
You &apos;ll find crazy examples from all over the world , like people optimize and refining the system . 
There &apos;s also world records , 
and the basal lesson , I think , is the construction . In fact , a connecting sport is 
it requires that we all have our senses to be focused on the task , and that we use our thinking optimally , like our emotions and our actions in the challenge that we face , and that we use our thinking optimally . 
And sometimes , a small prototype of this experience is . Everything it takes us to get away from an UH @-@ Oh to a TA @-@ DA moment . 
And that can make a big difference . 
Thank you very much . 
Let &apos;s pretend we have here as if we have a machine . 
A big machine . A cool TED @-@ like machine . And that &apos;s a time machine . 
And everybody in this room has to enter . 
And you can enter the past . You can enter the future . You can &apos;t go into the here 
and now . And I wonder what you choose . Because you would choose , because I &apos;ve been talking to my friends a lot recently . This question was asked , and they all wanted to go into the past . 
I don &apos;t know . They wanted to go back to time . Before cars were there or Twitter or America is looking for the superstar . 
I don &apos;t know . 
I &apos;m convinced that somehow you &apos;re going to be drawn to nostalgia , to wishful thinking . 
And that &apos;s what I understand . 
I &apos;m not part of it . This group , I have to say , 
I don &apos;t want to go back to the past , and that &apos;s not because I &apos;m an adventurer . 
It &apos;s because opportunities on this table are not back on the planet . They &apos;re going forward . 
I want to go into this machine . And I want to go into the future . 
This is the greatest time it &apos;s ever been on this planet . No matter what scale you &apos;re setting , health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , falling rates of disease . 
There has never been a time like this before . 
My great grandparents all died . When they were 60 , 
my grandparents pushed this number to 70 . 
My parents are 80 , 80 , on their heels . 
There should be better a nine . At the beginning of my death . 
But it &apos;s not even about people like us . Because this is a bigger thing than that . 
A kid who &apos;s in New Delhi today can expect to be born for so long as he &apos;s the richest man on earth . 100 years ago , you 
think about it . This is an incredible fact . 
And why is this ? Smallpox , 
smallpox , smallpox , has billions of people on this planet killed . 
They &apos;ve got the demographics of the Earth in a way that they &apos;ve not redesigned war ever managed to do . 
They &apos;re gone . They &apos;ve disappeared . 
We &apos;ve defeated them . Puff 
in the rich world , diseases exist that millions of us have just one generation ago , threatened by . Hardly any 
diphtheria yet . Rubella Polio knows 
at all . Someone else knows what that is . Vaccines 
, modern medicine . Our ability to reach out to billions of people . These are successes of the scientific method . 
And from my point of view , the scientific method is to try things out . Whether it works . It changes . If it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity . 
This is the good news . 
Unfortunately , this is the whole good news . Because there &apos;s a few other problems . And they &apos;ve been mentioned many times . 
And one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people in the world every day are hungry to go to bed . 
This number is rising , and it &apos;s rising very quickly . And that &apos;s embarrassing . 
And not only that . We have our imagination used to use this world to 
thoroughly devastate , drinking water , priceless land . Rainforests , oil . Gas . They disappear . And soon . And if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos , we also disappear . 
The question is , can we do that ? I think so . 
I think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food . The billions of people who feed without the land on which they live , without rape . 
I think we can make this world energy @-@ powered , that they don &apos;t destroy at the same time . 
I think that &apos;s really what it is . And no . That &apos;s not wishful thinking . 
But this is holding me awake at night . One of the things that awakes me at night . We have scientific progress never before , so much needed as we have never before . 
And we &apos;ve also never been to the point where we could use it sensibly , as we do today . 
We &apos;re at the threshold of amazing , amazing events on many fronts . And yet I really think we really have hundreds of 300 years before the Enlightenment , back to be able to go back to find a time when we &apos;re fighting progress , where we &apos;re talking about these things more vigorously , on more fronts than we have now . 
People are wrapping themselves in their faith and that &apos;s so narrow that you can &apos;t put them free . 
Not even . The truth will free them . 
And listen . Everybody has a right to their opinion . Even a right to their opinion on progress . 
But you know what they don &apos;t have a right to . 
They don &apos;t have a right to their own . Facts , charges , they don &apos;t have . 
And I have a while to get that out of the way , 
about a decade ago , I published an article about immunization for The New Yorker , a little article . 
And I was amazed at resistance to meet resistance , resistance to resistance to what ended up being the most effective measure in healthcare in history , in the history of humanity . 
I didn &apos;t know what to do . So I just did what I always do . I wrote an article and I went on . 
And soon afterwards , I wrote an article about genetically modified . Food : The 
same thing , just bigger . 
People played crazy . 
So I also talked about an article about it . And I couldn &apos;t understand why . People thought that was frankenfood , why they believed that molecules were on a certain molecule , rather than a random way , to move around , an attack on the territory of nature . 
But you know , I do what I do . I wrote the article . I kept going . 
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist . 
We type . We pass in . We go eat . That &apos;s okay . 
But these articles made me worry . And I couldn &apos;t figure out why . And eventually , I found out . 
And that &apos;s because these fanatics are the fanatics who made me crazy . Anyway . No fanatics were . 
These were prudent people , educated people , decent people . 
They were just like people in the same room . 
And that brought me so much confusion . 
But then I thought , &quot; You know what ? Let &apos;s be honest . 
We &apos;re on a point where we &apos;ve reached a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we used to have . 
We &apos;re talking about it in two ways . 
We &apos;re talking about it ironically , with small quotes . So progress . Okay 
. There &apos;s a reason for that . And I think we know what reasons that is . 
We have confidence in institutions , in authority and sometimes in institutions , in science itself , in themselves . And there &apos;s no reason why that &apos;s not so . 
You can just do a few names . And people will understand 
Chernobyl , Bhopal . Challenger @ Vioxx weapons of mass destruction , the 2000 US presidential election . I mean , 
you know , you can have your own list . 
There are questions and problems with the people of whom we are believed to be always having the right . Be , therefore , skeptical . 
Ask questions , ask evidence . Ask evidence . 
Get evidence . Take nothing but given . 
But now it &apos;s when you get evidence , you have to accept that evidence . And in that , we &apos;re not good at . And I 
can do that for the reason that we &apos;re now in a epidemic of epidemic of fear , as I do , which I &apos;ve never seen before , and hopefully never see again . 
About 12 years ago , a story was published . A terrible story that the Autism epidemic had with the measles , mumps and rubells , vaccine , linked . 
Very scary , 
shocking , shocking . Studies were done to see if there was a true , 
shoddy story . Studies were to be done . This is a serious issue . 
The data came in . 
The data came in from the United States , from England , from Sweden , from Canada . And they were all the same , no correlation . No connection , no connection at all . 
It doesn &apos;t make any difference . It doesn &apos;t make any difference . Because we have faith in anecdotes . We believe what we see , what we see , what we believe to see , what causes us to feel real . 
We don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents from a government clerk who gives us data . And I understand that . I think that &apos;s what we do . We all do . 
But you know what ? 
The result of that was catastrophic , catastrophic . 
Because of that fact . The United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccination rate for measles is falling . 
That &apos;s scandalous . And we should be ashamed . 
It &apos;s terrible . 
What happened ? That we do that . 
Well , I understand that . That &apos;s what I do . Because here 
&apos;s somebody here who has measles . Has 
a single one in the audience ? Anyone in the audience who sees someone die of measles 
doesn &apos;t happen very often . That &apos;s where it 
doesn &apos;t happen at all . But 160,000 times on the planet . Last year , 160.000 times . 
That &apos;s a lot of measles &apos; deaths . 20 per hour . 
But because that &apos;s not what happened here , we can displace it . And people like Jenny McCarthy can walk around and messages of fear and illiteracy , platforms , like Oprah and Larry , King Live Preach . And 
that &apos;s what they can do because they cause and correlation not connect . 
They don &apos;t understand that these things are the same , but they almost never seem the same . 
And that &apos;s something that we learn to learn . And that &apos;s very fast . 
This guy was a hero . Jonas Salk . 
He liberated us from one of the worst scourges of humanity . Don &apos;t worry 
, no pain , polio . Puff disappeared . 
The guy in the middle , not so much . 
His name is Paul Offit . 
He &apos;s just got a few other people with a Rotavirus vaccine . 
He can live the lives of 400 , 500,000 children a year in the developing world in the developing world . 
Very good . Not . 
Well , that &apos;s good . Apart from Paul walking around and talking about vaccines and saying , &quot; How valuable they are and that the people are just going to stop thinking about complaining . 
&quot; And that &apos;s what he actually says . 
So Paul is a terrorist . 
If Paul is a public hearing , he can &apos;t speak without armed guards , 
he can &apos;t say . He gets calls at home because the people tell him they like to tell him where they know where his kids are going to school . 
And why ? Because Paul has made a vaccine . 
I need not say that . But vaccines are essential . 
Take them away . Turn the diseases back . Terrible diseases . And that &apos;s what &apos;s happening right now . 
We have in this country now measles . 
And that &apos;s getting worse . And pretty soon , kids will get to die of it again . Because that &apos;s just a question of numbers . 
And they won &apos;t just be on measles . 
What about polio ? Let &apos;s take that . Why not ? 
A fellow militant of mine told me a few weeks ago , and said , &quot; She believes I &apos;m a little bit too shrill . 
Nobody has that . Ever before , 
she said she would not fight polio against polio . No way , 
fine . 
Why ? Because we don &apos;t have polio . And you know what ? 
We had in this country yesterday no polio . 
Today , I don &apos;t know . Maybe today morning somebody went up in Lagos to an airplane and flies just after Los Angeles , you know . Right now , he &apos;s over Ohio 
and into a few hours he ends up . He rents and rents a car . And he comes to Long Beach . And he &apos;s going to be one of those fantastic things . TEDDinner tonight , visit TEDDinner . 
And he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s going to be infected with a paralyzing disease . And we know that , too . Because that &apos;s how the world works . Well , 
that &apos;s the planet on which we live . Do not do it as if it 
&apos;s not . We love it in lies . We love that . 
Do you have everybody this morning ? Your vitamins : 
Echinacea . A little antioxidant that will put you on the leaps . 
I know you &apos;re doing that . Because the half of the Americans , every day , do that . 
They take the stuff . And they take alternative remedies . And it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re useless . 
The data shows this all the time . 
They evaporate their urine . More do they almost never do . 
This is okay . They like 28 billion dollars for the dark urine to pay . 
I agree with you completely 
: Dark urine , dark . 
Why do we do this ? Why do we do this ? 
Well , I think I understand . We hate the pharmaceutical industry . 
We hate one too strong government . We don &apos;t have confidence in the system . 
And that &apos;s what we shouldn &apos;t . Our healthcare system is bad . 
It &apos;s cruel to millions of people . 
It &apos;s absolutely amazingly cold and soul @-@ reeling , even to us , who can afford it . 
We &apos;re running away from it and where are we going ? 
We &apos;re walking into the arms of the placebo industry . 
That &apos;s great . I love the placebo industry . 
But you know , that &apos;s really a serious business . Because the stuff is crap . And we &apos;re giving billions of dollars for it . 
And I &apos;ve got all sorts of little props here , 
none of them : Gingko fraud , Echinacea fraud , Acai . And I don &apos;t even know what that is . But we &apos;re giving billions of dollars for it . It &apos;s cheating . 
And you know what ? If I say that , I &apos;m being screamed at by people and they say , &quot; What cares you ? Let &apos;s do it . &quot; People , anyway , do what they want . That &apos;s 
how they feel good . And 
you know what ? They &apos;re wrong 
because it doesn &apos;t matter to me whether it &apos;s the Health Minister . He says , &quot; Hmm , I &apos;m going to get the evidence from my experts on mammography , or any cancer quack salver who wants to treat his patients with coffee intakes . 
&quot; If you focus on this path , where do you believe and magic , evidence and science replace ? If you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be . 
You get to Thabo Mbeki in South Africa . 
He brought 400,000 of his people around because he was insisting on insisting that red beds , garlic and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs , of which we know they &apos;re going to be the ones that can slow down the course of AIDS . 
Hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country . Worse than any other of these , this disease is 
plagued , you tell me , please do not tell me that these things have no consequences . 
They have them . They have them always . 
Well , the most brain @-@ free epidemic we &apos;re in is this absurd fight between the two proponents of genetically modified foods . And the bio @-@ elite . 
That &apos;s an idiotic debate . It has to stop . 
It &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors . 
That &apos;s ideology , not science . 
Everything we eat . Every grain of rice , every branch of parsley . Every sprouts has been made by people . 
You know , there were no mandarin in paradise . 
There were no cantaloupe melons . There were no Christmas trees . We have all done this . 
We have it in the last 11 000 years . 
And some of it worked and some of it didn &apos;t . 
We got rid of what didn &apos;t work . 
Now we can do it more precisely . And of course , there are risks . But we can do something like vitamin A in rice . And the stuff can get millions of people to help . Millions of people to prolong their lives . 
That &apos;s not what they want to do . 
I have to say , I don &apos;t understand . 
We reject genetically modified food . 
Why do we do that ? 
Well , what I hear all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture . We don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing . That &apos;s wrong . 
We don &apos;t want companies to patent lives . 
We don &apos;t want companies to own seeds . 
And you know what ? My answer to all of this is 
yes . You &apos;re right . Let &apos;s fix that . 
It &apos;s true . We have a huge food problem . But that &apos;s not science . 
That &apos;s science . 
It &apos;s not science . It &apos;s morality . Patent stuff . 
You know that science is not a company . 
It &apos;s not a country . 
It &apos;s not even an idea . It &apos;s a process . 
It &apos;s a process . And sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t . But the idea that we can give science no permission to do their work . Because we &apos;re afraid , it &apos;s a real impasse . And it keeps millions of people from flourishing . 
You know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to get 70 percent more food to grow . When we &apos;re 70 percent now 
investing in Africa . In the last 30 years , 
embarrassing , shameful . 
You need that . And we &apos;re giving it to you . 
And why ? Genetically modified food . 
We want people not to encourage this rotten stuff to eat like the one Maniok . 
Maniok is something that &apos;s half a billion people eating . 
It &apos;s about like a potato . 
It &apos;s just a bunch of calories . It &apos;s bad . 
It doesn &apos;t have nutrients . It doesn &apos;t have protein . And scientists are building all of this right in there . 
And then the people could eat the food and wouldn &apos;t be blinded . 
They wouldn &apos;t starve . And you know what ? 
That would be nice . It wouldn &apos;t be Chez Panisse . But it would be nice . 
And everything I did to say about this is why . Let &apos;s fight this . 
I mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves . Why do we fight this ? 
Because we don &apos;t want to push genes around . 
It &apos;s not about pushing genes around . It &apos;s not about chemicals . 
It &apos;s not about our ridiculous ones . Passion for hormones . Our insistence on greater food , better food , unique food . 
It &apos;s not about rice krispies , here . It &apos;s about people living . And it &apos;s high time to understand what this means . 
Because , you know what ? 
If we don &apos;t do that , if we keep on going as we have done before . Let &apos;s get to blame for something that we believe we owe , I don &apos;t want to be guilty of . High @-@ tech colonialism . 
There &apos;s no other description for that . What &apos;s happening here ? 
It &apos;s selfish . It &apos;s ugly . It &apos;s not worthy of us . And we have to really stop that . 
After this incredibly fun conversation , you want to say , maybe you always want to be in this ridiculous time machine . And into the future 
. Anyway , anyway . That &apos;s what I want anyway . 
Right now , she &apos;s in the present . But we have an incredible opportunity . 
We can use this time machine to put it all on . What we want , 
we can move it where we move it , where we want to move it . And we will get it to move there . Where we want to go . 
We need to have these conversations . And we need to think . But if we go into the time machine and into the future , we will be happy to see that we &apos;ve done that . 
I know we &apos;re able to , and as far as I &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something that the world needs now . 
Thank you . 
Thank you . When Steve Lopez , a columnist of the Los Angeles Times , one day , walked through the streets in the center of Los Angeles , he heard a wonderful music . 
She came from a man , an African @-@ American , sympathetic , rough , homeless , who was playing on a violin that had only two strings left . 
Many of you will tell the story . Because from Steve &apos;s article about this , a book later became filmed , again . Robert Downey , Junior , when Steve Lopez . And Jamie Foxx , when Nathaniel Anthony Ayers , the contrabass player at the Juilliard Conservatory , studied and tragically early on through his paranoid schizophrenia , ended his promising career . 
Nathaniel left Juilliard , suffered a nervous breakdown . And 30 years later , he lived as homeless on the streets of Skid Row . In the center of Los Angeles . 
I recommend to all of you that you read Steves &apos; book , or watch the movie , so that you not only understand the wonderful connection . The links between these two men that arose , but also , like the music , make this connection . Helped . And how they eventually made the instrument when this play of words is allowed . That helped Nathaniel away from the street to get away . 
I met Mr. Ayers in 2008 , and I was very happy to see him . Two years ago , in the Walt Disney Concert Hall . 
He just had a demonstration of Beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony and four , and he came behind the stage to get to know me . 
He spoke in a very cheerful and convivial tone about yo @-@ yo . MA : And Hillary Clinton and about how the Dodgers never heard it in baseball world and series , and I think he could . And all of this because of the insidious passage of the first violin in the last sentence of Beethoven . Fourth Symphony : We came up with the theme of &quot; Music . 
&quot; And a few days later , I got an email in which I said that Nathaniel was in favor of violin lessons with me . 
I still have to mention that Nathaniel is a person who refused medical treatment , because he was already in charge of electric shocks and thorazine and handcuffs . Trauma that has caused him to suffer all his life . 
As a result , he &apos;s now particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases . They &apos;re sometimes so bad that they can make him tear up . And he &apos;s disappearing for days . In the streets of Skid Row , he &apos;s always wandering around this horror and the torture torment of his own mind , 
and in just as much a stage of excitement , Nathaniel was when we were in our first lesson at the Walt Disney Concert Hall . He had this crazy flicker in his eyes and he was working completely lost . 
He talked about invisible demons and smoke and about how he was being caught in sleep by someone . 
I was afraid , not for me , but for fear that I was going to lose him , that he was going to sink into one of his states , and that I was going to destroy his relationship with the violin . If I started talking about clay ladders and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy , 
I would like to say that . I would just start talking to you . 
I would play the first sentence of Beethoven &apos;s violin concerto . 
And while I was playing , I noticed that in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes , a complete change is taking place . 
It was as if he was going to be under the influence of an invisible doctor , a chemical reaction of its catalyst . My game was 
Nathaniel &apos;s maniac . Wrath turned into understanding , into an easy curiosity and grace , 
And as if by a miracle , he took his violin and began to listen . Some excerpts of violin concerts to play and asked me , &quot; Then she &apos;ll finish playing them . &quot; Mendelssohn Chaikovsky , Sibelius . We started then about music , 
and we started talking about music . From Bach to Beethoven , Brahms , Bruckner and all the others BS of Bartók to Beethoven , to Esa @-@ Pekka Salonen . 
And I realized that he wasn &apos;t just a cyclopedic knowledge , he wasn &apos;t only an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but he also had a close personal relationship with it . 
He talked about her with a passion and a sense that she had , which I usually only talked about from my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic , 
by making music , playing music and talking about music , was from this paranoid , confused man who was just being thrown through the streets of Los Angeles , a kind of educated , excellent in Juilliard trained musician , who was a great musician . 
Music is medicine . Music changes us 
for Nathaniel , meaning music is mental health . 
Because music allows us to do it . His thoughts and delusions , with the help of imagination and creativity , into something real . 
And so he escapes his tormenting state . 
I understood that this is the very nature of art . 
This is exactly why this is why we make music so that we can do something within all of us deep inside , deep inside . Our feelings through our artistic lens , through our creativity , towards reality , can shape . 
And reality of that expression reaches us all , and moves , inspires and unites us what 
Nathaniel was about . So he was brought back by music to a community of friends . 
The redeeming power of music brought him back to a family , from musicians who brought him to understand , who had recognized his talent and respected him . 
And I &apos;m going to talk to Nathaniel again and again . Whether in the Walt Disney Concert , Hall or in Skid , Row , because he reminds me of why I was a musician , he reminds me . 
Thank you very much . 
Bruno Giussani : Thank you . Thank you . 
Robert Gupta , 
Robert Gupta . I want to play something that I shamefully love stolen the cellist . 
I hope you will forgive me . 
I &apos;m Jane McGonigal . I design computer games . 
I &apos;m now developing for 10 years online games , and my goal for the next decade is to make it just as easy . The world where reality is saving the world as it does in online games is 
saving . I have a plan for that . I want more people to convince , including all of you , more time playing . Greater and more great games to spend . 
Right now , we spend three billion hours a week playing online . 
Some of you may think , &quot; This is a lot of time for games . 
Maybe something too much time . &quot; If you think about how many problems we &apos;re facing in real world as a 
matter of urgency , in fact . But my research at the Institute for the Future , according to my research , is exactly the opposite . 
Right ? Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to make the most pressing problems in the world . 
Indeed , I am convinced that if we are to move to this planet for the next century , we will dramatically increase this time . 
I calculated that the time needed to do that is 21 billion hours of playing time . Per week 
, that &apos;s what it might seem a little bit absurd to start with . So I repeat it with that . It can work if we can have problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , believe . I have to try and play online for at least 21 billion hours a week , up to the end of the next decade . 
No . I mean , it &apos;s really serious . 
Why ? This 
picture pretty accurately describes . Why ? I think games are so vital to the survival of human beings . Serious . 
This is a portrait of the photographer . Phil Toledano . 
He wanted to make the feelings capture when playing . So he &apos;s in front of the players , he &apos;s built a camera . 
This is one of the classic expressions when playing . 
If you &apos;re not a player , you may miss some of the nuances . In this picture , 
you probably see this sense of urgency , some fear , but also extreme concentration , deeply deepened into solving a real real difficult problem . 
If you play , you see some nuances . Here &apos;s the upward @-@ drawn eyes . And the mouth is a sign of optimism . The eyebrows show surprise . 
This is a player who &apos;s on the edge of what &apos;s called a &quot; surrogate . &quot; 
Epic victory : Oh . You know that ? 
OK . Great . So we have some players . Here &apos;s 
an epic . Victory is a result that &apos;s so very positive that it &apos;s so positive that you didn &apos;t even know before that it was possible at all . 
It was almost beyond imagination . And if you can do it , you &apos;re shocked that you actually have to be able to do 
that . That &apos;s an epical victory . 
This player is about to be an epic victory . 
And this is what we &apos;re going to see on millions of faces of problem solvers around the world . If we can overcome the hurdles of the next century , the face of those who face the odds . On the edge of an epic victory . 
Well , unfortunately , we see this face more in real life . If we face difficult problems , 
I call it the &quot; that . &quot; In life , I &apos;m bad face . 
And it &apos;s actually my face . Look , yeah . OK . 
That &apos;s me . How I do that in life ? I &apos;m bad face . 
This is a graffiti in my former home country in Berkeley , California , where I live in my Ph.D. study of why we do better in games than in real life . 
This is a problem . This is a problem that many players have . 
We think that in reality , we &apos;re not as good as in games . And 
I don &apos;t mean just less successful , although that &apos;s part of it . 
We &apos;re reaching more in games . 
I mean , good in connection with motivation , something important about doing . Inspired in collaboration with each other . 
If we &apos;re in a game world , I think many of us are in our game world , turning into our best version , always and immediately ready to help , persistent in solving the problem . Try trying to solve it as long as necessary after the failure . And in reality 
, if we fail , if we fail , if we encounter obstacles , we often feel different . 
We feel overwhelmed . We feel defeated . We feel threatened . Maybe depressed , frustrated or cynical . These feelings 
we never have . If we play games in games , there are them simply not . 
And that &apos;s what I call &quot; Ph.D. student &quot; wanted to study . 
Why is it in games impossible to think ? You couldn &apos;t just achieve everything . 
How can we make those feelings out of the games come to reality ? 
So I looked at games like World of Warcraft . It &apos;s the ideal environment for playing together to solve problems . 
And I have a few things to say . The epic victories in online worlds as possible . 
So first , if you go into one of these online games , especially World of Warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters ready to play with you a world saving mission and do it immediately . 
But not just any mission , but a mission that &apos;s perfect for your current level . In the game , it &apos;s 
right . So you can do that . 
You never get a task that you don &apos;t have the ability to solve . 
But always on the edge of your skills . So you have to make an effort . 
But there &apos;s no unemployment in the World of Warcraft . You don &apos;t sit around and turn around and you turn around . There are always targeted things that are important to do . And 
there are , in a way , 
employees wherever they go . Hundreds of thousands of people working with them to get their epic mission done . 
That &apos;s what we have in real life . Not so easy , that feeling that if you have fingerprints , people are willing to have hands on . 
There &apos;s also this epic story . This inspiring story of why we &apos;re there . And what we do is then what we get this whole whole positive feedback . 
You &apos;ve certainly got from level up . And 1 strength heard , or 1 intelligence . 
This constant feedback is not there in the real world . 
If I &apos;m leaving this stage , I don &apos;t have 1 speech and 1 crazy idea . 20 crazy idea . 
I get in real life . 
This feedback , not . So the problem of collaborative online worlds like World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying . Anytime on the edge of an epic victory , that we prefer to stand on the edge of these games all the time . 
They &apos;re just better than reality . 
So far , all of the World of Warcraft players together have 5.93 million years spent on virtual problems of Azeroth , 
and they &apos;ve been doing it for the last five 
years . This is not necessarily a bad thing . 
It may sound bad . But to put it in context , it might sound bad 5.93 million years ago . Our first primate ancestors started walking upright . 
The first upright primacy . 
So OK . So if we talk about how much time we currently spend with games , right ? Does that make sense ? When do you spend time with regard to time on the scale of human development ? In mind what &apos;s extraordinary , 
but also appropriate . Because it turns out that we have to do this by doing this all the time playing . In fact , changing what we as humans do is change what 
we are able to do . We develop into a community . Thinking , heartfelt beings . 
That &apos;s the truth . That &apos;s what I believe in . 
Look at this interesting statistic , which is recently published by a researcher of Carnegie Mellon University , published . The average young person today in the middle of a country with a strong playing culture spends 10,000 hours playing online until they reach the age of 21 . 
So 10,000 hours is a very , very interesting number of two reasons . 
First of all , for kids in the United States , 10,080 hours is . The exact total time they spend in school is about the exact five @-@ grade period , from the high school to the high school level . If you never miss it , 
so we have a complete parallel education path here , where young people learn the same way . What it means is a good player to be like anything else , whatever they do in school , And maybe 
some of you have that new book from Malcolm , Gladwell , flying over . So you know his theory of success . The theory of success of 10,000 dollars of success . 
It &apos;s based on great research , cognitive science , that if we do 10,000 hours of learning with laborious study of any subject , up to the age of 21 , we will master it . 
We will be so good at doing whatever we can , whatever the most important people of the world . 
So what we have here is a complete generation of young people . The master players are 
the big ones . Question : So what ? Exactly , are players masterful ? Good 
. Because if we figure out that out , we would never have been able to have the human potential we could have known 
before . So many people do we have in the world right now , who have at least an hour a day playing online ? These 
are our master players , 500 million people , who are exceptionally good at something . 
And next decade , we have a further billion players , who are exceptionally good at what &apos;s going on . 
If you &apos;re not heard yet , 
the gaming industry has developed . Consoles , saving energy and on mobile networks , instead of broadband Internet . So players on the whole world , especially India . China , Brazil , playing online , 
you can expect . An additional billion players next decade are expected . 
So we &apos;ve got a total of 1 . Five billion players . 
So I started to think about what it is . What these games are to make us master of . 
Here are the four things I do find . First , urgency optimism . 
OK . Imagine if that &apos;s extreme self @-@ motivation . 
Urgent optimism is desire to do something right away . A hurdle to master , along with faith that we have a well @-@ founded hope of success . 
Players always believe that a epic is an possible victory , and that it &apos;s always possible and worthwhile to try and do it . 
And that &apos;s the same : Players don &apos;t sit around . 
Players are masters in spiders . Poet social networks . 
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research . They show that we people like more after we &apos;re having them play , right ? Even if they &apos;re defeating us badly . 
The reason for that is that it &apos;s a lot of trust that requires someone to play a game . 
We trust that somebody will have time with us , that people will respect the rules , that we will have the same goal , and that we will stay with them until the end of the game . 
So that allows interaction , the growth of ties , trust and mutual trust as a result . 
That &apos;s what we &apos;re building stronger social relationships , happy 
productivity . Fantastic . 
You know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of Warcraft player is 22 hours a week . So as part @-@ time job . 
The reason is that if we play , we &apos;re actually happier at it , working hard . As if we relax or nothing , or we do nothing , 
we know that we as human beings function optimally . If we do hard , significant work 
and players are always ready , hard to work . If they do the right job and 
eventually get epic meaning , 
players love it , part awe . Command missions of planetary proportions . 
Here &apos;s a background information to get the right light . You probably know all Wikipedia . The biggest Wiki in the world . The 
second largest Wiki in the world , with almost 80,000 entries , is : The World of Warcraft Wiki : 
Five million people use it every month . 
They have more information about World of Warcraft at the Internet , than they have about any other topic . In any other Wiki in the world . 
They create an epic story . 
They create an epic source of knowledge about the World of Warcraft . 
OK . These are four superpowers , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single result . Players are super @-@ powerful , hopeful individuals . 
They &apos;re people who believe they &apos;re considered as individuals to be changing the world . 
And the only problem is that they believe . They can transform the virtual worlds , but not the real worlds . 
That &apos;s the problem I have to solve . 
Edward Castronova is a scientist . 
His work is brilliant . 
He &apos;s looking at why . People have so much time , energy and money in online worlds . 
And he says , &quot; We are witnessing no less than a mass emigration into virtual worlds and online gaming environments . &quot; 
And that from an economist , so he &apos;s logical . 
And he doesn &apos;t say the way I do . I develop games . I &apos;m a little bit exuberant . 
So he says , &quot; That actually makes sense . &quot; Because players can play more online worlds than they can in real life . 
They can play stronger social ties in games than they do in real life . They get more feedback and rewards in games than they get in real life . 
So he says , &quot; It &apos;s perfectly logical right now that players have more time in the virtual world than in real life . 
&quot; I &apos;m going to agree . This is logical . 
But it &apos;s definitely . No optimal situation . 
We have to start to build the real world into a game . 
My inspiration comes from an event . The 2,500 years back . 
There are these ancient cubes . Sheepcrumbs , you know , in front 
of these fantastic game econtrollers , there were sheep &apos;s cocks . 
And these were , so to speak , the first game tools that humans developed . And if you &apos;re working with the works of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus , you know , you might know this story . The story about how and why games were invented . 
According to Herodotus , games became more accurate cube games in the kingdom of Lydia during famine . 
Allegedly , there was such a great famine that the king of Lydia was too famine to become a crazy idea . 
People suffered the people , people fought . 
It was an extreme situation . It took an extreme solution . 
So they invented it . According to Herodotus , the craps game , and they agreed a national strategy . On one day , you would eat . The next day , you would play and they would play so much into the craps game , 
and they would be so deeply immersed . There , games are so fascinating and we &apos;re happy with satisfactory , happy productivity that they would forget that there &apos;s nothing to eat . 
And then the next day , you would play . And the next day , you would eat . 
And according to Herodotus , they survived for 18 years this famine by surviving on a farm day , eating . And the next day 
, I think so . Let &apos;s play games today . 
We put games in order to alleviate the suffering of the real world . We put games in order to do away with everything that &apos;s in the real world that &apos;s not working . Everything that &apos;s in real life that &apos;s not satisfying . And we get what we need . From the games . 
But that doesn &apos;t have to be the end . 
That &apos;s the exciting thing . 
According to Herodotus , after 18 years of famine , famine didn &apos;t get any better . So the king decided one last cube game . 
They shared the kingdom in two halves . 
They played a cube game . And the winners were allowed to become an epic adventure . 
They left lydia and they got up to search for a crack new home . They just let so many people go back as they made food to survive and they were looking for the rest for a neighborhood in which they could thrive , and they were looking for a place where they could thrive . 
That sounds crazy , right ? 
But the latest DNA evidence shows that the Etruscans , who later became the Roman Empire , are the Etruscans . The same DNA as the old Lydier has . 
So scientists recently came to the conclusion that herodotus is actually crazy history . 
And geologists found evidence of global cooling that is almost 20 years long . What famine explains could explain , 
so this crazy story could be true . Maybe 
they actually have their people through games saved by playing by getting 18 years of fun in games , and they &apos;ve been doing it for the last 18 years . And then this inspiration had , and so much about coexistence , and learning about how to play together , that it saved the whole civilization . 
So , we can . 
We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft since 1994 . 
This was the first strategy game in real time , the World of Warcraft series . 
This was 16 years ago . 
They played 18 years . Craps . We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft for 16 years . 
I &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game . 
So they sent half of their civilization to the search for the search for a new world . So I &apos;m taking my 21 billion hours of play a week . We should agree that the half of the world is one hour 
per day with games , and we should agree that we &apos;re going to spend the day with games until we &apos;ve solved the problems of 
the real world . I know . You &apos;ll ask , &quot; How do we solve problems of the real world in games ? &quot; 
And that &apos;s exactly the question I &apos;ve got my work on . In the last few years at the Institute for the Future . 
We &apos;ve dedicated this banner to our office in Palo Alto . It expresses how we can define the future . 
We don &apos;t want to try to predict the future before 
what we want is the future . 
We want to create the best possible outcome , and then we want to empower people to do it . This idea , into reality . 
We face epic victories . We give ourselves to people who have the opportunity to reach them . 
I &apos;m going to show you three games very briefly that I designed to try and try to make people epic victories in their own future , in my own right . 
This is the world without oil . 
The game is from 2007 . 
It &apos;s an online game where you can see an oil shortage . 
Oil shortages are invented . But we have enough online content to make it realistic for you and you can really make your real life without oil , actually . So if you &apos;re playing , if you sign up , tell us where you live . And then you get news films in real time that show you . How much oil does it cost , which is not there ? How does food supply affect , 
how does transport affect , whether schools are closed . Whether it &apos;s riots . And you have to figure out how to make your real life . If it were true , and we ask you to blog about it , videos or photos . 
We have this game with 1,700 , and we played in 2007 . And we &apos;ve been testing it since then over the last three years . 
And I can tell you , it was a changing experience . 
Nobody wants to change their lives because it &apos;s good for the environment . Or ? Because we should . 
But if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and you &apos;re told , &quot; Get us , oil is out . 
&quot; That &apos;s a fascinating adventure that we can go on . 
Find out how you survive . Most of our players have the ones in the game that have kept the habits that we learned . So we &apos;ve 
chosen to go for the next world saving game . A bigger , higher goal than just oil shortages . 
We &apos;ve got the Superstruct game at the Institute for the Future . 
The starting point is to calculate a supercomputer that people only have 23 years left to work on the planet . 
This supercomputer is called the Global Dismortality Sensitization System , of course , 
the call to players to sign up . Do we have almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie ? 
You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies , where it &apos;s the dream team . You have the astronaut , the scientist , the ex @-@ Sträfling , and only together can you save the world . 
But in our game , instead of just five people , we say , &quot; Everyone &apos;s on the dream team . &quot; And it &apos;s our job to build the future for energy , food , health , safety . And the future of social justice , to create 
. 8,000 players played that game . Eight weeks . 
They found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they read about . If you Google Superstruct and 
the last game bring us to the 3rd of March . It &apos;s a game in collaboration with the World Bank . 
If you play that game , you get from the World Bank the award of social transformers , 2010 graduation . 
We work with universities all over Sub @-@ Saharan Africa and invite them to redesign socially , learn how to do it . 
We have a comic book on that . We have levels high for regional understanding , knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and ingenuity . 
I want to invite you all to play this game with young people . Everywhere on Earth , especially in the development areas , that benefit from this , together , sharing their own social ventures to imagine the world to 
save . I &apos;m going to finish now . 
I want to ask you something . 
What do you think is going to happen next ? 
We have all these fantastic players . We have games that show us what we &apos;re going to do . But we have the real world , not yet saved . 
Well , I hope you &apos;ll tell me that players agree that human resources are the human resources that we need to work in real life and that games are a big deal of importance for change . 
We have all these superpowers , happy productivity , the ability to have tight social networks , urgency optimism , and the desire for epiepical meaning . 
I really hope that together we will have important games to play in this planet . Another century to survive . 
And I hope you will join me in playing these games and playing them . 
When I go to the next decade , I &apos;m looking forward to two things : That we can build every imaginable future , and that we can create all kinds of games . So I say , &quot; Let &apos;s start the world @-@ changing games . 
&quot; Thank you . 
For some time now , I &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect . It may seem strange that a game magician is interested in it . It &apos;s not unless you look at it . Just as I think it &apos;s a deception that leads to something real . If someone is stuck with it , just believing it , 
in other words , that sugar pills have . In some studies , a measurable effect has been shown to have the placebo effect , just because the person thinks what to do with it is a pharmaceutical or some kind of in pain management . For example , if the patient is only firmly enough to get stuck with it , there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect . 
A deception becomes something real because it &apos;s something that someone perceives so that we can 
trust each other to understand each other , and I want to give you a basic , very simple magic trick . 
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . This is a trick that has been around for at least the 1950s in every magic book . For kids , I say , &quot; 
I myself have it from the Cub Scout Magic . &quot; The scout scout in the 1970s . 
I &apos;m going to do it for you , and then explain it . 
And then I &apos;m going to explain why I explain it . 
So you see what happens . 
The knife you &apos;re able to look at . My hand you &apos;re able to look at . 
I &apos;m going to just do the knife like this . In my fist , I &apos;m 
going to push my sleeves back . 
And to make sure that nothing in my sleeves disappears or disappears from it , I &apos;m just going to get my wrist . Right here . 
Put it together in this way , you can see that at no time is anything moving . As long as I &apos;m pressurizing here , nothing can go into my sleeves or come out . 
And the goal ? And the simple thing is . 
I &apos;m going to open my hand . And hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife will go through my bare physical magnetism . 
It &apos;s actually so firmly stuck on its place that I can shake it without it shaking , without the knife falling down , nothing wanders 
into my sleeve , or comes out , no trickery . And you can study everything . 
TA @-@ DA : 
Now , this is a trick I often use to teach small kids who are looking for magic . Because you can do a lot about deception , because you can learn a lot about deception . If you look more closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick to do . 
I think many of you here probably know about this in the room . This trick . 
It works like this . 
I think the knife is . In my hand . 
I say I &apos;m going to close my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or comes out . And that &apos;s a lie . 
The reason I &apos;m going to tie my wrist is because it &apos;s the real secret of the illusion . 
In the moment that I &apos;m going to shake my hand away from you so that you can see it from behind , this finger moves . Here &apos;s my index finger just from where it was , into a position where it was so stretched 
out , great 
trick . There &apos;s somebody sitting back there who 
had no childhood . So he &apos;s here right there . 
And if I turn around , the finger changes its position . 
And now you could talk about it . Why that ? A deception is why you don &apos;t realize that down here , only three fingers are visible . Because the mind and the way that it sees information , it doesn &apos;t count individually . One , two , three , but it sees it as a group . 
But that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about . Now , actually , here , not at all . And then open . I mean , hand . 
Of course , it &apos;s held there . But not by magnetism of my body , but by a trick . By my index finger , which is there now . 
And when I put my hand on , the same thing happens by turning back , it &apos;s hidden by this movement that the finger moves back . 
I take this hand away . And here &apos;s the knife . 
This trick you can use to get your friends and neighbors to do . Thank you . 
Now , what does this have with the placebo effect ? 
Well , a year ago or so , I read a study that really cut me around . 
I &apos;m not a doctor , right ? Researchers , and that &apos;s why for me , this was an amazing thing . 
It turned out to be the following . If you have a placebo in the form of a white pill , in the form . An aspirin tablet is just a round white pill , which is a certain measurable effect . 
But if you have the shape in which you have the placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , change it . And this blue color and a letter on it is the color of the pill , actually measurably more effective . 
And that , though none of these are any pharmaceutical . They &apos;re just sugar pills , 
but a white pill is not so good as a blue pill . 
What that made me really freak out of it . 
It turned out , however , that this hasn &apos;t all happened yet . 
If you take capsules , they &apos;re even more effective than tablets . Any form , 
a colored capsule , that &apos;s yellow at one end . And on the other side , red is better than a white capsule . The 
dosage also plays a role . 
A pill twice a day is not so good as three pills . I can now &apos;t get to the exact statistics that I remember . 
Does I &apos;m sorry about 
the crucial thing , but is that the dosage also 
plays a role ? And the shape plays a role . 
And if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to grab the needle . 
Right ? A syringe with an ineffective one . A few milliliters , an ineffective substance you can give to a patient . 
That creates a very strong image in your head . This is a much stronger picture . 
It &apos;s a white pill . This graph is really . I &apos;m going to give you another example . If we have a projector , so 
the fact is that the white pill isn &apos;t so good as the blue pill , the one that doesn &apos;t work so well . It &apos;s like a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle , 
and it doesn &apos;t have any of these really pharmaceutical properties . It &apos;s just our belief in it , which is stronger in us than it is in us . 
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a magic trick . 
I take something that obviously is a deception , and I let it look real . 
We know from that study that we can say you can grab a needle . If it &apos;s going to go to the point , 
this is a 18 @-@ inch @-@ long needle . It &apos;s very , very sharp . And I &apos;m going to start by doing a little sterilizing it . 
This is really my flesh . It &apos;s not Damian &apos;s special farmed meat . 
This is my skin . This is not a special effect . Hollywood : 
I &apos;m going to now put this needle in my skin and through it I &apos;m going to drive it through until it &apos;s on the other side . 
Again , leaving . If you &apos;re going to get bad when you &apos;re easily fainting . I have this a couple of friends . Last night in the hotel room , I showed this to some people I didn &apos;t know . And there &apos;s a woman almost fainthearted , and 
she &apos;s been fainthearted . I &apos;m suggesting , if you can quickly get bad at it . Then look for the next 30 or so seconds away . Or , you know what ? I &apos;m going to take the first delicate part back here . 
You can do it in a moment . You can see it away , but you can also look away . If you want , 
so it &apos;s going to be right here where my meat starts . Down there , at the bottom of my arm , I &apos;m just going to do a little bit of 
a little bit of a while . Do I really regret ? Do you crazy about that ? 
And now , just a little bit through my skin . And on the other side , again , 
out again , now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we &apos;re in with the knife trick . 
About . 
But now you can put my fingers out . Or so I 
&apos;m going to show you . This is one , two , three , four , five . 
Well , 
I know what people are thinking . If you see that , 
you say , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s probably not so stupid . &quot; And it goes through itself , the skin just to give us a few minutes to entertain . 
Well , then I &apos;ll show you . 
What does this look like ? Very good . 
Yes . I know . And people in the back say , &quot; Okay , I didn &apos;t really see that . People 
in the adjoining rooms are now coming in . &quot; Let &apos;s 
let me tell you from near . This is 
really my skin . This is not a special effect . 
Hollywood . This is my flesh . And I can turn this around . Do 
I &apos;m sorry ? If you &apos;re getting bad , look away . Look away . Don &apos;t look at the back . 
Or those who will see this on video at some point in the future will say : Well , yes . That looks pretty impressive . But if it were real , he would see . You see , here &apos;s a hole . And there , if it were really real , it would bleed . Okay . 
Let me just take a little blood for you . 
Yes . Here it is . 
Normally I would now put out the needle . 
I would take my arm out and show you that there &apos;s no wounds there . 
But I think in this frame here and with the intention of getting out of a deception something real , I &apos;m going to take the needle there just to leave it there . And so , from the stage , 
we &apos;re going to go in the next few days , a few times . 
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . Thank you very much . 
So I &apos;ve got a lot of fish in my life . 
I &apos;ve only loved two . 
This first one , which was more like a passionate affair . 
It was a beautiful fish , tasty , good consistency , rich , a bestseller on the menu . 
What a fish , 
even better . It got aquaculture after aquaculture , supposedly the highest standards of sustainability , bred . 
You could , therefore , feel comfortable with it selling it . 
I had this beauty , a relationship over several months . 
One day , the boss of the company called and asked if I was going to be speaking at an event about sustainability of the farm . 
Of course , I said , 
&quot; Here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem for our chefs had become . How do we keep fish on our menus ? 
In the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the seas , how we &apos;ve been barking forests . 
It &apos;s hard to destroy , overstate . 
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the curative butte , the salmon , the swordfish . They &apos;ve collapsed . 
It &apos;s almost nothing left . 
So I think it &apos;s going to be aquaculture , or bad aquaculture , fishing . Part of our future will 
be many arguments against it polluting fishing facilities . The environment , most of you anyway , and you &apos;re inefficient . Let &apos;s take tuna , a big disadvantage . 
It has feed recovery of 15 percent to one . 
That means 15 pounds of wild fish are needed to make a pound of farmed tuna . 
Not very sustainable tastes 
, not very good either . 
So here was finally a company . It tried to get it right . 
I wanted to support them 
the day before . The event , I called the head of public relations for the company . 
Let &apos;s call him . Don . 
Don . I just said , &quot; Just for the facts . &quot; Right ? Have you been famous for going so far outside the sea to grow you that you &apos;re not polluting 
the environment ? That &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; We &apos;re so far outside that the waste is from our fish distributed , not concentrated . And 
then he added . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re basically our own world . 
This feed recovery of 2.5 to 1 &quot; he said , 
&quot; The best in the industry is 
2.5 to one . 
Great 2.5 to one . What &apos;s feeding ? &quot; 
&quot; Your sustainable proteins , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Great . &quot; I said , &quot; I got up , 
and that evening I lay in bed thinking , &quot; What the hell is a sustainable protein ? 
&quot; So I called the next day , just before the event , Don . 
I said , &quot; Don , what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot; 
He said he knew he didn &apos;t know . He would ask . 
Well , I telephoned with a few people in the company . Nobody could tell me a good answer until I finally got to the senior biologist on the phone . 
Let &apos;s call him another . Don . Don . 
Don , I said , &quot; What , for example , are sustainable ? &quot; 
Proteins . Well , he mentioned some algae and some fishmeal . And then he said chicken pellets . 
I said chicken pellets . He 
said , &quot; Yes , feathers . &quot; Skin , bone meal , leftovers dried and processed into food . 
I said , &quot; How much percent of your ? &quot; Futters is chicken in the 
assumption of maybe two percent . 
Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said . 
I said , &quot; Don . &quot; &quot; What &apos;s sustainable about it ? Chicken feeding fish ? &quot; 
There was a long break in the pipeline . And he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chicken on the planet . 
I fell in love with that fish . 
No . Not because I was a self @-@ righteous connoisseur and a good man . 
That &apos;s me . Even 
no . I &apos;m not really impressed by this fish because I swear I swear to God , &quot; The fish after this conversation , after having tasted chicken . 
&quot; This second fish . This is another species of love story . 
It &apos;s the romantic species , the species where you ever ever better love your fish , the better you know your fish . You learn the fish . 
The more you love it . I love it first in a restaurant in southern Spain . 
A friend journalist had long been talking about this fish . She told us , 
in a way , it cuffed us . 
He came up on the table with a bright one . Almost shimmering white color . 
The cook had cooked it . 
Hold twice . 
Amazingly , he was still delicious . 
Who can buy a fish so good ? After he was cooked ? 
I can &apos;t . But this guy can . 
Let &apos;s call him Miguel . In fact , he &apos;s called Miguel . 
And no . He has the fish not cooked . And he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way they do . And I understand it . 
He &apos;s a biologist at Veta la Palma . 
This is a fish rearing in the southwest corner of Spain . 
It &apos;s near the mouth of the river Guadalquivir , right 
down to the 1980s . The farm in the hands of Argentines , 
they grew meat cattle on what was basically what wetlands were . 
They did this by doing the land drainage . 
They built this complicated sequence of canals and they pushed water , they pushed water out of the country and out into the river . 
Now , they couldn &apos;t make it work , they couldn &apos;t work economically 
and ecologically , it was a disaster . 
It brought about 90 percent of the birds around , which is the place for many birds . 
And so 1982 , a Spanish company with environmental awareness , the country bought . 
What did they do ? 
They did the river of water reverse . 
They literally did the lever . 
Instead of pushing out the water , they used the channels to get the water back . Put it in . 
They flooded the channels . 
They created an 11,000 acres . Fish farming , perch , sea ash , shrimp . Eel , and Miguel . And his company , the ecological destruction , completely reversed . 
The farm is incredible . 
I mean , you have something like this never seen before . You &apos;re 
staring out onto the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see is flooded . Channels . And this dense , lush march . 
I was there , not long ago , with Miguel . 
He &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts . Charles Darwin and one part , a crocodile for kissing . 
Okay . There we were and we fought through the wetlands . And I chash and sweat , I have mud up to my knees . And Miguel keeps calm . A biology lecture . 
Here he lifts a rare track car . 
Now he mentions mineral needs of phytoplankton . 
And here . Here he sees a pattern of bundles that he &apos;s looking at in Tanzanian giraffe . 
It turns out that Miguel has the biggest part of his career in Mikumi National Park in Africa , in Africa . 
I asked him how he was going to be a fish expert . 
He said , &quot; Fish . I don &apos;t know about fish . &quot; 
I &apos;m an expert in relationships . And 
then he goes and falls and falls into more talk of rare birds and algae and algae . And strange aquatic plants . 
And you know , don &apos;t get me wrong . That was really fascinating . You know , the biotic community , unplugged . So , in the way 
it &apos;s great . But I was in love . 
And my head got weak over this cooked piece . Delicious fish that I had on the eve . 
So I got him interrupted . I said , Miguel . How is it that your fish is so tasty ? He 
pointed to algae . 
I know boy , the algae of phytoplankton , the relationships . That &apos;s incredible . 
But what do your fish eat ? 
How is the recycling of feed ? Well 
, he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that it &apos;s the fish that eat what they eat in the wild , and it &apos;s 
the fish that eat . The vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton . That &apos;s what the fish feed . 
The system is so healthy . It &apos;s completely self @-@ explanatory . 
There &apos;s no food . 
The way a farm owns its own animals is that it doesn &apos;t feed its animals . 
Later on the day I drove on this plot with Miguel around . And I asked him . I said , &quot; For a place that &apos;s so natural , it seems different from any farm on which I ever have been . How do you measure success ? &quot; 
In the moment , it was as if a film director was demanding a stage change . 
And we bowed around the corner and us offered ourselves the opportunity for the most incredible sight . Thousands and thousands of pinkers flamingos . A literally pinker carpet . So far as the eye can see . 
This is success . He said . 
&quot; Look at their bellies . Look at pink . 
&quot; They &apos;re slugging , slugging 
. I was completely confused . 
I said , &quot; Miguel , don &apos;t sludge your fish . &quot; 
Yes , he said , &quot; We &apos;re losing . 
&quot; 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs , to birds . 
Now , last year , on this plot , 600,000 birds were more than 250 different species . 
It &apos;s today the largest . And one of the most important private bird reserves in Europe . 
I said , Miguel is a good thing . A thriving bird population , not . The last thing you can do on a fish farm , 
he shook his head . No . 
He said , &quot; We &apos;re building extensively , not intensively . 
This is a green network . 
The flamingos eat . The shrimps . 
The shrimps eat the phytoplankton . 
The closer the belly , the better . &quot; 
The system : Okay . Let &apos;s do a rethink . A farm that has no feeding of its animals and a farm that has its success in health at the hands of its predators . 
A fish rearing , but also a bird reserve . 
Oh . And by the way , these flamingos shouldn &apos;t even be there from the outset . 
They breed in a city 240 kilometers away , where the soil quality is better . For nest maintenance 
every morning , they fly 240 kilometers to the farm . 
And every night , they fly 240 kilometers back . 
They do that because they &apos;re doing the white line yesterday . The A92 highway 
can follow seriously , seriously . 
I had a kind of journey that penguins had imagined . So I looked at Miguel . 
I said , Miguel , fly 240 kilometers to the farm and fly them . Then 240 kilometers back in the evening 
. Make that for the kids . He 
looked at me as if I had just heard a song from Whitney Houston . 
He said , &quot; No . &quot; &quot; You do that because the food is better . &quot; &quot; 
I don &apos;t have the skin of my beloved fish mentioned . The delicacies were . And I don &apos;t like the skin of fish . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t like it sucked . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t like it crispy . 
&quot; It &apos;s this biting , charred taste . 
I cook almost never with it . And 
yet , when I put it in this restaurant in southern Spain , she even has no idea what it was like to taste fish skin . 
She tasted sweet and pure as if you were eating a bite from the ocean . 
I mentioned that to Miguel . And he nodded . 
He said , &quot; The skin looks like a sponge . 
&quot; It &apos;s the last defense before anything happens in the body . 
It has become more and more evolved over the course of evolution to suck up impurities . And 
then he added , &quot; But our water doesn &apos;t have impurities . Okay 
. A farm that has no fish feeding . A farm that has measured its success in the success of its predators . 
&quot; And then I realized . If he says , &quot; A farm that has no impurities , it undermines enormously . &quot; Because the water that passes through . This farm flows out of the river Guadalquivir , in . 
It &apos;s a river that flows all these things with it . Today , rivers tend to lead them with it . Chemical pollutants . Outflow of pesticides . 
And if it &apos;s through the system , it &apos;s fought , and it &apos;s leaving , the water is cleaner than it &apos;s come in . 
The system is so healthy . It cleans the water . 
So not only a farm that &apos;s cleaning its animals . Not only a farm that &apos;s successful in feeding its animals . It &apos;s a farm that &apos;s literally a water treatment plant , but it &apos;s not just a farm that &apos;s measuring its success in the health of its predators . And not only for these fish , but also for you and me . 
Because if the water flows out , it sinks into the Atlantic , 
a drop in the ocean . I know , but I take it . And that &apos;s what you should do . Because this love story , however romantic , is also instructive . 
You might say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future , good food . Whether we &apos;re eating beef or meat cattle , 
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , of a farm in which food actually is good . 
But for many people , this is a little too radical . 
We &apos;re not realists . We &apos;re eaters . We &apos;re lovers . 
We love weekly markets . We love small family businesses . We talk about local food . We eat . We eat organic . 
And if you claim that &apos;s the things that are the future of good food . Does anybody stand up somewhere and say , &quot; Hey guys , I love pink flamingos . &quot; But how are you going to feed the world ? How 
are you going to feed the world ? 
Can I be honest . 
I like this question . Not . 
No . Not because we already have enough calories to produce the world more than just to feed the world . 
One billion people today will starve , 
one billion . That &apos;s more than ever before . Because of stark inequalities in distribution , not total production . 
Well , I like this question not because it &apos;s the logic of our food system . The last 50 years have 
been over @-@ determined : Feed grain to plant @-@ eaters , pesticides , monocultures , chemicals to the Earth , chicken to fish . And the whole time , the agricultural industry has just asked . If we have more people eating cheaper , how terrible can that be ? That 
was the reason . It was the justification . It was the business plan of American agriculture . 
We should call it what it is . It was a liquidation business , a business that quickly picked up ecological capital , which is what enables that very production . 
That &apos;s not a business . And it &apos;s not agriculture . 
Our grain chamber is threatened today , not because of decreasing supply , but because of decreasing resources , 
not because of the latest Moravian and Tractor inventions , but because of fertile land , not because of pumps , but because of fresh water . Not because of chainsaws , but because of forests . And not because of fishing boats and nets , but because of fish in the sea . They 
want the world to feed . Let &apos;s 
start . Let &apos;s start with the question , &quot; How are we going to feed ourselves ? 
&quot; Or better . How can we create conditions that would create conditions that would enable each community to feed itself ? 
To do that , look , don &apos;t look at the agricultural industrial model for the future . 
It &apos;s really old . And it &apos;s done . 
Capital , chemistry and machines are at the top of it . And it never has anything really good to eat . 
Let &apos;s look instead at the ecological model . 
This is the one that &apos;s on two billion years . Work experience . 
Look at Miguel . Farmers like Miguel : 
Farms that don &apos;t have worlds for themselves , farms that restore . Instead of using up farms that grow extensively , instead of just intensive farmers , who are not just producers , but experts in relationships . 
Because they are the ones who are experts in taste . 
And if I really am honest , they are a better cook . When I ever be , 
you know , you know , that &apos;s right . Because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious . 
Thank you . 
I grew up with a lot of stuff . Science fiction . 
In my school days , I drove by bus to school every day , an hour per way . And my 
nose was always in a book , a science fiction book . That was my thoughts into other worlds , and narratives that took me . My deep inside me , insatiable curiosity satisfied . 
This curiosity was also shown by the fact that whenever I was not in the school , I was always , through the woods , wandering and sampling , collecting frogs and snakes and beetles and pond water . Everything home brought home . And under the microscope , 
I looked at , &quot; I was total . Science enthusiast , 
you know , it was always about trying to get the world to understand and the limits of what could be done . 
And my love of science fiction seemed to have appeared in my surroundings . Because back then , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and we explored the deep sea . 
Jacques Cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating shows , which brought us animals and places and a world full of wonders , which we were previously never going to have imagined . 
This then probably has a very good time for that . Science fiction role . 
And I was an artist . 
I could draw . I could paint . 
And since it &apos;s not video games , nor this saturation , with computer @-@ generated films . Nor the whole visual language in the media landscape was there , I had to put the images in my head . 
That &apos;s what we all had to do at the time . If we were kids , we read a book , we took the author &apos;s description and projected it onto the canvas in our heads . 
My reaction to that was drawing and painting of aliens aliens aliens &apos; worlds , robots , spacecraft . And all of this in math class , 
I was constantly taught by the teacher , like I was hiding behind the textbook . 
Mint around . Creativity had to stop somehow out . 
And it was an interesting thing . What happened to me was , what fascinated me about Jacques Cousteaus &apos; shows was the idea of a world that we had never seen before . Here on our planet . Even certainly 
I would never have a alien world with an alien world with a spaceship . That seemed pretty unlikely to me . 
But here was a world I was actually entering , actually . Here on Earth , and it was just as fascinating and exotic . Like all that I thought I &apos;d ever imagined . When I read these books , 
so I decided , When I was 15 , I decided to become a diver . 
The only problem with this was that I was in a small village in Canada , one thousand kilometers from the nearest ocean , 
And I left myself with no discouragement . 
I was annoying my father until he finally had a diving school in Buffalo , New York , found out . And that &apos;s exactly the other side of the border where we lived . 
I made my diving certificate in a pool called YMCA . Right in the middle of winter in Buffalo , New York , 
the ocean , but I only got a real ocean two years later . When we went to California , 
since then , in the 40 years that have passed , I &apos;ve got about 3,000 hours under water , and I &apos;ve been living in the ocean for a few years . 500 hours of that in submersible boats . 
And I &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea itself is in the flatter oceans so rich in fascinating life , as we have in the deep seas , as we can hardly imagine . The imagination of 
nature doesn &apos;t know any boundaries . It &apos;s quite unlike our own miserable human imagination , 
up to this day , that it &apos;s felt . I have the deepest awe for what I have to see on my dives . 
And my love of the ocean is continuing with the same intensity as ever . 
And ever as I got to be an adult , I chose a profession , it was filmmaking . 
That seemed to be the best way to make my inner urge to tell stories . With my need to create images , 
to unite . As a child , I kept drawing comic books . And so 
, films were the way , pictures and stories were brought together . That fit together . 
Of course , the stories I was choosing were from the science fiction field : Terminator , Aliens and Abyss . At 
Abyss , I could have my preference for the underwater world and diving with filmmaking , 
connecting it to filmmaking . So the sort of two passions that I had intertwined . 
Something interesting happened at Abyss to make a narrative problem in this movie , to solve . And that was , we had to do something like create a liquid water system . Let &apos;s grab computer @-@ generated animation , CG . 
What came out of this was the first computer @-@ generated soft surface figure ever to be seen in a movie . 
The film did not bring money . It was a , to put it mildly , just playing its production costs . But I noticed something fascinating . The audience on the planet was a bit hypnotized by the magic of the magic that 
came out of it . According to Arthur Clarke &apos;s law , advanced technology and magic are no longer mutually distinguishable from each other . 
They saw something magical . 
And that &apos;s what I found incredibly exciting . 
And I thought , wow . That absolutely must be in the art of film . So 
we went to Terminator 2 , my next movie , a lot further . 
Together with ILM , we created the guy there from liquid metal . The success was very much dependent on how this effect would arrive . 
And it worked . Again , we had created something magical . And the effect in the audience was the same . But we did with the film already have a little more money . 
Recorded by these two experiences , the idea was a whole new world . A whole new world of creativity for filmmakers . 
So I started a company with a company , along with my good friend Stan . Winston , who was at that time the best make @-@ up and creature designer , called Digital Domain . 
The basic idea of this company was to start the phase of analog processes with optical printers , etc . , and to jump over to digital productions . 
And we did that , and we managed to create it for a while , 
a competitive advantage . But in the mid @-@ 1990s , we realized that we were in the Creature and Character Design , for which we actually founded the company . Too slowly . 
I had this piece of Avatar written that the bar on the visual effects and computer @-@ generated effects across the whole new heights was supposed to shift . With realistic , human expressive characters that are made using CG , And the main characters were supposed to be all CG . And the world was supposed to be CG . 
But the bar pressed pretty much back . And people in my company said , &quot; Well , for the time being , we haven &apos;t been able to do that . 
So I shifted that , and I did this other movie about the big ship . 
&quot; That goes to the studio , I have that as Romeo and Juliet on a ship , sold it . It became a love movie of epic proportions , a passionate movie , secret 
. But did I actually want to become a real wreck ? The Titanic , dive 
down , so I made the film . 
This is the truth . The studio knew this , but not . I have it , 
but I convinced it by saying , &quot; We dive to the wreck . &quot; We film the real wreck . 
We will do it in the opening sequence of the film . 
This is incredibly important . It &apos;s a good trailer for marketing . And 
I persuaded them to make an expedition finance . 
Sounds crazy . But that &apos;s going to be back to the fact that your imagination creates a reality . 
We then actually created six months later a reality in which we created a reality in which I was found in a Russian submersible , four kilometers below the surface of the North Atlantic , and me the real Titanic . Through a bullet . This was 
not a movie . No HD . This was real . 
So this has really bypassed me 
and the preparations for this were enormous . We had to have cameras and headlights and everything . 
And I fell on how much these deep @-@ sea dive gears resembled a space mission . 
Well , yeah . They were also high @-@ tech and needed extensive planning . 
You go up into this capsule . Then you float into this dark , hostile environment , where no hope for salvation exists , you float down . If you don &apos;t return it yourself . 
And I thought , wow . That &apos;s just as if I were in a science fiction movie . 
That &apos;s really cool . I 
was really obsessed . I was obsessed with exploring the deep sea . 
Anyway , from the part that was curious and science to do with . It was all . It was adventure . It was curiosity . It was imagination . 
And it was an experience that I had not had the ability to give Hollywood . 
Because , you know , I could be imagined as a creature for which we would then have a visual effect . But I could not imagine that . What I could imagine outside the window was 
what I would see . Some of the expeditions that followed , I &apos;ve seen beings in thermal springs . And sometimes things that I &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that I &apos;ve seen before , sometimes things that nobody had ever seen before . And for those who have been science at the time we saw them , none of the 
words found . That &apos;s what really turned me around . And I wanted more . 
And so I met a little bit unusual decision . 
After the success of Titanic , I said to myself , OK . I want to be my main profession as a filmmaker in Hollywood on ice , and I &apos;m going to be a full @-@ time researcher for a while . And 
then we started these expeditions to plan . 
We showed up to Bismarck and we explored them with robotic vehicles . 
We went back to the wreck of the Titanic . 
We took small robots that we built that we had a fiber optic cable . 
Our intention was to dive in and get inside the ship and see what never before has been done . 
Nobody had ever had the inside of the wreck explored . You had not had the tools to do that . So we developed the technology we needed . 
So , what ? There I am now sitting on the deck of the Titanic . In a submersible boat , and I see planks planking these boards quite similar here . And of those I know once that once the band was playing there . 
And I &apos;m flying with a little robot vehicle through the aisles of the ship . 
I &apos;m operating it , actually . But my consciousness is within the vehicle . 
It felt like it was me that I was physically inside the ship wreck of the Titanic . 
That was the surreal form of a déjà vu that I &apos;ve ever experienced . Because before I was asked to go around a corner , I always knew what was going to happen in the light cone of the vehicle . Because I &apos;ve been running over the movie set for months when we shot the film . 
The set was actually a copy of it . The blueprints of the ship . 
This was a very strange experience . 
It made me this telepresence experience realize that you could have such robotic avatars . And so , your consciousness into that vehicle , into that other form of existence . 
It can be laid . It was really incredibly profound , 
and maybe a little bit of a view of what might be happening in a few decades . If you have cyborg bodies to do some research or other things , to do . In all sorts of post @-@ human future scenarios that I think I can imagine as a science fiction fan . 
After these expeditions , we started what we were down there seeing , really appreciated , really learning to learn . For example , these deep sea equals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . These are , kind of , alien animals . But here on Earth . 
They live with the help of chemosynthesis . 
They don &apos;t exist in sunlight . They don &apos;t exist in a system like we do . 
And this is how you see animals right next to a 500 degrees Celsius water cloud living . And 
you can &apos;t imagine that you 
&apos;re there to survive . Same time , I was also interested in being a space scientist . This was again the science fiction influence from my childhood . 
And so I ended up with people who were interested in the space world , and people who were interested in NASA , and who were involved in NASA . And in NASA &apos;s expert council , they were sitting there planning real space missions . They were going to Russia , going through before the mission . Biomedical protocol , including , All around it , they then fly to the International Space Station and take our 3D camera systems with them . 
This was fascinating . 
But at the end of the day , it was like I was going to be a space scientist with us in the deep sea . 
I took them with me and I gave them access to the world . Down there , astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were in the interest of such extreme situations . I took them to the sources with me so that they could look around , take samples and test instruments . And so on . 
We turned documentary films . But actually science , more specifically space science . 
So this is how the circle between my existence as a science fiction fan , then as a child , closed . And the realization into reality . 
Over the course of this discovery journey , I learned a lot . 
I learned a lot about science , a lot . But I also learned a lot about leadership . 
Now , you probably think a director must lead , a director must be able to be like a ship captain or something . 
I understood , but not much about leadership . Before I started these expeditions , 
because I was at a certain point , I had to tell myself , what am I doing here ? 
Why am I doing this ? What &apos;s coming out of this ? These 
stupid movies bring us no money . We &apos;ll just play 
the production costs , one of fame , no trace . 
Everybody thinks I &apos;m between Titanic and Avatar running away and I would have been stuck somewhere on a towel on a beach beach . 
I &apos;ve all made these films , these documentary films for a very small audience . 
No fame , no honor . No money . What are you doing ? 
You &apos;re doing it to the task , to the challenge , for the sake of the challenge . And the ocean is the most challenging environment that exists . You &apos;re doing it to explore . And you &apos;re doing it to discover . And it &apos;s because of the strange connection that emerges when a small group of people form a team . 
Because we have all of this with just 10 to 12 people , who have been doing continuous cooperation for years . Sometimes we &apos;ve been two to three months in a row at sea . 
And in this community , you can see that the most important thing is respect , the respect that you have for each other , because you &apos;ve done a job that you can &apos;t explain to anyone else . 
If you &apos;re going back to land and you say , &quot; We had to do it . &quot; The fiberglass , the sound attenuation and the all around , the whole technology . And the difficulties , the human performance . If you &apos;re working at sea , you can do it to the other person . That &apos;s like policemen or policemen or soldiers who do something in common . And they know they never have somebody explaining it . 
And there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect . 
When I came back to my next movie , Avatar , to try to make the same leadership style , which is that you respect your team and you &apos;re in return for the respect that they deserve . 
And that made the dynamics really 
change . And I stood there again with a little team , unknown . And we turned Avatar with a new technology that it used to be , and it didn &apos;t exist before . 
It was incredibly exciting , 
it was a tremendous challenge . 
And we became a huge challenge for a four and a half years to a real family . 
And that changed my way of making films . 
It changed completely . There were people who thought we had these ocean properties , yeah , really good . And on the planet Pandora . For 
me , it was more a principled way of doing my job . The actual process , which results from change , has changed . 
What can we do from all of this ? 
What lessons do we learn ? I believe in 
first . The first is curiosity . 
It &apos;s the most powerful human property . Our 
imagination is a force that even has a reality to create . 
And respect for your team is more important than all the laurels of the world . 
To me come are young filmmakers who say , Give me a advice on how I can do this kind of thing . And 
I say , &quot; Don &apos;t limit yourself , &quot; which 
is already getting others for you . Do not do it for you . Self bet , not against yourself . But take risks , take risks for you . 
NASA has this kind of favorite sentence . Failure is not an alternative . But 
in art and in exploration , it has to fail . An alternative has to be . Because that &apos;s where it guarantees a benefit of trust . 
No important undertaking . Innovation demanded was ever made without risk , ever approached . 
You have to be ready . Such risks have to be taken on . 
That &apos;s the idea I &apos;m going to share with you on the way . Failure is a very alternative . Fear . But isn &apos;t it ? Thank you . 
If I can give you a little bit of a little bit of a closer today , it &apos;s that the whole data we consume is larger than the sum of their parts . And instead of overloading information , instead of thinking about overloading information , I want you to think about how we can use information to create patterns and we can trends like this that otherwise don &apos;t appear visible , otherwise . 
So what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical death chart based on age . 
The program I &apos;m using here is a little experiment . 
It &apos;s called Pivot . And what I &apos;m doing with Pivot is that I &apos;m going to be able to filter for a certain cause of death . Let &apos;s say accidents , 
and I &apos;ll see another pattern immediately , which emerges . 
And that &apos;s because in the middle , here , people are most active . And you over here , they &apos;re most frail . 
We can take a step further out and sort out the data , then look again , and see that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everybody . 
If we go further and age @-@ sort them , we say 40 years or younger , we see accidents even happening , the main cause of which is the people are worried about , 
and we see that they &apos;re not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to And who &apos;s going to study it ? See , this is particularly true for men . 
You can see , then , that the image of information and data in this way is very much swimming in a living information graph . 
And if we think about raw data , why not ? Why not content itself ? 
What we &apos;re having here is the cover images . Each and every one of the Sports Illustrated people who have ever been printed . 
It &apos;s all here . It &apos;s all online . 
You can like to do it after I gave my talk in your rooms . 
With Pivot , you can dive into a decade . 
You can dive into a given year . 
You can dive directly to a particular issue . 
If I &apos;m looking here , I see the athletes who are in this issue . And the sports , 
I &apos;m a lance . Armstrong . Fan . So I click here to see what all the issues show me in which Lance Armstrong mentions are mentioned . 
Now , if I just take a bigger look at this , I could think . OK . What if I could do everything with the theme of cycling ? So 
I &apos;m going to take a step back and expand the perspective . 
Now I &apos;m looking at Greg Lemon . 
And so you get an idea of the idea that if you look at this kind of information , more targeted , wider , more pure , zooming out . Then you don &apos;t look for or surf . Not just . 
You do something that is actually a little different . 
It &apos;s something in between . And we think it changes the way that you do information . 
I want to use this idea a little bit more , with something like what a little crazy is . 
What we did here is we did . We have every single wikipedia page , and we put it in a little summary . 
The summary contains a quick overview , and a symbol of the area from which you can come . 
I &apos;m just going to show you the top 500 of the most popular wikipedia pages . 
But even in this narrow view , we can see a lot of things . 
Immediately , we get an idea of the issues that are on Wikipedia most popular . 
I &apos;m going to talk about government now . 
Now , after I &apos;ve elected government , I realize that the Wikipedia categories that are most concerned with this are Time Magazines , people of the year . 
This is really important . Because this is a realization that is not in a single Wikipedia page . 
This is just to be seen . If you take a step back , and look at the whole thing , 
look at a particular one . These summaries , can I then go into the theme of Time Magazines , &quot; People of the Year ? &quot; And all together , when 
I look at all these people , I see that the people in the majority of them are government officials . Some of them come from science . Some of them come from economics , even less . Here &apos;s my boss . And one comes from music . 
And interestingly , Bono is also a TED Prize winner . 
So we can jump and win a look at everybody TED Prize . 
You see , we surf the web . The first time , it &apos;s like it &apos;s really a web . Not only from side to side , but it &apos;s much more abstract . 
And so I want to show you something else that a little surprise might be . 
I &apos;m going to just show you the New York Times website . 
Pivot , this application . I want it not to be called a browser . It &apos;s really not a browser . But you can use it to look at websites . And we bring this zoom technology to every single website like this . 
I can , therefore , go back a step and go straight to a specific section . 
This is important because you only need to go through looking at websites in this way , and you can do all the Internet history in the same way , 
looking at the web pages . I can , therefore , zoom in into 
my course , in a certain time frame . Here &apos;s the state of play of the entire demonstration that I &apos;ve kept going up to now . 
And I can sort of do everything I &apos;ve seen so far . I can get back . 
And if I get back a step and get back on everything , I can get back to my course . Maybe arrange for my search past . Here I am , looking for nepotistic . Here &apos;s Bing , right ? Here &apos;s live . Labs Pivot And 
from here , I can go to the page and put it back on . 
It &apos;s a metaphor that keeps coming to use . And every time it does the overall picture . Bigger than the sum of the data pieces 
right now in this world . Let &apos;s think that data is a curse . 
We talk about the curse of the abundance of information . 
We talk about drowning in information . 
What if we were to turn this situation around and turn the Internet upside down , like this , so instead of always being from one to the other , instead of always starting to move from one thing to another , we could go from many things to many things . And by doing this , we could see patterns that would otherwise have been hidden . 
If we did this , then it will be this data trap that we &apos;ve seen so far , maybe a new source of meaningful information . 
And instead of just just getting information , instead of just moving around , we can get knowledge from it . 
And if we know , then we can maybe even learn wisdom from it . 
So I stop . Thank you very much . 
Everybody &apos;s talking today about happiness . 
I have some people , the number of books , counting the number of books that are entitled &quot; Happiness &quot; in the title , published over the last five years . And they gave up after about 40 . And there were a lot more . 
There &apos;s a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers . 
There &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching . 
Everybody would like to make people happier . 
But despite all this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps that make it kind of impossible , so to speak . Sure about thinking about happiness . 
And my talk today is mostly about these cognitive traps , which will act . 
That &apos;s true for laymen who are talking about their own happiness . And it &apos;s true for scientists who are thinking about happiness . Because it turns out that we &apos;re just as confused as everybody else . 
The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity . 
It turns out that this word is happiness , just not a useful word anymore . Because we put it on too many different things . 
I think there &apos;s a certain meaning to which we apply it to , you know ? But in the end , that &apos;s something that we give up , and it &apos;s something that we need to give up . And we &apos;re going to get the complicated view . We need to think about what well @-@ being is . 
The second case is confusion between what experience is and memory is . Basically , it &apos;s between happiness , being happy in his life and being happy about his life or being happy with his life . 
And these are two very different concepts . And they &apos;re both thrown together in the idea of happiness . 
And the third is the concentration illusion . And that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we don &apos;t have a circumstance to think about . Well @-@ being affects without affecting its meaning . 
I mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive trap . 
There &apos;s just no way . It &apos;s right to get it right . 
Now I &apos;d like to take an example from someone who &apos;s going to have a question @-@ and @-@ answer session . After one of my lectures , which was a story , it was unclear . He said he had a symphony heard . And it was absolutely wonderful music . And it was at the very end of the recording , there was a terrible , creeping sound . 
And then he added , &quot; Really , quite emotional . &quot; That &apos;s got all the experience ruined . 
But that &apos;s not 
what it had ruined . The memories of the experience were . 
He had had the experience . 
He had 20 minutes of wonderful music . 
They didn &apos;t count because he had a memory that he had stayed with . The memory was ruined . And the memory was everything he had to keep to . 
What this really tells us is that we talked about ourselves and about others , and about other people . In the sense of two kinds of self . 
There &apos;s an enlivening self that is in the present . And the present knows is capable of the past , of experiencing it again . But basically , only the present has 
it , it &apos;s the living self , the doctor prides itself . You know , if the doctor asks , &quot; Is it hurting now ? &quot; If I can touch you here . And 
then there &apos;s a memory self . And the memory self is that , which micks . And the story of our life keeps up . And it &apos;s the one that the doctor speaks to by touching the question . How did you feel at home recently ? Or 
what was your journey to Albania or something like that ? 
These are two very different units . The living self . And the remembering self . And the two to be confused is part of the coexistence of the term happiness . 
Well , the remembering self is a storyteller . 
And that really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memories . It starts immediately . 
We don &apos;t just tell stories . If we remember it , stories become stories . 
Our memory tells us stories . That means what we &apos;re told about our experiences is that what we can keep is a story . 
And let &apos;s not be surprised by an example . 
There &apos;s an old study . 
These are real patients who are one of the most painful procedures . 
I &apos;m not going to go into detail . It &apos;s not anymore painful today . But it was painful . When this study was done in the 1990s , 
they were asked to do it every 60 seconds , every 60 seconds . And 
here are two patients . These are their records . 
And they &apos;re asked , who of both has suffered more ? And 
this is a very simple question . 
Patient B clearly has suffered more . His intestinal reflection was longer . And every minute of pain . Patient A had had patient B had patient B and more . 
But now there &apos;s another question : How much did you think ? These patients that they suffered ? And 
here &apos;s a surprise . And 
the surprise is that patient A has a much worse memory of patient A , a much worse memory of intestinal reflection . As patient B , 
the stories of intestinal reflections were different . And because a very critical part of the story is how you end . 
And none of these stories is very edifical or great . But one of them is this : Clear . But one of them is significantly worse than the other , 
and the one that is worse was the one where the pain was all at the end of its peak , at the end of it . It &apos;s a bad story . 
How do we know that ? 
Because we &apos;re looking at these people for their spinal reflections , and much later . How bad was the whole thing overall ? And 
it was much worse for A than for B in B in memory . 
Well , this is a direct conflict between the living self and the remembering . Even 
from the perspective of the living self , B clearly had a worse time . 
Now , what you do with patient A ? And we actually have clinical experiments . And it &apos;s been done . And it works . You could actually do the intestinal reflection of patient A by extending just the tube in it by leaving it . Without too much on it to shake . 
That &apos;s going to make the patient suffer , but only one little bit and much less than before . 
And if you do that for a few minutes , you have done it to make the living self of patient A worse off than that . And you &apos;ve made it to make the memory self of patient A much better off with it . Because now you have patient A , a better story about your experience , given you . 
What makes a story look like ? 
And that &apos;s true of the stories that memory tells us . And it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent . 
What makes a story look like is upheavals , significant moments and ends . 
End is very , very important . And in this case , the end dominated . 
Now , the living self lives his life continuously . 
It has moments of experience , one after the other . 
And you ask , what happens to these moments ? 
And the answer is really simple . They &apos;re forever lost . 
I mean , most moments of our lives . And I have calculated that . You know , the psychological present is considered to be for about three seconds . What does knowledge mean ? You know , in a life it &apos;s about 600 million of them . In a month , there &apos;s about 600,000 . Most of you leave no trace of that . 
Most of you will be completely ignored by the memory self . 
And yet , somehow you get the impression that you should count . That what &apos;s going on during these moments of experience . Our life is , 
it &apos;s the limited resource that we consume , while we &apos;re on this world , 
and how we use it would be seemingly important , apparently . But that &apos;s not the story that this memory self is telling us for us . 
So we have the memory self . And the living self . And they &apos;re really quite different . 
The biggest difference between them is the way they deal with time 
from the perspective of the living . Even if they &apos;re on vacation and they &apos;re on vacation for the second week as good as the first . Then there &apos;s the two @-@ week vacation twice as good as the one @-@ week holiday . 
That &apos;s how it doesn &apos;t work at all . That &apos;s not how it works for the memory self , 
for the memory self , a two @-@ week holiday is hardly better than a one @-@ week holiday . Because there &apos;s no new memories added . 
You have the story not changed . 
And to do that , time is actually the critical variable , which is a different thing from a living self . Even time has very little influence on this story . 
Now , the remembering self does more than remember and stories make more telling . 
It &apos;s actually the one . The decisions are made . Because if you make a patient who says , &quot; We have two intestinal reflections with two different surgeons , and decides which one to choose , he should . &quot; Then there &apos;s the one who chooses the one who has the memory , which is less bad . And that &apos;s the surgeon who chooses to be selected . 
The living self doesn &apos;t have a voice in that choice . Actually , 
we don &apos;t choose between experiences . We choose between memories of experiences . 
And even if we think about the future , we think about our future , usually not as experiences . 
We think about our future when we foresee memories . 
And basically , they can look at that . You know , as a tyranny of the memory self . And you can imagine the memory self , as one . That , so to speak , the living self is dragging through experiences that the living self doesn &apos;t need . 
I have the impression that if we leave , that &apos;s very common , it &apos;s the case . That means we make vacation , largely in the service of the memory self . 
And that &apos;s a little hard to justify , I think . 
I mean , how much do we feed from our memories ? 
That &apos;s one of the explanations that &apos;s been given for the dominance of the memory self . 
And when I think about that , I think about a vacation that we &apos;re going to spend a few years ago in Antarctica , which is clearly the best vacation we &apos;ve ever had . And I think relatively often about it relative to how often I have to think about other vacations . 
And I probably heard about my memories of these three @-@ week trips . I would say about 25 minutes for about 25 minutes in the last four years . 
Now , if I ever opened the folder with the 600 folders , with the 600 images in it , I would have spent another hour . 
Now , that &apos;s three weeks . And that &apos;s at most . One and a half hours . 
It seems like there &apos;s disagreement there . 
Well , I like a little bit extreme . You know , in it , how little appetite I have for feeding memories ? But even if you have more of it , there &apos;s a real question . Why do we give memories so much weight in the scourge to weight , the weight we give experiences ? 
So I want you to talk about a thought experiment . So 
imagine your next vacation , imagine . You know that at the end of the vacation , all your pictures are destroyed . And you get an amnesty drug like this , so you get nothing to remember . 
Now , would you like to choose the same vacation ? And if you want to choose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two two species of self . And you have to think about how you &apos;re going to decide this conflict . And that &apos;s really not obvious at all . Because if you &apos;re going to be thinking about time , you get an answer . And if you &apos;re thinking about memories , you could have a different answer , you could get a different one . 
Why we &apos;re going to choose the vacations that we choose ? One problem that we face with is a choice between the choices made between the two types of self . 
Well , the two kinds of self throw two terms of happiness into two . 
There are actually two concepts of happiness : The ones that we can apply , one per self . 
They can ask , how happy is that living self ? 
And then they would ask , how happy are the moments in life of the living self ? 
And they &apos;re all happiness . For moments , it &apos;s a fairly complicated process . 
What are the emotions measured ? What are the emotions that can be measured ? 
And by the way , we &apos;re now able to have a pretty good idea . Of the happiness of the living self over time . 
If you look after the happiness of the memory self , it &apos;s a very different thing . 
This is not about how happy . A person lives . 
It &apos;s about how satisfied or happy . The person is when that person is about his or her life . 
Very different . 
Everybody who understands these terms doesn &apos;t differentiate will study the study of happiness . And I &apos;m one of a lot of researchers about well @-@ being , who is studying happiness long gone wrong . And that &apos;s exactly the way that 
the distinction between the happiness of the living self is made . And happiness of the remembering self is in the last few years recognized . And now you &apos;re trying to make the two separate measurements . 
The Gallup Organization has a global survey of the more than one in half a million people asking questions . About that , what they &apos;re talking about about their lives and about their experiences . And there were other efforts in the direction . 
In the last few years , we &apos;ve started to think about the happiness of the two kinds of self . 
And the main lesson we think we have learned , I think , is that they really are different . 
You can know how satisfied someone is with his life . And that &apos;s what she really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happy he lives his life . And vice versa . 
Just to give you an idea of the correlation between them . Correlation is about five percent . 
What that means is that if you want to meet someone and you would meet them , you would tell them , &quot; Oh , his father is a two @-@ meter man . &quot; How much would you know about his height ? 
Well , you would know about his size . But there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty . 
You have so much uncertainty . 
If I tell you that somebody is going to spend his life as eight on a scale of 10 . Do you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self ? 
The correlation is therefore low . 
We know something about what happiness is about happiness self . 
We know that money is very important . Goals are very important . 
We know happiness is essentially content , content is content with people who we like , time to spend , with people who we like . 
There are other pleasures . But that &apos;s dominant . 
If you do happiness , then , for the two kinds of self to maximize . Will you end up with very different things ? 
The conclusion from what I &apos;m here saying is that what I said here is that we really don &apos;t think of happiness as a substitute for well @-@ being . 
It &apos;s a completely different term . 
Now , very briefly . Another reason for that is that we don &apos;t know how to think about happiness is that we don &apos;t think about the same things . If we think about life and think about life , and if we actually live . 
If you think about the simple question of how happy people are in California , then , how happy people are . Will they not be the right answer ? 
If they get that question , think that the people in California are happier than they are . If they say , &quot; We live in Ohio . 
&quot; And what happens is that if they talk about life in Ohio , when they think about life in California , they think about the difference between California and other places . And that difference is , say , climate . 
Well , it turns out climate is not very important for climate , for the living self . And it &apos;s not even very important for the thoughtful self to think about . That decides how happy people are . 
Now , because the thoughtful self is responsible , you can be responsible in the end . Some people might end up in California , 
right ? And it &apos;s kind of interesting to track . What happens to people who go to California , in the hope of being happier ? 
Well , their living self is not going to get happier . 
We know that . 
But one thing is going to happen . They &apos;re going to think they &apos;re happier . Because if you think about that , you &apos;re going to be reminded of how terrible the weather in Ohio was . And you &apos;re going to feel you &apos;re making the right decision . 
It &apos;s very difficult to tell clearly about well @-@ being . And I hope I &apos;ve got you an idea of how horrible the weather in Ohio is . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question for you . 
Thank you . 
Well , when we started thinking a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that it was a pretty interesting result , which came out of this Gallup survey . 
Is that something you told us about ? Because you &apos;re now going to have a few minutes left . 
Daniel Kahneman : Sure . 
I think the most interesting result we have in the Gallup survey is that it &apos;s a number that we absolutely don &apos;t find expected to find . 
We found that in terms of the happiness of the survivor himself . 
If we looked at how feelings with the income vary 
and how it represents , it turns out that under an income of 60 000 dollars , in the year , Americans . And that &apos;s a very big sample of Americans , about 600 000 . But it &apos;s a big representative sample of an income of about 600 000 dollars in the year . 
CA : 60,000 . 
DK : 60 . 
000 . 60 . 000 . Dollar . In the year , people are unhappy . And they &apos;re getting increasingly unhappy . The poorer they get about 
it , we get an absolutely flat line . 
I mean , I rarely have such flat lines seen . 
What happened is , obviously , money doesn &apos;t get you experience happiness . But that lack of money certainly gives you misery . And we can get this misery , very , very clear . 
In the sense of the other , even the remembering self , you get a different story . 
The more money you make , the more satisfied you are . 
That &apos;s not true of emotions . 
CA : But Danny , throughout America &apos;s endeavor , it &apos;s about life , freedom . The aspiration for happiness . 
When people find this finding seriously , I would mean it seems like it all looks upside down . Everything we believe to be , for example , in tax policy . And so on . 
There &apos;s an opportunity that politicians , that the country in general , has a finding like the seriousness . And based on that , politics would do it . 
DK : You know ? I think it &apos;s recognition for being able to play the role of gambling research in politics . 
Recognition is slowly going to be . In the United States , no question . But in the United Kingdom , it &apos;s just happening . And in other countries , it &apos;s happening right now . 
People are in the process of recognizing that they think of happiness . If you think about politics , 
it &apos;s going to take a while . And people are going to discuss whether you &apos;re going to explore experience happiness , or whether you want to explore life assessment . So we need to really soon discuss this discussion , 
how to increase happiness . So , it &apos;s very different . Depending on how you think . And whether you &apos;re thinking about the memory self , or whether you &apos;re thinking about the living self . 
That &apos;s what politics is going to be . It &apos;s what I think . In the years to come , 
in the United States , you &apos;re going to be tightening on the happiness of the people . 
That &apos;s what I think will happen in the next decade or two , part of the national statistics . 
CA : Well , it seems to me that this topic is going to , or should , at least be the most interesting political debate to follow . About the next few years . 
Thank you very much . For inventing the behavioral economy . 
Thank you . Danny Kahneman : Today 
I &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate . 
And that might surprise you a little bit , because my full @-@ time work at the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds , about the things we invent and deliver , about the poorest two billion , about a better life for the poorest . 
But energy and climate are extremely important for these people . In fact , more important than any other person on the planet . 
Climate degradation means that their seeds are growing for many years to come , and we &apos;re going to grow too much or too little rain . Things are going to change as things change as they create their fragile environment can &apos;t sustain . 
That leads to starvation . It leads to insecurity . It leads to unrest . 
So , climate change is going to be terrible for you . And 
also , the energy price for you is very important . 
The fact is , if you &apos;re just talking about one thing , you could reduce the price . To reduce poverty , energy would be by far the most effective . 
Well , the energy price is over time . 
In fact , the progress society is based on energy progress . 
Coal evolution drove industrial revolution . And even in the 20th century , there was a rapid fall in electricity price . And so we have refrigerators , air conditioning . We can use modern materials to make as many things as 
we can . We &apos;re so in a wonderful place to be in with electricity , in the rich world . 
But if we pay down the price , we let the price halve . Let &apos;s meet a new barrier . And this barrier is related to CO2 . 
CO2 warms the planet and the equation for CO2 is actually actually pretty clear . 
They sum up the CO2 emitted , which leads to temperature increase . And this temperature increase has some very negative effects , effects on the weather . And maybe worse , the indirect consequence is that natural ecosystems are so rapidly changing that they &apos;re unable to adapt . And so whole systems collapse . 
Now , the exact connection between a CO2 increase and the resulting temperature change , and where they continue to follow . There &apos;s some ambiguity . But not very many . 
And there are certainly ambiguities about how bad this impact will be . But they &apos;re getting extremely bad . 
I have the top scientists several times asked , &quot; Do we really have to get down to near zero ? 
&quot; &quot; Is that enough ? &quot; Not half . Or a quarter . 
The answer is , until we get close to zero . Will the temperature rise ? 
So it &apos;s a big challenge . 
It &apos;s very different from saying , &quot; We have a three and a half @-@ foot truck that &apos;s under a three @-@ meter bridge to come . &quot; That &apos;s what you can sort of squeeze under . This 
one has to be downward @-@ down to zero . 
Well , we run into a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons . 
Every American , about 20 tons of people from poor countries , less than one on average , 
it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet . 
And somehow we need to create changes that can bring that down to zero . 
It &apos;s been constantly increasing . 
Only different economic ones . Changes have it affected at all . And we need to be moved from rapid growth to reduction and to a reduction , except zero . 
This equation has four factors . A little multiplication . You &apos;ve got this thing on the left , CO2 , that you want to get to zero . And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen to the number of people , to the services that every human being uses on average , the average energy for every service , and the CO2 emitted per unit of energy . 
Let &apos;s therefore let &apos;s take every factor individually . And let &apos;s think about how we can get that to zero . 
Probably , one of these numbers has to be very close to zero . 
Now , that &apos;s basic algebra . But let &apos;s go through it . 
First of all , we have the population 
today . 6.8 billion people and 
it &apos;s screaming up to 9 billion , 
the population is going to 9 billion , the population is going to move . If we succeed very successfully with new vaccines , healthcare and reproductive medicine . Could we possibly do that by 10 to 15 percent ? But at the moment , we &apos;re seeing a 1.3 percent rise . 
The second factor is services , the services we use . 
This includes everything : Food that we eat , clothing , television , heating . 
These are very good things . And poverty reduction means these services almost to everyone on the planet accessible to them . 
It &apos;s great that this number is rising 
in the rich world , in the top billion , we might be able to make cuts and use less . But on average , this number is going to rise every year , and so overall , it &apos;s more than doubling . The number of services per person per person is going to increase . 
Here we see a very basic service . Are there at home lights to make sure you read the homework ? 
And these students have not . So they go out and read their homework under the street light . 
Now , effectiveness , the E , the energy per service , finally there &apos;s good news . 
We have something that doesn &apos;t go up . 
Because of different successes in the lighting sector , because of other types of cars , because of new methods in building houses . There are many services that you spend drastically on reducing energy . Drastically reducing energy can be 103.00 @ 05.50 , 000 GT , 00.05 @ 53 , 000 . 
Some services can be reduced by 90 % . Some individual services can be reduced by 90 % . 
Others can be reduced by 90 % by services such as fertilisers ( 105.00 - 05.56 , 000 GT , 00.05 , 58.000 ) or air transport or air transport , and the room for improvement is much smaller overall . 
If we are optimistic , we may get a reduction of a factor 3 or perhaps a factor 3 or perhaps even a factor 6 . 
But in the first three factors , we are now 26 out of 26 billion . Maybe the very best 13 billion tons have gone . And that &apos;s just not enough . 
Let &apos;s look at the fourth factor . And this one is going to be a key factor . That &apos;s the amount of CO2 that &apos;s per unit of energy . 
It &apos;s emitted . It turns out the question is , is that you get that to zero ? 
If you burn coal , no , 
if you burn natural gas , no , 
almost every method of producing electricity emits . Today , CO2 , except renewable energy and nuclear energy . 
So what we do on a global level must be a global level , a new system . 
We need energy under . 
If I &apos;m going to use the term &quot; miracle , &quot; I don &apos;t mean the impossible . 
The microprocessor is a miracle . The PC is a miracle , 
the Internet and its services are a miracle . 
People here have a miracle to develop many of these miracles . 
Normally , there &apos;s no deadline for you to do a miracle up to a certain date . 
Normally , you &apos;re just standing beside it . And some come not . In 
this case , we have to give full gas . And a miracle in very short time is getting . 
Well , I wondered , how can I really get this over ? 
Are there natural illustration ? A demonstration that shows the idea of the people here . 
I remembered the idea . Last year , when I brought mosquitos and kind of liked people , that &apos;s 
what I wanted . The idea became for them really tangible . You know , it &apos;s people who have mosquitos living 
with mosquitos for energy . I got this one . 
I decided that releasing mosquitoes of fireflies , my contribution this year to the environment , would be here . 
Here are a couple of natural fireflies . 
You &apos;ve assured me that they &apos;re not biting . In fact , they &apos;re not even going to leave the glass . 
Well , there &apos;s all kinds of game solutions like this . But they bring none of them much . 
We need solutions . Either one or more of them , which are an unimaginable scale and unimaginable reliability . And although there are many directions in which people are looking for it , I really only see five of them looking for these big challenges . 
I &apos;ve got tides , geothermal fusion and biofuels out there . 
They may be doing a moderate contribution . And if they do better than I expect , that would be great . But my key message here is that we &apos;re working on all those five . And we can &apos;t do any of them because they intimidate us . Because everybody has significant problems . 
Let &apos;s first look at them . Burning fossil fuels is burning . Burning either coal or natural gas . 
What you do there seems to be easy . But that &apos;s not it . You &apos;d have to take all the CO2 that comes out of the chimney after you burn it , under pressure , liquefied . And then somewhere , and hope that it &apos;s there . 
There are some pilot projects that are going to do this at a 60 @-@ 80 level , but get it to 100 . Very difficult , and it &apos;s going to be an agreement on the storage of CO2 , is a big challenge . But the biggest problem here is the storage time question . 
Who &apos;s going to make sure ? 
Who can guarantee something ? What literally many billions of times larger than any kind of waste , you can get away from nuclear and other things , 
you can imagine . This is a lot of volume . 
This is a hard nut . 
Next , nuclear energy 
, which also has three major problems . The cost , especially in highly regulated countries , is high . The question of security , that you really feel that nothing goes wrong , can &apos;t go wrong . Despite human cooperation , that the fuel is not for weapons , that fuel is not used . 
And what do you do with the waste ? 
Because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concern . People have to worry about it well . 
184.00 , 10.20 , 000 GT , 00.10 , 25.000 . So three very difficult problems . They might be solvable , 
so three very difficult problems . They might be solvable and they might be solvable , and so you should work on them . 
The last three of the five I &apos;ve summarized . 
They &apos;re renewables . They &apos;re the kind of renewable energy that they &apos;re often called . 
And they also have renewables , although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel . They have some disadvantages . 
One is that energy density is the energy density that these technologies generate dramatically lower than that of power plants . 
These are low @-@ energy . You talk about many square kilometers , thousands of times more space than a normal power plant . And 
also , these sources are subject to interruptions . 
The sun doesn &apos;t shine all day long . It also doesn &apos;t shine every day . And the same way , the wind blows . Not constantly . So you 
have to , if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , have a way to have the energy even in times . If you don &apos;t have it available to get it . 
There &apos;s so big price challenges here . There are challenges in transmission . If , for example , we say that the energy source is outside the country , you don &apos;t just need the technology . You also need to be able to deal with the risk that the energy comes from where it comes from . 
And there &apos;s the storage problem . 
And to scale this up , I have been all sorts of different batteries . They &apos;re made , looking at those for cars , computers , mobile phones , flashlights for everything . And that &apos;s what I &apos;ve got with the amount of electronic energy that the world uses . I found out that all batteries that we now produce . Less than 10 minutes of total energy could 
be stored . We need to have a big breakthrough here , something that , by a factor of 100 , will be better than the approaches at the moment . 
That &apos;s not impossible . But it &apos;s not that easy . 
That happens when you try to try and spread these interrupted sources . We say 20 @-@ 30 percent of consumption . 
If you &apos;re 100 percent reliant on that , you need a tremendous wonder battery . 
Now , where are we going to go ? What is the right approach ? 
A Manhattan project . How do we get to the finish line ? 
What we need is a lot of companies . They &apos;re working on it . Hundreds 
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people . 
For many , you &apos;ll say , &quot; They &apos;re crazy . &quot; That &apos;s good . 
I think here in TED . Group : There are many who are already engaged there . 
Bill Gross has several companies , including one called Esolar . The great solar thermal technologies have invested 
Vinod Khosla in dozens of companies . The great things are doing and interesting opportunities . And I &apos;m trying to support that . 
Nathan Myhrvold and I are funding a company that , surprisingly , might be pursuing the nuclear approach . 
There are some innovations in the nuclear field : Modular , liquid . 
The development has been very important in this industry some time ago . So it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are lying around . 
The Terrapower concept means that instead of a part of the uranium that you are one percent . The U235 : We decided to take the 99 percent to burn . The 
U238 . That &apos;s a pretty crazy idea . 
But actually , you had been talking about it for a long time . But you could never simulate reasonably whether it worked , if it was . But since it became modern supercomputers , you can simulate it and see that yes , with the right approach to materials , it looks like it looks like it works . 
And because you can burn these 99 , the cost profile is much better . In fact , 
you burn the garbage , and you can even burn the garbage from today &apos;s reactors . 
As a drive , instead of using your head to break down , you just burn it . A great thing . 
The uranium is being used gradually . A little bit like a candle . 
You can see that it &apos;s a kind of column . It &apos;s often called a wandering wave , reactor . 
That really solves . The fuel problem . 
Here &apos;s a picture of a place in Kentucky . 
This is the waste that &apos;s 99 % . You have the part of the burned today . It &apos;s taken out . So it &apos;s called &quot; depleted uranium . 
&quot; That shoots the U.S. for hundreds of hundreds of years . 
And if you buy ocean water cheap and simply filtered , you get enough fuel for the rest . Life of the planet . 
You know , there &apos;s still a lot of challenges . But it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that are being developed that we need to move forward . 
Let &apos;s think about how we can measure our success 
. How should our testimony look ? 
Well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to achieve . And then we talk about the intermediate step . 
Many talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 . 
It &apos;s really , really important that we get there , 
the remaining 20 percent . In poor countries , we &apos;re going to be producing and still farming . Hopefully , forest threats and cement will be clean by then . 
So , around this 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like China , needs to completely transform their generation of electricity . 
The other note says , is we going to use zero emissions technology , is it going to be used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to getting them to the rest ? 
That &apos;s super important . 
That &apos;s going to be a key element . This certificate , if we 
go back from there . How should that be 2020 testimony ? 
It should be back to the two elements . 
We should be using the effectiveness measures to reduce the amount of money that we &apos;re doing . The less we &apos;re emitting , the less CO2 we &apos;re going to get . And so will the temperature . 
But actually , this note is for things that we &apos;re doing , things that are not completely too much of a reduction , just the same or even a little less important than the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs . 
These breakthroughs we need to track with full @-@ gas . And that &apos;s what we can measure . In company numbers , in pilot projects and regulatory changes . 
There are many great books on this subject . 
The Al Gore Book . We have a choice , and David McKay &apos;s Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air . They 
go it through and they actually create a framework in which this is widely discussed . Because we need support from all of the sides to do that . 
There are a lot . There &apos;s a need for this coming together . 
That &apos;s a wish . 
It &apos;s a very concrete wish that we invent this technology . 
If you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , let me . I could give the president a choice : A vaccine , and that &apos;s what I love . I or I could choose that wish . That &apos;s half the energy price . Without CO2 , it &apos;s invented . That desire I would take . 
This one has the greatest impact . 
If we take that wish , it &apos;s not the gap between the long @-@ term and the short @-@ term that will be thinking . People get horrible between the United States and China , between the poor and rich countries . And almost all live on these two billion , they get much worse . 
What do we have to do ? 
What measures do I appeal for ? 
We have to work for more research funding . 
If countries are in places like Koppenhagen , countries should not meet just through CO2 , 
they should talk about it . They should discuss this innovation strategy . And they would be shocked by the ridiculously low money that is being spent on these innovative approaches . 
We need market incentives , carbon taxes . Cap &amp; amp ; Trade , something that sends a price signal . 
We need to spread the news . 
We need dialogue , more rational and more complete . And so do the things that are being done by the government . 
It &apos;s an important wish . But I think we can fulfill it . 
Thank you very much . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . Thank you . 
Thank you very much . Just to get Terrapower a little better . First of all , you can give us an idea . The scale of this investment is Bill 
Gates to simulate the simulation on a supercomputer . All the big scientists get what we did . Do we just need a few 10 million ? And even if we use our materials in a Russian reactor to test our materials to make sure it works reasonably , you &apos;re only in the 100s , million . 
The difficult step is building the building of the first reactor , another billion . The regulations and the place where they actually are the first to build . 
Once the first one is finished , when it &apos;s going as promised , then everything is very clear . Because the economic viability , the energy density , is so different from nuclear energy as we are . 
You know about this right , about to understand . That means deep into the ground . Almost like a vertical pillar of nuclear fuel , this consumed uranium . And then the process begins . Up there , and continues to work down . 
BG : Exactly today , you have to reconnect the reactor . So there are many people and many controls that go wrong . This thing , where you open it and things in or out . This is not good . 
If you do , however , have very cheap fuel , you can refill it for 60 years . Think about a column that you can bury without the whole thing complexity . 
And it sits there and it burns for 60 years . And then it &apos;s done . 
CA : A nuclear reactor that itself is a solution to the garbage . 
BG : Yeah . Well , what about the garbage ? You can sit it . There &apos;s much less garbage . With this method , then take it and grab it . In the next reactor , burn it further . 
And we start by putting the garbage away from the existing garbage , which already exists in these refrigerators or dry containers at the reactors . That &apos;s our starting fuel . So that &apos;s 
what kind of reactors are facing . What was a problem is what we &apos;re filling in . And that &apos;s going to dramatically reduce the volume of waste . During this process , 
about , but as you &apos;re working with different people in the world on these possibilities . 
Where is that ? The biggest interest . So what really is going to happen ? 
BG : Well , we haven &apos;t got to go to one place yet . And there &apos;s a lot of interesting disclosure rules for everything that nuclear is wearing in the name . There &apos;s a lot of interest . And people in the company were in Russia , India , China . I was here and I have the Energy Minister and I &apos;ve been talking about how this fits into the energy agenda . 
I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the French and Japanese have something in the direction of 
this . This is a variant of one thing . It was done . 
This is an important step forward . But it &apos;s like a fast reactor . And some countries have built this . So everybody who &apos;s building a fast reactor is a candidate for a candidate for our first one . 
CA : In your imagination , timeframe and probability , this really is what you want to create . 
BG : Well , we need one of these scalable , power generating things that is very cheap . We have 20 years to invent . And then 20 years to deploy . 
This is kind of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us , which we have to comply with . 
And you know , Terrapower ? If everything goes well and that &apos;s a big wish . Could that keep 
it easy ? And fortunately , today , there are dozens of companies . And we need hundreds that do the same . If their approaches work , the promotion for their . Pilots work , can offer them . 
And it would be best if it could do several . Because then you could create a mix . Anyway , you 
need a solution . 
CA : Concerning the big possible breakthroughs , this is the biggest thing you know . 
BG : An energy break is the most important thing . 
That would be without the environmental challenge . But the power is still doing so much more important 
in the nuclear sector . Are there other innovative companies 
? You know , we know about their work not as well as these . But there are the modular methods . That &apos;s another approach . 
There &apos;s a liquid reactor type that &apos;s kind of difficult . But maybe the ones who say that about us . 
And so there are different ones . But the beauty of that is that a uranium molecule is a million times as much energy . It &apos;s like saying a carbon molecule . And so if you &apos;re dealing with the problems , can you ? And they &apos;re mainly radiation from the footprint . And the cost is the potential . So the impact on the land and other things , almost in one &apos;s own league . 
CA : If that doesn &apos;t work , what 
do we have to do is take emergency measures to try and keep the Earth temperature stable ? 
BG : If you &apos;re in this situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;re eating too much . And just before a heart attack , you &apos;re about to get there . What do you do ? You might need a heart surgery or something like that . 
There &apos;s a research that &apos;s going on called geoengineering , which is going to look at different techniques to delay warming , so we can 20 or 30 years longer to get us together . 
This is just an insurance method . 
You hope we can &apos;t need that . 
Some people say you should not even get to the insurance first to work because you can maybe be lazy , so you can eat , because you know you &apos;re eating , because you &apos;re going to save you from heart surgery . 
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart . If you look at the importance of this problem , you know . But there are now discourses in the geoengineering world about whether to do that at your disposal . If things get faster or if they get this innovation longer than we expect . 
CA : Climate skeptics , do you have one or two sentences for those to convince you ? 
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps . 
Those who have scientific arguments are very little . 
Tell them it &apos;s negative effects . There are negative effects with the clouds . Things shift . 
There are very , very few things that they say at all , of which there is a chance in a million , in a million . 
The main problem here is very much like AIDS . 
You make the mistake . Now , and you pay a lot later on . 
And so that &apos;s why the idea is , now , if you have all sorts of urgent problems , to invest in something that you &apos;re only going to have later , and then the investment doesn &apos;t get so clear . In fact , the IPCC Report is not necessarily the worst scenario . And there are people in the rich world who are getting IPCC @-@ looking and saying , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s not a big drama . The 
fact is that this uncertainty gives us cause for concern . 
But my dream here is that if you want to make it economically and simultaneously make it CO2 clear , then you &apos;ll also be the skeptics . &quot; Okay . It interests me not that it &apos;s not emitting CO2 . I wish almost that it did that . But I &apos;m probably going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . CA 
: And that would be your answer to that . Björn Lomborg &apos;s argument that if you were to spend all of this time and energy to use the CO2 problem to solve it , All the other goals suffer from it . Poverty reduction , the fight against malaria and so on , so that it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources , money to invest in it , while it &apos;s better things that we can do . 
BG : Well , the actual spending on research , let &apos;s say the U.S. should . 10 billion a year . More than you spend today . That &apos;s not so dramatic . Underneath 
it should not suffer other things . 
You come to big amounts of money . And here , sensible people can contradict . If you have something that &apos;s not economically sound and try to do that . For me , this is where most waste happens . It &apos;s 
unless you &apos;re very short on the eve of a cost breakthrough and you &apos;re financing it . Only the learning curve . I think we should do more things that try to have the potential , much cheaper to be . 
If the swab you get is a very high energy price , then you can only get the rich to keep up . 
I mean , each of us here could do five times as much for our energy , without spending our lifestyle on changing . For 
the lower two billion , but is it a disaster ? And 
even Lomborg . Think about 
his new mesh now is why is it that research isn &apos;t being discussed anymore ? He 
&apos;s still being discussed because of his earlier stories with the skeptic camp . But he understood that this is one very lonely group . And so he &apos;s now bringing the research argument . 
And that &apos;s a thought that I &apos;m thinking is appropriate . 
Research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little support is given to it . 
CA : Bill . I think I &apos;m speaking for almost . All the people here . If I say , &quot; I really hope that your desire will come true . &quot; Thank you very much . 
BG : Thank you . 
I would like to tell you something that I thought I &apos;d like to do a few months ago when I wrote an article for Italian . Wired noticed , &quot; 
I wrote a letter . Always my synonymous dictionary is ready for use . But I was with editing the dictionary . And I noticed that I was still never in my life , looking at it . What the word hinders really means , &quot; I 
read you the entry , disabled . 
&quot; Adjective : Curved . Helpless , useless . Destruined . Deceased , mutilated . Wounded , prepared , paralyzed , separated . &quot; Deposited , worn out , weakened , impotent , castrated , paralyzed &quot; &quot; Geandicapt senil &quot; : Age @-@ weak , withdrawn , repaired , done , broken . &quot; Geborsten &quot; counted ( see also injured , useless and weak ) 
&quot; Anonyme &quot; : Healthy , strong , powerful . 
I have this list with a friend read out loud and I had to laugh first . It worked so ridiculous . But I just came up prepared and could not be able to speak any more and had to stop reading and me . First of all , collect after this invincible flood of words and the 
emotional shock that it causes . Of course , this was a fractured old synonym dictionary . I got just thinking that the word issue was pretty old , it had 
to be . But actually , it was an issue . It was in the early &apos; 80s , when I was just beginning primary school . And that started my self @-@ image outside of my family environment , and started to form it . It was also related to other children and the rest of the world around me . 
And God thank you . Have I no synonymous dictionary at that time ? Would 
I use this entry seriously ? Would I be in a world born of someone like me as a person who would perceive me as a person whose life in no way can be positive ? But today I &apos;m going to vote for opportunities and adventures that I &apos;ve experienced . 
So I &apos;ve immediately been celebrating the online edition of 2009 , and I expected that I would be making a more appealing contribution here . 
Here &apos;s the updated version . This entry , 
unfortunately , is not much better . 
In particular , the last two words shake me under Near Anonyms completely and healthy . But 
it &apos;s not just about the words . 
It &apos;s about what we &apos;re talking about people who we think about with these words , and they &apos;re not about what we &apos;re talking about . 
It &apos;s about values , the values that are in those words , and how we &apos;re constructing those values , how 
our language affects us . Our thinking and how we &apos;re shaping the world and people around us , how we &apos;re seeing the world 
and how we &apos;re seeing it . Many ancient societies , including Greeks , and Greeks and Romans , really believed that the Greeks and Romans &apos; debate of a curse has a great force , because what you say loud is manifesting itself , too . 
So what do we actually want to manifest ? A disabled person or a powerful person alone , already a 
human being mindlessly as a child , could be enough to limit them and give them ideas . To impose it would 
not be more beautiful to open doors to them . A 
human being who for me opens doors was my pediatrician , and I was a child doctor . AM : A.I. DuPont Institute in Wilmington , Delaware . 
His name is Dr. Pizzutillo , an Italo @-@ American whose name , you can imagine . Most Americans , not correctly speaking , could not speak . So he was always Dr. P. 
called Dr. P. And Dr. P. always wore very colorful flies and was for the kids to work with , just 
like it was created . I found the time I spent working with this hospital , the hospital . It was just great . Except for my physiotherapy . 
I had to do individual exercises , seemingly infinitely often . With these thick elastic bands in different colors , you know , around my leg muscles , you know . And I have these bands hated more than anything else . I have hated them . I have cursed them . I have hated them . 
And imagine if you can imagine I even have been five years old . I have negotiated with Dr. P. And so this is how to stop these exercises . Natural , without success . 
And one day he has cursed me at one of my exercises . These exercises were just tiring and merciless . And he said to me , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you &apos;re such a strong guy . Strong and young girl . You &apos;re going to be one of those tapes one day . 
And if you can do it , I &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot; 
That was , of course , just a simple trick by Dr. P. to do the exercises that I don &apos;t do , with the prospect of the richest five @-@ year @-@ old girl in the hospital on the second floor . But he got me actually to do my daily exercise horror with new eyes , to see . So it turned into a new and promising experience . 
And I wonder today how much I &apos;m feeling about his vision of me as a strong and powerful one . Young girl , my self @-@ image , shaped me , and I could imagine myself as one of nature &apos;s strong , powerful and atlethic people , seeing myself as one of the most atlethic . 
This is just one example . Of many , like adults in power positions , the imagination of a child can inspire . 
But how do the examples from the examples already cited from the synonymous dictionaries prove that our language doesn &apos;t allow us any room to imagine something ? What we all want would be it for each and every one of us to allow ourselves to be seen as powerful people . 
Our language lags behind social change . The changes that we often see through a technological change are often triggered by a technological 
change . From a medical point of view , of course , one can say that my legs , laser surgery for visually impaired visually impaired , knee joints made of titanium and artificial hip joints for aging bodies , which allow people to really use all their possibilities and to transcend the limits that their natural destiny has set them , even to develop , not to speak of social networking platforms . People are able to create their own identity , give themselves in their own way , define themselves , 
thereby participating in the global group of groups that they themselves choose , and 
so on . Perhaps , then , this technological change is clearer than ever , that it has always been a different truth , namely that every person in society has something very special and very powerful giving , and that every person in human capacity can adapt . Our greatest plus is 
human ability to adapt to each other . That &apos;s an interesting story because people have always told me about it , asking me to tell me how to deal with adversity . And I &apos;m going to confess something to you : This sentence never fit for me . And I &apos;ve always been very uncomfortable . I &apos;ve felt the questions of people about answering them . And I think gradually , I understand why this 
sentence about how to deal with adversity lives . From the idea that success or happiness is dependent on it , a challenge to master without being challenged by the experience that it entails . As if my life is so successful , because I &apos;ve been able to traps in a life with a prosthetic , avoiding the possible traps of a life , or whatever , people perceive me with my disability . 
But the truth is that we are changing . Of course , we are shaped by the challenge . Whether you &apos;re physically , emotionally or even both . 
And I &apos;m saying that &apos;s good . 
Adversity is not an obstacle that we need to curve to work with our lives better , to make 
it clear . Adversity is just part of our lives . 
And I tend to treat adversity as my shadow . 
Sometimes I realize that it &apos;s very present . Sometimes it &apos;s hardly visible . But it &apos;s constantly with me . 
And I want to do that by no means . The impact , or the severity of the fight , of a human being . 
There are in life adversity and challenges . And they &apos;re all too real . And every person goes differently with it . But the question is not whether we can deal with adversity clearly or not , but how we deal with it clearly . 
We &apos;re not just for that , therefore . People who we love before blows of fate save us from blows of fate , but also prepare them for it . All right . So , to get it right . 
And we do our kids no favours . If we give them the feeling that they feel they don &apos;t adapt . 
You have to get two things to separate clearly . One is medical fact amputees . And the other is medical fact amputee , social opinion about it . Whether I &apos;m disabled or not . 
And to be honest , the only real and lasting disability is with the one I have to deal with , and to be honest , the only real disability I have had to deal with is that the world is constantly saying . It can connect me with these definitions . 
In our desire to make people protected , the people that care about us and to give them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis , or even a prognosis about quality of life that they are expecting , we need to do . We need to be careful not to lay the foundation for someone actually being disabled . 
Maybe that &apos;s the current concept that &apos;s just looking at what &apos;s broken in a broken . And how we fix that for everybody , a bigger disability for everyone than pathology in the way that we fix it . 
If we want to avoid treating a human being holistically and not treat all of his forces and possibilities . And recognize , we create , in addition to the natural struggle that you may need to fight . 
Another disease . We degrade a human being who is responsible for our society , and we do 
so . So we have to talk beyond patology . We have to look at all areas of human potential , 
and we have to focus on all areas of human potential . Most importantly , however , it &apos;s that there &apos;s a gap between perception of our inadequacies and our great inventive spirit . 
A connection we should have : We should not devalue these challenging times or deny them . We should not try to avoid them . We should not try to avoid them , nor should we sweep them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about recognizing opportunities in adversity . 
It &apos;s perhaps more about making it clear to me that we are not necessarily overcoming adversity , but that we need to be open to it , embrace it , embrace it , grab it in the head , and also , for once , use a fight expression and maybe even dance with it . 
And maybe we can create adversity as something natural , coherent and useful to see and see and feel like this through their presence , no longer so burdened . In 
this year , we celebrate the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin . And when he was 150 years ago about evolution , he wrote about evolution , in my eyes , Darwin has something very true in human character . 
I would say it that way , not the strongest of its kind survives , nor does it survive the smartest of its kind , but of the one that can best adapt to change . 
Conflicts are creating creativity , not just 
from Darwin &apos;s work . We know that the ability of man to survive and flourish is dependent on the struggle of the human mind . It &apos;s determined by conflict to change . 
So again , change and adaptation are the greatest abilities of man . 
And maybe we know only from which wood . We &apos;re carved when we &apos;re really tested . 
Maybe that &apos;s exactly the meaning of adversity . A perception of the ego , a sense of our own power . 
We can feel ourselves something like this . 
We can give adversity a new meaning that is about difficult times beyond difficult times . 
Maybe we can treat adversity as change . 
Adversity stands for change in the way we feel like we don &apos;t yet adapted . 
I think the greatest damage we do to ourselves is the greatest damage we believe we have done to ourselves to be normal . 
Let &apos;s face it . Who &apos;s normal ? 
There &apos;s no normal . 
There &apos;s the usual one . The typical one , but not the normal one , and would you like this poor , gray person ? Really get to know this ? If it really existed ? 
I think it &apos;s not . 
It would be great . If we could have this pattern of normality versus another of the possibilities or the strength . To even do it a little more dangerous , exchange it , exchange it . So we can exchange the forces of very , very many children and get them to release their very special and valuable abilities in the society , to invite them to join . 
Anthropolgen has found out that we humans are being led by the members of our society to one thing : To be useful and to contribute to making a contribution . 
There are indications that there are already Neanderthals who , 60,000 years ago , older people and people with severe physical problems , with worn injuries , who were born . And that might have happened because life experience in the struggle for survival of these people is valuable to society . 
They have these people not broken as broken . And they have been useless . They have been seen as something special and valuable . 
A few years ago , I went to the city , the city where I grew up , to a food market . In that Red Zone , in the northeast of Pennsylvania . And I stood there in front of a cup of tomatoes . 
It was summer . And I had shorts on and 
I hear how a guy like a guy behind me says . Well , if that &apos;s not Aimee Mullins 
and I turn myself around and I see this older man . I didn &apos;t know who he is . 
And I said , &quot; Excuse me . Sir , do we know ? &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t get to remember you . &quot; And 
he said , &quot; Well , you &apos;re unlikely to be reminded of me . &quot; When 
I turned them to see them for the first time , I got them out of their mother &apos;s belly . &quot; 
Oh . So , the ? &quot; 
&quot; And of course , it &apos;s done it , but click . 
&quot; This was Dr. Kean . A man I just made of narratives of my mother about this day , because I knew about this day , of course , because I was typical of my birthday , two weeks late . 
The doctor of prenatal diagnostics of my mother was on vacation . And so my parents knew the man , the man who gave me birth , not at all . 
And because I was born without a calf &apos;s legs . And my feet , after them , had directed themselves , and I just had a few toes on this one and a few toes . On the other foot , it was the carrier . This stranger had to get the bad news . 
He said to me , &quot; I had to tell your parents that you would never walk and never walk like that . You would be like other kids , or you would never be an independent life . And since then , they &apos;ve just lied to me . Really punished . Exceptional 
, I found that he &apos;s been doing newspaper clips of my entire childhood . Whether I was in a letter contest in the second grade , whether I was winning with the scout scouts at the parade , Halloween , traveling with the scouts . Whether I was a scholarship or a scholarship or one of my sporting victories . And he used these clips to make his students teach . Medical students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School . 
And he called this part of his course the X factor , the potential of human will . 
You can &apos;t do enough to emphasize how crucial this factor is to quality of life for a human being . 
And Dr. Kean continued . He said , &quot; I learned that when you don &apos;t keep on telling something else , children get to say something else . And even if they &apos;re just a little bit supported , if you kids themselves are left behind . &quot; Then children can have a lot to do . Look 
, Dr. Kean has his thinking changed . 
He had understood that the medical diagnosis and how someone could do with it was 
two different things . And I too have my thinking . Over the course of time , I have changed . If you can tell me at the age of 15 , if I had my prostheses against legs from meat and meat and bone , would I have changed ? Then I wouldn &apos;t have hesitated for a second . 
I wanted to be normal at that time . 
If you would have asked me that today , I &apos;m not so sure . 
And that &apos;s what happened because I have something to do with my legs . And not despite these experiences . 
And maybe this change could happen as well , because I &apos;ve had so many people meet me with doors that opened my doors instead of meeting people who restrict me or restrict me or overtake an idea . 
Look at that . It really only takes one person to tell you how to demonstrate their forces , how to manifest them . And they &apos;re through . 
If you want to allow someone to have their own inner forces activated . The human mind is so receptive . If you can do that and for someone in a crucial moment , a door opens to you . Then you &apos;re for these people a door . 
Very good teachers . You bring them with you doors to themselves to 
open the doors , the real meaning of the word . Educate is rooted in the word educe . It 
means producing something that in a person is the potential to tickle out , 
again , what potential do we want to retrieve now ? 
In the &apos; 60s , Britain was a case study . Back then , high schools were transformed into schools . 
They call that streaming trials . In the United States , we call that tracking . 
Students are being trained to grade . 
And the A students are getting heavier orally than they are , better teachers , etc . 
, and they have a three @-@ month period of time , students with a grade that is sufficiently good . It &apos;s been told them . They &apos;re aces that they &apos;re very smart . And after these three months , they really have written one . 
And of course , it breaks your heart to hear that the other way around , the one @-@ serer students were told . They &apos;re just enough . And 
the same was the case . After the three months , but only 
those who always have to go to school , the other one . Apart from the students who have to miss the 
school , it was very important . And this study found that teachers were not inaugurated . 
Teachers knew not that something changed . They just 
were told that they were the Einser students , and that they were the students with the grade enough . And the same way , they taught them something . 
And she treats the only real disability is that a broken mind . A spirit that was broken has no hope anymore . It doesn &apos;t find anything anymore . Beautiful . He lacks . Our natural childish curiosity . And our innate ability to imagination , 
if we do , but we can create the human mind to help keep on hoping , to hope , to hope for themselves and other people around him , to find beautiful . Curious and imaginative to be , then we put our forces really positively into action . 
If a mind is talking about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new forms of existence . 
I want to start with a poem that &apos;s written by a Persian poet named Hafiz in the 14th century . And from which my friend Jacques , Dembois , told me , and the poem is called &quot; The God Who Only Words Four Words . &quot; Every child knows God , not the God of the Name , not the God of Forbitions , but the God Who only knows four words . And these are repeated all the time . He always says , 
&quot; Come dance with me . &quot; &quot; Come dance with me . Thank you very much . &quot;
