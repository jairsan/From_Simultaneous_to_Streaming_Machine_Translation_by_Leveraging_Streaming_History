A couple of years ago Here at TED , Peter Skillman presented a design competition called &quot; The Marshmallow Challenge . 
&quot; The idea is . It &apos;s pretty simple . Four teams have to have the widest possible freestanding structure with 20 spaghetti . CA : 1m tape . CA : 1m thread . And build a marshmallow , 
the marshmallow has to be up on top . 
And though it really seems simple , it &apos;s really really hard , because it &apos;s pushing people to work together very quickly . 
And so I thought this is an interesting idea . And I turned it into a design workshop . 
It was a huge success . 
Since then , I &apos;ve been doing about 70 workshops around the world . With students , developers and architects , even CTOs , the Fortune 50 companies , and there &apos;s something about this task . What deep impressions into nature . It allows cooperation , and I want to share some of them with you . 
Normally , most people start orienting themselves on the task . 
They talk about it . They think about what it will look like . They &apos;re rangling for power . 
Then they &apos;re spending a little time planning . And organization . They &apos;re sketching . And they &apos;re putting spaghetti out . 
They &apos;re investing a lot of their time in assembly . And structures are constantly growing . 
And finally , just before they don &apos;t have time anymore , someone takes the Marshmallow . And they &apos;re gently putting him on the top . Step back and admire TA @-@ da . You admire your work . 
But what then ? Almost . It &apos;s always that TA @-@ da becomes an UH @-@ Oh , because the weight of the marshmallow causes the whole thing to bend and collapse , 
and there are a number of people who have much more UH @-@ Oh moments than others . And among the worst are freshest BWL graduates . 
They lie , they cheat . They &apos;re confused . And they produce really poor entities . 
And of course , there are teams that have much more TA @-@ DA formations . And among the best are freshness graduates of the kindergarten , 
and that &apos;s quite amazing . 
As Peter told us , they not only produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all . 
What you might ask is , how does this come about ? Why ? What about those ? 
And Peter doesn &apos;t tell one . The kids spend time being the head of Spaghetti GmbH . They 
don &apos;t spend time in power struggles . 
But there &apos;s another reason , 
and that is that BWL students were trained to find a real plan . OK . 
And then to realize 
what happens . If you put the marshmallow on top , you don &apos;t have time anymore . And what happens ? 
It &apos;s a crisis . 
Sounds familiar . What do 
kindergarten kids do differently ? Is that they start with the marshmallow ? And prototypes build successful prototypes . Always with the marshmallow at the top . So they have multiple opportunities to repair dilapidated prototypes . 
Constructors recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of an iterative process . 
And with every attempt , the kids get immediate feedback . What works and what doesn &apos;t work . 
So the performance is to work with prototypes . So , a lot . But let &apos;s see how different teams operate . 
The average for most is about 50 centimeters . BWL students make up half of that . Lawyers , a little bit more . But not much . Kindergarten kids are better than adults . 
Who &apos;s most successful ? 
Architects . And engineers , luckily . 
1M : Is the highest ? What I &apos;ve seen 
and why ? Because you understand triangles . And self @-@ reinforcing geometric patterns are the key to building stable structures . 
CEOs are slightly above average . But here it gets interesting . 
You put an executive administrator on the team , they get significantly better . 
It &apos;s incredible . You look around and you see this team will win . You 
can predict that . Why is that ? 
Because you have special skills in process monitoring . 
You run the process . You understand it . 
And that team that regulates and pays attention to the work will significantly improve the performance of the team . 
Specialized skills and process skills and their combination will lead to success . 
If you have 10 teams that are typical , you get . CA : 6 : Stable structures . 
I tried something exciting . 
I thought , let &apos;s get the poker bet right away . 
So I offered a $ 10,000 prize for the winners software . 
What do you think happened ? With these design students , 
what was the result ? 
This didn &apos;t happen . A team had a stable structure . 
If anyone had built a two @-@ inch construction , he would have borne the prize home . 
So it &apos;s not interesting that high betting has a strong effect . 
We repeated this exercise with the same students . 
What do you think ? Did it happen ? 
Well , you understood the advantage of prototyping . 
So it turned out to be the same bad team . One of the best ones , 
they produced the highest construction in the least time . 
So there are profound lessons for us about the nature of propulsion and success . 
You may ask . Why would someone actually invest time ? Creating a Marshmallow Challenge , 
the reason is , I &apos;m helping create digital tools and processes to help teams . Create cars , video games and visual effects . 
And what the Marshmallow Challenge does is it helps you identify hidden assumptions . 
Because frankly , every project has its own Marshmallow . The 
challenge is a shared experience . A common language or attitude to build the right prototype . 
And this is the value of this experience . This is such a simple exercise , 
and those of you who are interested can . MarshmallowChallenge . COM : 
Visit : It &apos;s a blog where you can see . How to build the Marshmallows . 
There &apos;s a step @-@ by @-@ step guide there . 
You &apos;ll find crazy examples from all over the world . How people optimize the system . 
And refinement : There are also world records . 
And the basal lesson , I think , is the construction . In fact , a connecting sport is that 
it requires us to put all our senses on the task . And that we use our thinking optimally , like our feelings . And our doing in the challenge that lies ahead of us , 
and sometimes a small prototype . This experience , everything it takes . From an UH @-@ Oh to a TA @-@ DA moment , 
and that can make a big difference . 
Thank you . 
Let &apos;s pretend we have a machine , 
a big machine . A cool TED @-@ like machine , and that &apos;s a time machine . 
And everybody in this room has to go in , 
and you can go into the past . You can go into the future . You can &apos;t stay in the here and now . 
And I wonder what you &apos;re choosing . Because I &apos;ve been asking my friends a lot lately . And they all wanted to go into the past . 
I don &apos;t know . They wanted to go back to time before there were cars , or Twitter or America is looking for the superstar . 
I don &apos;t know . 
I &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re kind of drawn to nostalgia , wishful thinking . 
And I understand that . 
I &apos;m not part of this group , I have to say . 
I don &apos;t want to go back to the past , and I don &apos;t want to , because I &apos;m an adventurer . 
It &apos;s because opportunities on this planet don &apos;t go back . They go forward . 
So I want to go into this machine . And I want to go into the future . 
This is the greatest time that there has ever been on this planet . No matter what scale you &apos;re applying . Health , wealth . Mobility , opportunities , falling rates of disease . 
There has never been a time like this before . 
My great grandparents all died when they were 60 . 
My grandparents pushed this number to 70 . 
My parents are 80 on the heels . 
So there should be a nine at the beginning of my death . 
But it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing . As 
a child born today in New Delhi can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world . 100 years ago , 
think about it . This is an incredible fact . 
And why is this ? 
Skirts , smallpox , have killed billions of people on the planet . 
They have the demographics of the Earth . They have reformed in a way that no war . They &apos;ve ever managed . 
They &apos;re gone . They &apos;ve disappeared . 
We &apos;ve defeated them . Puff : 
In the rich world , there are diseases . The millions of us who have threatened just a generation ago . Hardly any diphtheria is rubbing 
polio . Does it know at 
all ? Somebody who &apos;s that ? 
Vaccines . Modern medicine . Our ability to feed billions of people . These are successes of the scientific method , 
and in my view , the scientific method is to try things out . Look at whether it works . It changes when it doesn &apos;t . One of the greatest achievements of humanity , 
that &apos;s the good news . 
Unfortunately , that &apos;s the good news . Because there are some other problems . And they &apos;ve been mentioned many times . 
And one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people in the world are hungry to bed every day . If 
that number goes up , and it goes up very quickly . And that &apos;s embarrassing . 
And not just that . We &apos;ve used our imagination to do that . We &apos;ve used this world to 
thoroughly devastate : Drinking water , primal land , rainforests , oil , gas . They disappear , and they disappear soon . And if we don &apos;t innovate out of this chaos , they disappear . 
So the question is , can we do that ? I think so . 
I think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food . The billions of people will feed without rape the land they live in . 
I think we can power this world . It &apos;s not destroying it at the same time . 
I really think so . And no . It &apos;s not wishful thinking . 
But this keeps me awake at night . One of the things that keeps me awake at night : We &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as much as we &apos;ve never done before . And 
we &apos;ve never been able to make it reasonable . We used to use it as we can today . 
We &apos;re on the threshold of amazing things . Amazing events . Many areas . And yet I really think that we &apos;re going to have to go back hundreds of 300 years before the Enlightenment to find a time . In which we &apos;ve been fighting progress where we &apos;ve been more vigorously pushing these things . On more fronts than we have now . 
People are shrouding in their faith . And so tightly , you can &apos;t liberate them . 
Not even the truth is going to happen . They liberate 
and hear them . Everybody has a right to their opinion . Even a right to their opinion on progress . 
But you know what they have no right to , 
they have no right to their own facts . You don &apos;t have a charge . 
And I took a while to figure out that out 
about a decade ago . I have written an article about vaccines for The New Yorker , a little article , 
and I was amazed to encounter resistance , resistance to what ended up being the most effective measure . In health care , in the history of humanity , 
I didn &apos;t know what to do . So I just did what I always do . I wrote an article and I went on . 
And soon afterwards , I wrote an article about genetically modified foods , the 
same thing . Just bigger , 
people were playing crazy . 
So I also wrote an article about it . And I couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that was franc food . Why did they think molecules were moving around in a certain way , rather than a random way , an attack on the territory of nature 
? But you know , I &apos;m doing what . I &apos;m doing . I wrote the article . I kept going . 
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist . 
We type , we &apos;re rich . We go eating . That &apos;s okay . 
But these articles worried me . And I couldn &apos;t figure out . Why ? And finally , I found out . 
And that &apos;s because these fanatics who made me crazy . They weren &apos;t fanatics at all . 
They were prudent people . Educated people , decent people . 
They were just like the people in this room . 
And that got me so confused . 
But then I thought , &quot; You know what ? Let &apos;s be honest . 
We &apos;ve got to a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress . As we used to 
talk . Intermediate . 
We talk ironically about it with small quotes . &quot; So progress , 
okay ? There are reasons for that . And I think we know what reasons that are . 
We have trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself . And there is no reason . Why ? Not . That &apos;s how 
you should be . You can just name a few names . And people will understand . 
Chernobyl , Bhopal , Challenger , Vioxx , weapons of mass destruction , the 2000 US presidential election . I mean , 
you know , you can choose your own list . 
There are questions . And problems with the people we thought were always right . So be skeptical . 
Ask questions : Ask for evidence . Ask evidence . 
Don &apos;t take anything for granted . 
But now , if you get evidence , you have to accept that evidence . And that &apos;s not good . 
And I can say that for the reason that we are now living in an epidemic of fear , as I &apos;ve never seen before . And hopefully never again . 
About 12 years ago , a story was published . A terrible story . The Autism epidemic with measles , mumps and rubells associated vaccine . 
Very scary , 
uplifting , in some ways , studies were done to see if that was true , 
upward studies . This is a serious matter . 
The data came in , 
the data came in from the United States , from England , from Sweden , from Canada , and they were all the same , no correlation . No connection , no connection at all . 
It doesn &apos;t matter . It doesn &apos;t matter because we believe in anecdotes . We believe what we see . What we believe to see , what makes us feel real . 
We don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents from a government agency that gives us data . And I understand that . I think we all do that . 
But you know what ? 
The result of that was catastrophic . 
Catastrophic because of that fact . The United States is one of the only countries in the world . In which the vaccine rate for measles is falling , 
that &apos;s scandalous . And we should be ashamed . 
It &apos;s terrible . 
What happened ? That we could do that . 
Well , I understand that . That &apos;s what I do . 
Because if somebody here has measles , they 
have one in the audience . The person who sees people die of measles 
doesn &apos;t happen very often . In this country , it 
doesn &apos;t happen at all . But 160,000 times in the world . Last year . 
These are many deaths from measles , 20 per hour . 
But because this hasn &apos;t happened here , we can displace it . And people like Jenny McCarthy can walk around . And messages of fear . And illiteracy of platforms like Oprah and Larry King preach live . And 
you can do that . Because they don &apos;t connect cause and correlation . 
They don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same . But almost never . The same thing is , 
and this is something we need to learn . And it &apos;s very fast . 
This guy was a hero . Jonas Salk : 
He liberated us from one of the worst scourges of humanity . Don &apos;t worry 
, no pain , polio . Puff disappeared . 
The guy in the middle , not so much . 
His name is Paul Offit . 
He &apos;s just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a few other people . 
He can live 400 , 500,000 children a year . In the developing world , he can 
save quite well . Not 
now . That &apos;s good . Apart from Paul walking around talking about vaccines and saying , &quot; How valuable they are . &quot; And that people should just stop . Complaining , 
and he actually says that , 
so Paul is a terrorist . So 
when Paul speaks at a public hearing , he cannot say without armed guards . 
He gets calls at home because people like to tell him they know where his kids are going to school . 
And why ? Because Paul made a vaccine . 
I don &apos;t need that . I don &apos;t need to say , but vaccines are essential . 
Take them away . Turn the diseases back . Terrible diseases . And that &apos;s what &apos;s happening right now . 
We have measles in this country now , 
and that &apos;s getting worse . And pretty soon , kids will die of it again . Because that &apos;s just a question of numbers . 
And they will not just die of measles . 
What about polio ? Let &apos;s take that . Why not ? 
A fellow militant of mine wrote to me a few weeks ago . And she said , &quot; She thinks I &apos;m a little too shrill . 
Nobody has ever said that before . 
&quot; She wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against polio . Absolutely not 
fine . 
Why ? Because we don &apos;t have polio . And you know what ? 
We didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday . 
Today , I don &apos;t know . Maybe this morning somebody went on an airplane in Lagos and is flying to Los Angeles . He &apos;s over Ohio right now . 
And he lands in a few hours . And he rents a car . And he comes to Long Beach , and he &apos;s going to be one of these fantastic TED dinner . And he &apos;s going to visit tonight , 
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a paralyzing disease . And we don &apos;t know . Because that &apos;s how the world works . 
Well , this is the planet we &apos;re living on . It &apos;s not as if it &apos;s not . 
We love to lie in . We love it , we have it . 
You all took your vitamins this morning : 
Echinacea , a small antioxidant . It helps you jump . 
I know you did that because half of Americans do that every day . 
You take the stuff , and you take alternative remedies , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference . How often we find that they &apos;re useless ? 
The data constantly records that . 
They evaporate their urine . They do more . Never before . 
That &apos;s okay . They like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine . 
I totally agree with you : 
Dark urine , dark . 
Why do we do that ? Why do we do that ? 
Well , I think I understand , we hate the pharmaceutical industry . 
We hate too strong a government . We don &apos;t have confidence in the system . 
And we shouldn &apos;t . Our healthcare system is bad . 
It &apos;s cruel to millions of people . 
It &apos;s absolutely amazing cold . And soulful , even to us who can afford it . 
So we &apos;re walking away from it , and where are we going ? 
We &apos;re walking into the arms of the placebo industry . 
That &apos;s great . I love the placebo industry . 
But you know , that &apos;s really a serious matter . Because the stuff is crap . And we spend billions of dollars on it . 
And I have all sorts of little props . Here &apos;s 
none of them . Gingko was cheating . Echinacea was cheating . Acai . I don &apos;t even know what that is . But we spend billions of dollars on it . It &apos;s cheating . 
And you know what ? When I say that , people scream at me and say , &quot; What cares you ? &quot; &quot; Let people do what they want . 
&quot; So they feel good . And 
you know what ? They &apos;re wrong 
because I don &apos;t care . Whether it &apos;s the Health Minister who says , &quot; Hmm , I &apos;m not going to accept the evidence of my experts on mammography or any cancer quack liver who wants to treat his patients with coffee intakes . 
&quot; If you go down that path , where faith and magic prove . And science replace , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be . 
You get to Thabo Mbeki in South Africa . 
He killed 400,000 of his people because he insisted that red beds , garlic and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs . We know they &apos;re able to slow down the course of AIDS . 
Hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country that is worse than any other one being plagued by this disease . 
Don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences . 
They have them . They always have the 
most brain @-@ free epidemic we &apos;re in right now , is this absurd battle between the advocates of genetically modified food and the bio @-@ elite . 
This is an idiotic debate . It has to stop . 
It &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors . 
This is ideology , not science . 
Everything we eat . Every grain of rice . Every branch of parsley . Every sprouts has been changed by people . 
You know , there were no mandarin in paradise . 
There were no cantaloupe melons . There were no Christmas trees . We did all of that . 
We &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years . 
And some of it worked . And some of it didn &apos;t . 
We got rid of it . What didn &apos;t work 
now , we can make it more accurate . And of course , there are risks . But we can do something like vitamin A in rice . And the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people . Extending their lives . 
They don &apos;t want that . 
I have to say , &quot; I understand . I don &apos;t . 
&quot; We reject genetically modified food . 
Why do we do that ? 
Well , what I hear all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture . We don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing . That &apos;s wrong . 
We don &apos;t want companies to patent lives . 
We don &apos;t want companies to own seeds . 
And you know what ? My answer to all of that is 
yes . You &apos;re right . Fix . We do . 
It &apos;s true . We have a huge food problem . But that &apos;s not science . 
That &apos;s not science . 
It &apos;s morality . Patent stuff . 
You know that science is not a company . 
It &apos;s not a country . 
It &apos;s not even an idea . It &apos;s a process . 
It &apos;s a process . And sometimes it works . And sometimes it doesn &apos;t . But the idea that we should not allow science to do its work because we &apos;re afraid is a real impasse . And it keeps millions of people from flourishing . 
You know , over the next 50 years , we will have to grow 70 percent more food . When at the moment 70 percent of 
this investment in Africa over the last 30 years has 
been shameful , shameful . 
You need that . And we &apos;re not giving it to you . 
And why genetically modified food ? 
We don &apos;t want to encourage people . We want to eat this rotten stuff , like Maniok Maniok , is 
something that half a billion people eat . 
It &apos;s like a potato . 
It &apos;s just a bunch of calories . It &apos;s bad . 
It doesn &apos;t have nutrients . It doesn &apos;t have protein . And scientists are building all this right in there . 
And then people could eat it . And wouldn &apos;t it be blind ? 
They wouldn &apos;t starve . And you know what ? 
That would be nice . It wouldn &apos;t be Chez Panisse . But it would be nice . 
And all I can say is , why do we fight this ? 
I mean , questions . We ask ourselves , why do we fight this ? 
Because we don &apos;t want to push genes around . 
It &apos;s not about pushing genes around . It &apos;s not about chemicals . 
It &apos;s not about our ridiculous ones . It &apos;s about passion for hormones . It &apos;s about insisting on more food . It &apos;s about better food . It &apos;s about unique food . 
It &apos;s not about rice . Crispies , it &apos;s about keeping people alive . And it &apos;s high time to understand what that means . 
Because you know what ? 
If we don &apos;t do that , if we keep on doing what we do . We owe ourselves to something that I don &apos;t think we want to be guilty of . High @-@ tech colonialism . 
There &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here . 
It &apos;s selfish . It &apos;s ugly . It &apos;s not worthy of us . And we really have to stop that . 
So after this incredibly fun conversation , you might want to say , &quot; Do you still want to be in this ridiculous time machine ? &quot; And go to the future 
anyway . I definitely want that . Right now , 
it &apos;s in the present . But we have an incredible opportunity . 
We can put this time machine on everything we want . 
We can move it where we want to move it . And we will move it there . Where we want , we need to . 
We need to have these conversations , and we need to think . But when we go into the time machine and go into the future , we will be happy . We will be happy to have done that . 
I know we can . And as far as I am concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs now . 
Thank you . 
Thank you . When Steve Lopez , a columnist of the Los Angeles Times , one day walked through the streets in central Los Angeles , he heard wonderful music . 
She came from a man , an African @-@ American , sympathetic , rough , homeless . He was playing on a violin that had only two strings left . 
Many of you will know the story . Because from Steve &apos;s article about it , later on , a book became . This was filmed again with Robert Downey Junior . When Steve Lopez and Jamie Foxx , when Nathaniel Anthony Ayers , the contrabass player who studied at the Juilliard Conservatory , And his promising career tragically early on through his paranoid career . Schizophrenia was ended . 
Nathaniel left Juilliard , suffered a nervous breakdown . And 30 years later , he lived as homeless on the streets of Skid Row in the center of Los Angeles . 
I recommend you read all the Steves book . Or watch the movie . So you can understand not only the wonderful connection that has emerged between these two men , but also how the music is . Making that connection helped and how it was the instrument . If this play of words is allowed , that &apos;s half . Nathaniel , getting away from the street . 
I met Mr. Ayers . In 2008 , two years ago , at Walt Disney Concert Hall . 
He just had a demonstration of Beethoven &apos;s first . And fourth symphony heard and came behind the stage to imagine myself . 
He spoke in a very cheerful and sociable tone about yo @-@ yo . MA : And Hillary Clinton , and about how the Dodgers never would make it into the Baseball World Series . And all of this because of the insidious passage of the first violin . In the last sentence of Beethoven &apos;s Fourth Symphony , 
&quot; We came to talk about music . &quot; And a few days later , I got an email saying that Nathaniel was interested in violin lessons with me . 
I have to mention that Nathaniel refused medical treatment . Because he was already with electric shocks and with Thorazin . And handcuffs were treated . Trauma . That haunted him all his life 
as a result . He &apos;s now particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases . They &apos;re sometimes so bad that they &apos;re threatening to tear him apart . And he &apos;s disappearing for days . In the streets of Skid Row , this horror is always wandering around and subjected to torture torment of his own mind , and in exactly 
the same stage of excitement , Nathaniel was when we were in the Walt Disney Concert Hall with our first lesson . He had this crazy flicker in his eyes . And he was totally lost . 
He talked about invisible demons and smoke , and about how someone wanted to poison him in sleep . 
I was afraid , not for my own sake , but I was afraid I could lose him , that he could sink into one of his states . And that I could destroy his relationship with the violin . When I started talking about clay ladders and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic . Violin pedagogy . 
So I just started playing . 
I played the first sentence of Beethoven &apos;s violin concerto , 
and as I played , I noticed that in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes , there was a complete change . 
It was as if he was under the influence of an invisible doctor . A chemical reaction of that catalyst . My game was Nathaniels . 
Manian anger turned into understanding , into a calm one . Curiosity and grace . 
And as if by a miracle , he took his violin . And he began to listen . Some clips of violin concerts to play . And then asked me to finish playing them . Mendelssohn Chaikovsky , Sibelius . 
And we started talking about music . From Bach to Beethoven . Brahms Bruckner . And all the others . BS : From Bartók to ESA @-@ Pekka Salonen , 
and I realized that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but also had a close personal relationship with it . 
He talked about her with passion and understanding . That I would otherwise only talk about my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic . 
Knowing by playing music and talking about music was confused by this paranoid . Man who was just pulled through the streets of Los Angeles . A lovely , educated , excellent musician trained in Juilliard . 
Music is medicine . Music changes us 
for Nathaniel means . Music is mental health , 
because music allows him to think . And delusions with the help of his imagination and creativity to transform it into something real . 
And so he escapes his tormenting state . 
I understood that this is the essence of art . 
This is precisely why we make music so that we can do something deep inside of us all . Our emotions through our artistic lens , through our creativity , can shape into reality . 
And the reality of that expression reaches us all . And moves , inspires . And unites us what 
Nathaniel was about . So music brought him back to a community of friends . 
The redeeming power of music brought him back . In a family of musicians who understood him , who recognized his talent and respected him , 
and I will play with Nathaniel again and again . Whether in Walt Disney Concert Hall or Skid Row , because he reminds me of it . Why ? I became a musician . 
Thank you very much . 
Bruno Giussani : Thank you very much . Thank you . 
Robert Gupta : 
Robert Gupta : I want to play something . I stole the cellist shamefully . 
I hope you forgive me . 
I &apos;m Jane McGonigal . I design computer games . 
I &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years now . And my goal for the next decade is to make it just as easy . Save the world in reality as saving it in online games is . 
I have a plan for that . I want to convince more people , including all of you , more time playing bigger ones . And more fun games . 
We &apos;re spending three billion hours a week now playing online . 
Some of you might think , well , that &apos;s a lot of time for games . 
Maybe a little too much time . If you think about how many problems we &apos;re going to solve in the real world as a matter of urgency . But 
in fact , according to my research at the Institute for the Future , that &apos;s exactly the opposite . Right ? 
Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the world &apos;s most pressing problems . 
In fact , I am convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to dramatically increase that time . 
I calculated that the time needed is 21 billion hours of playing time a week . 
That may seem a little bit absurd first . So I repeat it with that . It can work if we can solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity . I think we need to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week by the end of the next decade . 
No . I mean , it &apos;s really serious . 
Why ? This picture 
is pretty accurate . Why ? I think games are so vital to the survival of the human species . In the future , they &apos;re serious . 
This is a portrait of photographer Phil Toledano . 
He wanted to capture the feelings of playing . So he &apos;s in front of the players . He &apos;s built a camera . 
This is one of the classic expressions . 
When playing when you &apos;re not a player , you may miss some of the nuances in this picture . 
You probably see this sense of urgency , a little fear . But also extreme concentration . It &apos;s deepened . It &apos;s solving a really difficult problem . 
If you play , you see some nuances . Here are the upward @-@ drawn eyes and the mouth are a sign of optimism . The eyebrows show surprise . 
This is a player on the edge of what &apos;s called an epic victory . 
Oh , you know that . 
OK . Great . So we have some players . Here &apos;s 
an epic victory . Is a result ? It &apos;s so very positive that you didn &apos;t know before that it was possible at all . 
It was almost beyond imagination , and if you get there , you &apos;re shocked that you &apos;re actually capable of doing 
that . This is an epic victory . 
This player is about to win an epic victory . 
And this is what we &apos;re seeing on millions of faces of problem solvers around the world . If we tackle the hurdles of the next century , the face of those who face all odds . Standing on the edge of an epic victory . 
Well , unfortunately , we see this face more . In real life , when we face difficult problems . 
I call it &quot; being in life . &quot; I mean &quot; bad face . 
&quot; And it &apos;s actually my face . You see , yeah . OK . 
That &apos;s me . How I do that ? In life , I &apos;m bad face . 
This is a graffiti in my former home country . In Berkeley , California , where I studied in my Ph.D. thesis why we &apos;re better at playing than in real life . 
This is a problem . We think that many players don 
&apos;t think we &apos;re as good in reality as we are in play . And 
I mean , not only less successful . Although that &apos;s part of it , 
we &apos;re doing more in game worlds . 
I mean , good at motivating us to do something meaningful . Inspired at working with each other . 
If we &apos;re in a game world , I think many of us are turning into our best version , always and immediately ready to help , persistent . The problem to solve is to try to do it as long as necessary after failure . Try it again 
and in reality . If we fail , if we encounter obstacles , we often feel different . 
We feel overwhelmed . We feel defeated . We feel threatened . Maybe depressed , frustrated . Or cynically , 
we never have those feelings . If we play games in games , they just don &apos;t exist . 
And that &apos;s what I wanted to study as a PhD student . 
Why is it in games ? It &apos;s impossible to think . You couldn &apos;t just achieve everything . 
How can we put these feelings from games into reality ? 
So I looked at games like World of Warcraft , which is the ideal environment for solving problems together . 
And I noticed a few things : Epic victories in online worlds . 
So , make it possible , first of all , when you start playing one of these online games , especially at World of Warcraft . There are a lot of different characters ready to give you a world saving mission . And they do so immediately . 
But not just any mission , but a mission . They fit perfectly with your current level in the game . 
Right ? So they do . 
They never get a task . They can &apos;t solve it . 
But always on the edge of their abilities , so they have to make an effort . 
But there &apos;s no unemployment . In World of Warcraft , you &apos;re not sitting around . And you turn around , you have fools , you always have a targeted . You have to do something important . And 
there are , in a way , employees . 
Whatever they go , there are people who work . Hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to complete their epic mission . 
We don &apos;t have that easy in real life . This feeling that , when you have a fingercut , you have employees who are willing to do it . 
And there &apos;s this epic story . This inspiring story , why we &apos;re there and what we have to do . And then we get all this positive feedback . 
You &apos;ve probably heard about level up and level 1 strength . Or 1 intelligence . 
This constant feedback is not in real life . 
When I leave this stage , I don &apos;t have 1 speech . And 1 crazy idea . 20 crazy idea . 
I get in real life . 
So this feedback , not so . The problem of cooperation online worlds . Like World of Warcraft , it &apos;s so satisfying . Being on the edge of an epic victory at any time , that we prefer to spend all our time in these game worlds . 
They &apos;re just better than reality . 
To date , all World of Warcraft players have come together . 5.93 million years . So spent solving the virtual problems of Azeroth . 
It &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing . 
It may sound bad . 
But to look at it in context , 5.93 million years ago , it started . Our first primate ancestors were going up , 
the first upright primacy . So OK , 
so when we talk about how much time we spend playing at the moment , it &apos;s going to be . That &apos;s just meaning . When do you get to know the time for the scale of human development ? When do you think about what &apos;s extraordinary ? But 
it &apos;s also appropriate . Because it turns out that by going on playing this whole time , we &apos;re playing . In fact , changing what we as humans are able to do . 
We &apos;re becoming too cooperative . Thinking , heartfelt beings . 
That &apos;s the truth . That &apos;s what I believe . 
Take a look at these interesting statistics . The recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University . The average young person today spends in a country with a strong playing culture . 10,000 hours playing online until the age of 21 . 
So 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons . 
First of all , for kids in the United States , 10,080 hours is the exact total time they spend in school , from the fifth grade to the end of high school . If you never miss it , 
so here we have a complete parallel education path where young people learn the same way . What it means to be a good player . Like anything else they learn in school . And maybe 
some of you have the new book by Malcolm Gladwell . Overflying , so you know his theory of success . The theory of success of 10,000 hours . 
It &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science that if we spend 10,000 hours studying any subject with the laborious of any subject until the age of 21 . We master it , 
we become as good at doing whatever . Like the most important people in the world . 
So what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are master players , 
so the big question is , what exactly are players masterful ? Good . Because 
if we could figure out that out , we would have virtually never before had any human potential at our disposal . 
So many people we have in the world right now . We have those who spend at least an hour a day playing online . 
These are our master players , 500 million people , who are exceptionally good at something . 
And over the next decade , we have another billion players . The exceptionally good at whatever . 
If you haven &apos;t heard it yet , 
the game industry has developed . Consoles that save energy and work on mobile networks , rather than broadband Internet , so that players around the world , especially India , China , Brazil , can play online . 
You &apos;re expected to have an additional billion players . Over the next decade , 
we &apos;ve got a total of 1.5 billion players . 
So I started thinking about what it is . What do we do with 
these games ? Here &apos;s the four things I found . First , urgency optimism , 
OK . Imagine how extreme self @-@ motivation . 
Urgent optimism is desire to do something right away . Made a hurdle . Together with the belief that we have a reasonable hope for success . 
Players always believe that an epical victory is possible . And that it &apos;s always worth it . Trying to do it , and that &apos;s the 
same : Players don &apos;t sit around . 
Players are champions in spiders . Poet social networks . 
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research . They show that we like people more after we played with them . Even if they beat us badly , 
the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play a game with someone . 
We trust that someone spends time with us , that the rules are being respected , that we have the same goal . And then , until the end of the 
game , that allows us to play together . The growth of ties , trust and cooperation . 
As a result , we build stronger social relationships , happy 
productivity . Fantastic . 
You know , there &apos;s a reason . Why ? The average word of Warcraft player , 22 hours a week , plays as part @-@ time job , 
so to speak . The reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier . Working hard than when we relax or do nothing . 
We know that we work optimally as human beings . When we do hard , significant work , 
and players are always ready to work hard . When they get the right job and 
ultimately love epic meaning , 
players . It &apos;s part of awe . It &apos;s a command to become planetary missions . 
Here &apos;s a background information to put that in perspective . You probably know all Wikipedia . The biggest Wiki in the world . The 
second largest Wiki in the world . With almost 80,000 entries , the World of Warcraft is . 
Wiki : Five million . People use it every month . 
They have more information about World of Warcraft . Collected on the Internet than about any other topic in any other Wiki . The world . 
They create an epic story . 
They create an epic source of knowledge about the World of Warcraft . 
OK . So these are four superpowers . They lead to a single result : Players are super @-@ powerful , hopeful individuals . 
They are people who believe that as individuals they can change the world . 
And the only problem is they believe they can change the virtual worlds . But not the real ones . 
That &apos;s the problem . The one I &apos;m trying to solve , 
Edward Castronova , is a scientist . 
His work is awesome . 
He &apos;s studying why people have so much time , energy . And he &apos;s spending money on online worlds , 
and he says , &quot; We &apos;re witnessing no less than mass emigration to virtual worlds . &quot; And online gaming environments , 
and this from an economist , so he &apos;s logical . 
And he &apos;s not saying like me . I &apos;m developing games . I &apos;m a little bit exuberant . 
So he says , &quot; That makes sense . &quot; Because players can do more in online worlds than in real life . 
They can build stronger social ties in games . Than in real life , they get more feedback . And rewards in games . So when in real life , 
he says , &quot; It &apos;s perfectly logical right now that players have more time in the virtual world than in real life . 
&quot; I agree with that first . That &apos;s logical . 
But it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation . 
We need to start turning the real world into a game . 
My inspiration comes from an event . It &apos;s 2,500 years back . 
There are these ancient cubes of sheep &apos;s cookes . You know , 
before these fantastic game econtrollers , there were sheep &apos;s cocks , 
and these were , so to speak , the first people to develop . Play equipment , and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus . You might know this story ? The story about how and why games were invented . 
According to Herodotus , games became more accurate craps in the kingdom of Lydia . During a famine 
, there was supposedly such a great famine that the king of Lydia turned into a crazy idea that 
people suffered , people fought . 
It was an extreme situation . It took an extreme solution . 
So they invented according to Herodotus . The dice game and agreed a national strategy : In one day you would eat , the next day you would . You would play , 
and they would be so deeply immersed in the dice game . Because games are so fascinating and surrounded by satisfying , happy productivity that they would forget that there was nothing to eat . 
And then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat . 
And according to Herodotus , they survived for 18 years . This famine by eating one day and playing the next . 
So I think we &apos;re playing games today . 
We &apos;re playing games to escape the suffering of the real world . We &apos;re playing games to escape everything . It doesn &apos;t work in the real world . It doesn &apos;t satisfy anything that &apos;s not in real life . And we get what we need from the games . 
But that doesn &apos;t have to be the end . 
That &apos;s the exciting thing . 
According to Herod , after 18 years of famine , it didn &apos;t get any better . So the king decided to start a final dice game . 
They divided the kingdom into two halves . 
They played a dice game . And the winners were allowed to break into an epic adventure , 
they left lydia and they went looking for a new home . They just left so many people behind . How there were food to survive . And they went to look for the rest of a place where they could thrive . 
That sounds crazy , right ? 
But the latest DNA evidence shows that the Etruscans who later formed the Roman Empire . The same DNA as the ancient Lydians . 
So scientists recently came to the conclusion that herodotus is actually a crazy story . 
And geologists found evidence of global cooling . It took almost 20 years to explain the famine . 
So this crazy story could be true . Maybe 
they actually saved their people by playing by logging into games for 18 years . And then they had this inspiration and learned so much about playing with each other that they saved the whole civilization . 
So we can . 
We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft since 1994 . 
This was the first real @-@ time strategy game . The World of Warcraft series . 
This was 16 years ago . 
They played craps for 18 years . We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft for 16 years . 
I &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game . 
So they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world . So I take my 21 billion hours of play a week . 
We should agree that half of us have an hour of play a day . Until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world . 
I know you &apos;re going to ask , how do we solve problems ? The real world in games . And 
that &apos;s exactly the question I &apos;ve been working on in recent years at the Institute for the Future . 
We &apos;ve got this banner in our office in Palo Alto . It &apos;s how we should understand the future . 
We don &apos;t want to try to tell the future 
what we want before . Is the future to 
be created ? We want to imagine the best possible outcome . And then empower people to turn this idea into reality . 
We imagine epic victories and give people the opportunities . To achieve them . 
I &apos;ll show you three games very briefly . The ones I designed to try to make people epic victories in their own future . 
This is &quot; World without Oil . 
&quot; The game is from 2007 . 
It &apos;s an online game where you have to overcome an oil shortage , 
and oil scarcity is invented . But we have enough online content with it . It becomes realistic for you , and it becomes your real life . In fact , without oil , so if you sign up for the game , tell us where you live . And then you get real @-@ time news movies . They show you how much oil costs , which is not there . How food supplies are affected , 
how transportation is affected . Whether schools are closed , whether there are riots . And you have to figure out how to shape your real life . If it were true , and we ask you to blog about it , to hire videos or photos . 
We have this game tested with 1,700 players in 2007 . And we &apos;ve been accompanying them for the last three years . 
And I can tell you , it was a changing experience . 
Nobody wants to change their lives . Because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should . 
But if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and you &apos;re told , &quot; Get us going . &quot; The oil from -- 
this is a fascinating adventure . 
You can find out how they survive . Would most of our players have ? Keep the habits learned in the game . 
So we &apos;ve got to go for the next world saving game . We &apos;ve set ourselves a bigger , higher goal than just oil shortages . 
We &apos;ve got the Superstruct game at the Institute for the Future . 
The starting point is to calculate a supercomputer that humans will only have 23 years left on the planet . 
This supercomputer is called the Global Dismortality Sensitization System . Of course , 
the call to players to sign up . Did we almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie ? 
You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies , where there &apos;s the dream team . You have the astronaut , the scientist , the ex @-@ Sträfling , and only together can you save the world . 
But in our game , instead of just five people , we say , &quot; Everyone is on the dream team . &quot; And it &apos;s our job to build the future for energy , food , health , safety and the future of social justice . 
8,000 players played the game . For eight weeks . 
They found 500 incredible . Creative solutions that they can read . If you Google Superstruct and 
the last game , we &apos;ll release it on March 3rd . It &apos;s a game in collaboration with the World Bank . 
If you complete the game , you get the World Bank Award for Social Reformer 2010 . 
We work with universities all over Sub @-@ Saharan Africa . And invite you to learn how to redesign socially . 
We have a comic book on this . We have levels high for regional . Understanding knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and ingenuity . 
I want to invite you all . To share this game with young people . All over the world , especially in developing areas that benefit from this , together . Imagine your own social enterprise to save the world . 
So I &apos;m going to finish . 
I want to ask you something : 
What do you think is happening ? Next , 
we have all these fantastic players . We have games that show us . What we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet . 
Well , I hope you agree with me that players are human resources . We can use them to work in real life . And that games have a big impact on change . 
We have all these superpowers , happy productivity . The ability to build tight social networks , urgency optimism and the desire for epiepical meaning . 
I really hope that together we play important games to build another century on this planet . 
And I hope you will design such games with me . And play 
when I look forward to the next decade . I &apos;m sure about two things : That we can create every imaginable future . And that we can play all kinds of games . So I say , let &apos;s play the world @-@ changing games . 
Let &apos;s start . 
Thank you . I &apos;ve been interested in Placebo for some time . It may seem strange that a magician is interested in this . Unless you look at it like me , it &apos;s a deception . It becomes something real when someone just believes it hard enough , 
in other words , has sugar pills . In some studies , a measurable effect has been shown to have the placebo effect , and that &apos;s just because of it . Because the person thinks what happens to her is . A pharmaceutical or some kind of pain management , for example , if the patient believes it hard enough , there &apos;s a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect . 
A deception becomes something real because someone perceives it so 
that we want to understand each other . Now I &apos;m going to show you a basic , very simple magic trick . 
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . This is a trick that has been used for kids in every magic book since at least the 1950s . 
I myself have it from the Cub Scout Magic . The scout in the 1970s , 
I &apos;m going to do it for you . And then explain it , 
and then I &apos;m going to explain why I explain it . 
So you see what happens . 
The knife . You can look at my hand that you can look at . 
I &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my fist . 
I &apos;m pushing my sleeves back 
and to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeves or comes out of it . I &apos;m just going to push my wrist right here , 
so you can see that there &apos;s no movement at all . As long as I &apos;m pressurized here , nothing can go in my sleeves or come out . 
And the goal is very simple . 
I &apos;m going to open my hand . And hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife is held by my bare physical magnetism . 
It &apos;s actually so firmly in its place that I can shake it . Without the knife falling down , nothing moves 
into my sleeve or comes out . No trickery . And you can study everything . 
TA @-@ DA : 
Now , this is a trick I often teach small kids . They &apos;re interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception . If you look more closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick to do . 
I think many of you here in the room probably know . This trick , 
it works . Here &apos;s how 
I hold the knife in my hand . 
I say I close my wrist to make sure that nothing disappears or comes out in my sleeve , and that &apos;s a lie . 
The reason I tie my wrist is because of this . That &apos;s the real secret of illusion . 
The moment I turn my hand away from you , so you see it from behind , this finger moves . Here , my index finger just moves from where it was . In a position where it &apos;s so stretched 
out , great 
trick . There &apos;s somebody sitting behind there who had no 
childhood , so he &apos;s here . Right ? 
And when I turn around , the finger changes its position , 
and now you could talk about it . Why ? That &apos;s a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there are only three fingers down here , because the mind and the way it processes information . It doesn &apos;t count individually . One , two , three , but it sees it as a group . 
But that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about . Now , actually , not at all . And then open . I mean , hand . 
Of course , it &apos;s held there . But not by the magnetism of my body , but by a trick , by my index finger , which is there now . 
And when I close my hand , the same thing happens by turning back . And by this movement , it &apos;s hidden that the finger is moving back . 
I take this hand away , and here &apos;s the knife . 
This trick is you can show to your friends and neighbors . Thank you . 
Now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ? 
A year ago or so , I read a study that really bypassed me . 
I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that &apos;s why it was for me . It was an amazing thing . Because 
it was this . It turned out that if you offer a placebo in the form of a white pill , you can do it . In the form of an aspirin tablet , it &apos;s simple . A round white pill that has a certain measurable effect . 
But if you give the shape in which you give the placebo , for example , to a smaller pill , you change it . And you color this blue and you embosse a letter on it , it &apos;s actually measurably more effective . 
And that , though none of them are any pharmaceutical ones , they &apos;re just sugar pills . 
But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill . 
What made me really freak out of it . 
But it turned out that &apos;s not all of it . 
If you take capsules , they &apos;re even more effective than tablets . Any shape , 
a colored capsule , at one end yellow . And at the other red is better than a white capsule . 
Dosage also plays a role . 
A pill twice a day is not as good as three pills . I can &apos;t get to the exact statistics now . Remember , I &apos;m sorry . 
The key thing . But 
is that dosage also plays a role . 
And the shape plays a role . 
And if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to grab the needle . 
Right ? An injection with an ineffective one . A few milliliters of an ineffective substance that you inject into a patient . 
This creates a very strong image . In the head , this is much stronger than a white pill . 
This graph is really . I &apos;m going to show you another time . So if we have a projector , 
the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill . It doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule . It doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle . 
And none of this has any really pharmaceutical property . It &apos;s just our belief in it that has a stronger effect in us . 
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a magic trick . 
I take something that is obviously a deception . And let it look real . 
We know from that study that you have to grab a needle . If you want to get to the point , 
this is an 18 @-@ inch @-@ long needle . It &apos;s very , very sharp . And I &apos;m going to sterilize it a little bit first . 
This is really my flesh . It &apos;s not Damian &apos;s special farmed meat . 
This is my skin . This is not a special effect . Hollywood : 
I &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin . And drive through it until it &apos;s leaving on the other side . 
If it &apos;s going to get you sick , if you &apos;re easily fainted . I have a couple of friends . Last night , I showed it in the hotel room . And some people I didn &apos;t know . And there &apos;s a woman almost fainthead . 
So I propose , if you &apos;re getting sick quickly , look away for the next 30 seconds , or you know what ? I &apos;m going to get the first delicate part . You can 
see it in a moment . You can also look away if you want . So it 
&apos;s going to be so accurate . Here &apos;s where my meat starts . On the lower part of my arm , I &apos;m just going to make a little bit of a break . 
I &apos;m really sorry . Is it going to do that ? 
Crazy . And now . Just a little bit . Through my skin and on the other side , out again . 
Now we &apos;re actually in the same situation . We had the knife trick , 
about , 
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers . Or ... So I 
&apos;m going to show you . This is one , two , three , four , five . 
Well , 
I know what people think . If you see that , 
you say , &quot; Okay . &quot; It &apos;s certainly not so stupid . And it just stifles through the skin for a few minutes to entertain us . 
Well , then I &apos;ll show you . 
What does that look like ? Well , it looks pretty good . 
Yes . I know . And people in the back say , &quot; Okay . &quot; I didn &apos;t really see that . People 
in the adjoining rooms are now coming in . 
Let me show you . Close up , this is 
really my skin . This is not a special effect . 
Hollywood . This is my flesh . And I can turn this around . 
Sorry if you get bad . Look away . Don &apos;t look at it . The 
people in the back , or the ones who later . Once they see it on video , they say , &quot; Well , yeah , that looks pretty good . &quot; Impressive . But if it were real , he would see . You see , here &apos;s a hole . And there , if it was really real , it would bleed . Okay . 
Let me squeeze out a little blood for you . 
Yeah , here it is . 
Normally , I would take out the needle now . 
I would clean my arm . And show you that there are no wounds there . 
But I think in this frame here , and with the intention of making something real out of deception . Will I just take the needle ? Let it in there . And so , from the stage , 
we &apos;ll be going to meet again a few times in the next few days . 
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . Thank you very much . 
So I &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life . 
I just loved two . 
This first one was more like a passionate affair . 
It was a nice fish , tasty , good consistency , rich . A bestseller on the menu . 
What a fish . 
Even better . It became aquaculture according to the supposedly highest standards of sustainability . 
So you could feel comfortable selling it . 
I had a relationship with this beauty for several months . 
One day , the company &apos;s boss called and asked if I could speak at an event . About the sustainability of the farm . 
Of course , I said , 
&quot; Here was a company . That was trying to solve what this unimaginable problem was . For our chefs , how do we keep fish on our menus ? 
&quot; In the last 50 years . We fished the seas , how we beat forests bare . 
It &apos;s hard to overestimate the destruction . 
90 percent of the big fish we love , the tuna , the curative butte , the salmon , the swordfish . They &apos;ve collapsed . 
There &apos;s almost nothing left . 
So aquaculture is probably going to become , or bad aquaculture , fishing . It &apos;s going to be part of our future . 
Many arguments against fishing facilities polluting the environment , most of them anyway . And they &apos;re inefficient . Let &apos;s take tuna at a great disadvantage . 
It &apos;s got 15 percent feed recovery . 
That means 15 pounds of wild fish are needed . So you get one pound of farmed tuna , 
not very sustainable tastes . 
Not very good either . 
So here was finally a company trying to get it right . 
I wanted to support it . 
The day before the event , I called the head of public relations for the company , to name it . 
We call him Don Don 
, I just said the facts . Right ? You &apos;re famous for that . Growing out in the sea so far that you don &apos;t pollute the environment 
. That &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; We &apos;re so far out that the waste is distributed by our fish . Not concentrated . &quot; 
And then he added . &quot; We &apos;re essentially a world of our own . 
This 2.5 to one feed recovery , &quot; he said , 
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot; 
2.5 to . One great 
2.5 to . One thing that feeds . Your 
sustainable proteins , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Great . &quot; I said , &quot; I lay up , 
and that evening I lay in bed . And I thought , &quot; What the hell is a sustainable protein ? 
&quot; So the next day , I called . Shortly before the Don event . 
I said , &quot; Don , what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot; 
He said , &quot; He doesn &apos;t know . &quot; He &apos;s going to ask . 
Well , I telephoned a few people in the company . Nobody could give me a good answer . Until I finally telephoned with the leading biologist , 
we call him Don Don , too . 
&quot; I said , &quot; What , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot; 
Well , he mentioned some algae and some fishmeal , and then he said , &quot; Chicken pellets . &quot; 
I said , chicken pellets . &quot; 
He said , &quot; Yes . &quot; Feathers , skin , bone meal . Remnants dried . And processed into food . 
I said , &quot; How much percent of your food is chicken ? &quot; 
Assuming maybe two percent ? 
Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , he said . 
I said , &quot; Don . &quot; What &apos;s sustainable about this ? Feeding chicken to fish ? There 
was a long break in the pipeline , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . 
I fell in love with this fish . 
No . Not because I &apos;m a self @-@ righteous connoisseur . And , well , that 
&apos;s me . 
No . I really fell in love with this fish because I swear to God , the fish tasted chicken after 
this conversation . This second fish , this is another kind of love story . 
It &apos;s the romantic species , the way you ever better do it . You get to know your fish , the more you love the fish . 
I first ate it in a restaurant in southern Spain . 
A friend journalist had long talked about this fish . 
She kind of cuffed us . 
He came on the table with a bright , almost shimmering white color . 
The cook had cooked it . 
Hold twice . 
Amazingly , he was still delicious . 
Who can make a fish ? So good . Taste . After he was cooked , 
I can &apos;t . But this guy can call it . 
We call it Miguel . In fact , he &apos;s called Miguel . 
And no . He didn &apos;t cook the fish . And he &apos;s not a chef . At least in the way you and I understand it . 
He &apos;s a biologist at Veta la Palma . 
This is a fish rearing in the southwest corner . Spain , 
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river . Guadalquivir , 
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of Argentines . 
They grew meat cattle on what were essentially wetlands . 
They did this by draining the land . 
They built this complicated sequence of canals . And they pushed water out of the country . And out into the river . 
Now , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not economically . 
And ecologically , it was a disaster . 
It killed about 90 percent of the birds , which is a lot of birds for this place . 
And so in 1982 , a Spanish company with environmental awareness . Bought the land . 
What did they do ? 
They reversed the river of water . 
They literally relaid the lever . 
Instead of pushing out the water , they used the channels to do it . Put the water back in . 
They flooded the channels . 
They created an 11,000 hectares of fish rearing , perch , sea ash , shrimp , eel . And in doing so , Miguel and his company completely reverse the ecological destruction . 
The farm is incredible . 
I mean , they &apos;ve never seen anything like this before . 
They &apos;re staring out onto the horizon a million miles away . And all you see are flooded canals . And this dense , lush march , 
I was there , not long ago , with Miguel . 
He &apos;s an incredible guy . Three parts : Charles Darwin . And one part : A crocodile for kissing . 
Okay . There we were . And we fought through . The wetlands and I chastise . And sweat has mud up to my knees . And Miguel keeps calm . A biology lecture . 
Here he highlights a rare track . Now mentioned . 
He mentions the mineral needs of phytoplankton , 
and here he sees a pattern of bundles . That &apos;s what he calls the Tanzanian giraffe . 
It turns out Miguel has most of his career in Mikumi National Park in Africa . 
I asked him how he has become such a fish expert . 
He said , &quot; Fish , I don &apos;t know about fish . 
I &apos;m an expert in relationships . And 
then he goes . &quot; And he falls into more talk of rare birds and algae . And strange aquatic plants , 
and don &apos;t get me wrong . That was really fascinating . You know , the biotic community , unplugged . So , in the way 
it &apos;s great . But I was in love . 
And my head got weak over this cooked piece of delicious fish . The one I had on the eve , 
so I interrupted it . I said , Miguel . How does it come that your fish tastes so good ? He 
pointed to the algae . 
I know boy , the algae of phytoplankton , the relationships . That &apos;s incredible . 
But what do your fish eat ? 
How is the feed recovery ? Well 
, he goes on . I tell you that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild . 
The plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , that &apos;s what the fish feed . 
The system is so healthy . It &apos;s completely self @-@ explanatory . 
There &apos;s no food . 
Ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals . 
Later that day , I drove around on this plot with Miguel . And I asked him , &quot; I said , for a place that seems so natural , unlike any farm I &apos;d ever been on . How do you measure success ? &quot; 
At that moment , it was as if a film director had demanded a stage change . 
And we were bowing around the corner . And we had the most incredible sight . Thousands and thousands of pinkers , flamingos , literally pinker carpet . As far as the eye can see . 
That &apos;s success . He said , 
&quot; Look at their bellies . &quot; Pink , 
they &apos;re slugging . Sludge 
. I was completely confused . 
I said , Miguel . Don &apos;t sludge your fish . Yes 
. He said , &quot; We &apos;re losing 
20 percent of our fish . And fish eggs to birds . 
&quot; Well , last year , there were 600,000 birds on this site . More than 250 different species . 
It &apos;s the largest one today . And one of the most important private bird reserves in Europe . 
I said , &quot; Miguel is a good thing . Fourishing bird population , not . The last one . &quot; You want to have this on a fish farm . He 
shook his head . No . 
He said , &quot; We &apos;re building extensively , not intensive . 
This is an ecological network . 
The flamingos eat the shrimps . 
The shrimps eat the phytoplankton . 
So the closer the belly , the better . &quot; 
The system , okay ? Let &apos;s think about this . A farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals . And a farm that measures its success in the health of its predators . 
A fish rearing . But also a bird reserve . 
Oh . And by the way , these flamingos shouldn &apos;t even be there from the outset . 
They breed in a city 240 kilometers away , where the soil is better . For nest maintenance 
every morning , they fly 240 kilometers to the farm . 
And every night , they fly 240 kilometers . Back . 
They do that . Because they follow the white line that &apos;s yesterday on the A92 highway . 
Seriously . 
I had imagined a kind of penguins journey . So I looked at Miguel . 
I said , Miguel , fly 240 kilometers . The farm , and fly them . 240 kilometers back . In the 
evening , they do that for the kids . He 
looked at me as if I had just quoted Whitney Houston &apos;s song . 
He said , &quot; No , they do that because the food is better . &quot; 
I didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish . It was delicious , and I don &apos;t like the skin of fish . I don &apos;t like it . I don &apos;t like it sucks . It &apos;s crispy . 
It &apos;s this biting , charcoal taste . 
I almost never cook with it . And 
yet , when I tried it in this restaurant in southern Spain , it didn &apos;t taste for fish skin at all . 
It tasted sweet . And it tastes pure as if you took a bite from the ocean . 
I mentioned that to Miguel . And he nodded . 
He said , &quot; The skin looks like a sponge . 
&quot; It &apos;s the last defense . Before anything enters the body , 
it evolved over the course of evolution to suck up impurities , 
and then he added , &quot; But our water has no impurities . Okay 
. A farm . &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t feed your fish . &quot; &quot; A farm . &quot; &quot; The farm that measures your success in the success of your predators . 
&quot; And then I realized . When he says , &quot; A farm that doesn &apos;t have impurities , it undermines enormously . &quot; Because the water that flows through this farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River . 
It &apos;s a river that carries all these things with it . From which rivers nowadays tend to lead them with them . Chemical pollutants , outflow of pesticides , 
and when it &apos;s fought through the system and leaves it , the water is cleaner than it has come in . 
The system is so healthy . It cleans the water . 
So not only a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals . Not only a farm that measures its success in the health of its predators , but a farm that is literally a water treatment plant . And not only for these fish , but also for you . And me , 
because when the water flows out , it sinks into the Atlantic , 
a drop in the ocean . But I know , I take it , and you should . Because this love story , however romantic , is also instructive . 
You could say it &apos;s a recipe . For the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about perch or meat cattle . 
What we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , of one in which food is . In fact , taste good . 
But for many people , it &apos;s a little too radical . 
We &apos;re not realists . We enjoy . We &apos;re lovers . 
We love weekly markets . We love small family businesses . We talk about regional food . We eat organic food , 
and if you say that &apos;s the things that insure the future of good food . Someone somewhere up and says , &quot; Hey guys , I love pink . &quot; Flamingos : But how are you going to feed the world ? How 
are you going to feed the world ? 
Can I be honest . 
I don &apos;t like this question . 
No . Not because we &apos;re already producing enough calories to feed the world more than just feed . 
A billion people are going to starve today . 
A billion . That &apos;s more than ever because of stark inequalities in distribution , not total production . 
Now , I don &apos;t like this question because it &apos;s the logic of our food system that has been going on for the last 50 years . 
Feed grain to vegetable eaters . Pesticides to monocultures , chemicals . The Earth hens to fish , and all the time the agricultural industry has just asked . If we feed more people cheaper , how horrible can that be ? That 
was the reason . It was the justification . It was the business plan of American agriculture . 
We should call it . What it is is a liquidation business . A business that quickly takes up ecological capital . That allows precisely that production , 
that &apos;s not a business . And it &apos;s not agriculture . 
Our grain chamber is threatened today . It &apos;s not because of decreasing supply , but because of decreasing resources , 
not because of the latest mowers . And tractor inventions , but because of fertile land , not because of pumps , but because of fresh water . Not because of chainsaws , but because of forests . And not because of fishing boats and nets , but because of fish in the sea . They 
want to feed the world . 
Let &apos;s start with the question : How are we going to feed ourselves ? 
Or better . How can we create conditions ? Which each community can feed itself 
to do that . Don &apos;t look at the agricultural industrial model for the future . 
It &apos;s really old . And it &apos;s done : Capital , chemistry . 
And machines are on top of it , and it never has anything really good . It &apos;s produced for food , and 
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model . 
This is the one that uses two billion years of work experience . 
Look at Miguel . Farmers like Miguel , 
farms . The non @-@ worlds are businesses that restore themselves . Instead of using up farms that grow extensively , instead of just intensive farmers who are not just producers , but experts in relationships . 
Because they are the ones who are experts on taste . 
And if I &apos;m really honest , they &apos;re a better cook than I &apos;ll ever be . 
You know , I &apos;m right . Because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious . 
Thank you . 
I grew up with a lot of science fiction that drove 
in my school days . I went to school by bus every day . One hour per way . And my 
nose was always in a book , a science fiction book . That kidnapped my thoughts into other worlds . And in a narrative way , I was satisfied with my insatiable curiosity , deep inside of 
me . And that curiosity also turned out to be that whenever I wasn &apos;t in school , I wandered through the woods . And rehearsals collected frogs . And snakes . And beetle And pond water brought everything home . And under the microscope , 
I looked at it , I was totally science @-@ excited . 
You know , it was always about trying to understand the world . And exploring the limits of what was possible , 
and my love of science fiction seemed to reflect in my environment . Because back in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon . And we explored the deep sea . 
Jacques Cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows , which are animals . And places and a world of wonders that we could never have imagined before . 
And that probably fits very well with that science fiction role . 
And I was an artist . 
I could draw . I could paint , 
and because it &apos;s neither video games nor this saturation with computer @-@ generated movies , nor the whole visual language . In the media landscape , I had to create the images in my head . 
That &apos;s what we all had to do at the time . When we read a book as children , we took the author &apos;s description and projected it . It was on the canvas in our heads . 
My reaction to that was drawing and painting aliens . Aliens worlds , robots , spacecraft and so on . 
What in math class I was constantly caught by the teacher . 
How I was painting hidden behind the textbook , the creativity had to sort of get out of it . 
And something interesting happened . Because what fascinated me about Jacques Cousteau &apos;s shows was the idea of a world that we knew completely unseen . Here on our planet . 
Even certainly , I would never reach an alien world with a spaceship . That seemed pretty unlikely to me . 
But here was a world that I could actually enter . Here on Earth . And it was just as fascinating . And exotic as all of that . What I &apos;d always imagined when I read these books . 
So when I was 15 , I decided to become a diver . 
The only problem with this was that I lived in a small village in Canada , 1,000 kilometers from the next ocean . 
I left myself with this . But I didn &apos;t discourage . 
I annoyed my father until he finally found a diving school in Buffalo , New York . Right on the other side of the border , where we lived . 
I made my diving certificate in a pool of YMCA in Buffalo , New York , in the middle of winter . 
The ocean . But I got a real ocean only two years later . When we moved to California , 
since the 40 years that have passed , I &apos;ve been underwater for about 3,000 hours . 500 hours of this in submersible boats , 
and I &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea itself is in the flatter oceans . So rich in fascinating life , as we can hardly imagine . 
Nature &apos;s imagination knows no limits , unlike our own miserable human imagination . 
To this day , I find deep awe for what I see on my dives . 
And my love of the ocean continues at the same intensity . As ever . And then , when I was an 
adult , I chose a profession , it was filmmaking . 
That seemed the best way to tell my inner urge to tell stories . It was by my need to create images , 
to unite when I was a kid . I was constantly drawing comic books , and so films were 
the way . Bringing images and stories together , that was what fit . 
Together . Of course , the stories I chose were from the science fiction field , Terminator Aliens . And Abyss : At 
Abyss , I could share my preference for the underwater world and diving with filmmaking . 
So my two passions sort of intertwined . 
Something interesting happened at Abyss to create a narrative problem in this movie . And that was , we had to create a kind of liquid water system , grab . We went back to computer @-@ generated animation CG . 
What came out of this was the first computer @-@ generated soft surface figure . The one that was ever seen in a movie , 
the movie didn &apos;t bring in any money , and in fact it played . It just started to cost its production . But I noticed something fascinating . The audience around the world was hypnotized . The magic that 
was thought to have been , according to Arthur Clarke &apos;s law , advanced technology and magic are no longer to be distinguished . So 
they saw something magical . 
And I found that incredibly exciting . 
And I thought , &quot; Wow , it &apos;s absolutely essential to include that in the film world . &quot; 
So we went to Terminator 2 , my next movie . A lot further along 
with ILM , we created . We created the guy there of liquid metal , who was successful . It was quite a success . How would this effect come about ? 
And it worked . Again , we had created something magical . And the effect in the audience was the same . But we &apos;ve already been recording a little more money with the film from 
these two experiences . And starting with this , we &apos;ve been able to create a whole new world . A whole new world of creativity for filmmakers . 
So I started a company with my good friend Stan . Winston , who was the best make @-@ up and creature designer at that time , called Digital Domain . 
The basic idea of this company was to start jumping over the phase of analog processes with optical printers , etc . , and to start digital productions in a moment . 
We did that . And we also , for a while , 
got a competitive advantage . But in the mid @-@ 1990s , we realized that we were in the Creature and Character Design , for which we actually founded the company . We were 
moving too slowly . I had written this piece &quot; Avatar . &quot; This is the benchmark for visual effects . And computer @-@ generated effects were supposed to shift to new heights with realistic , human expressive characters . These were made using CG , and the main characters were supposed to be all CG . And the world was supposed to be CG . 
But the bar was pretty much pushing back . And the people in my company told me that for the time being , we &apos;re not yet in a position to do that . So that shifted . 
I did that , and I did this other movie about the big ship . This goes 
down to the studio , and I sold that as Romeo and Juliet on a ship . It became a epic @-@ scale love film , a passionate movie , secret 
. But did I actually want to be a real wreck ? Dive down the Titanic 
, so I made the film . 
That &apos;s the truth . The studio knew that . But not me , 
I have it . But convinced by saying , &quot; We dive to the wreck . &quot; We film the real wreck . 
We &apos;ll show it in the opening sequence of the film . 
That &apos;s incredibly important . It &apos;s a good marketing tag . And 
I persuaded them to fund an expedition . 
Sounds crazy . But that &apos;s okay again . It &apos;s because your imagination can create a reality . 
We actually created a reality six months later , in which I found myself in a Russian submersible . Four kilometers below the surface of the North Atlantic , and I looked at the real Titanic through a bullet . This was 
not a movie . No HD . This was real . 
So this really bypassed me . 
And the preparations for this were enormous . We had to build cameras and headlights and everything . 
And I noticed how much these deep @-@ sea dive gears resembled a space mission . 
Well , they were also high @-@ tech . And they needed extensive planning . 
You go into this capsule . Then you float down into this dark , hostile environment where there is no hope of salvation . If you don &apos;t get it back yourself , 
and I thought , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s the same as if I were in a science fiction movie . 
&quot; That &apos;s really cool . I 
was really obsessed with exploring the deep sea . 
Anyway , from the part that has to do with curiosity and science . It was all . It was adventure . It was curiosity . It was imagination . 
And it was an experience that Hollywood could not give me . 
Because , you know , I could imagine a creature for which we could then create a visual effect . But I couldn &apos;t imagine what I would see outside the window . 
In some of the subsequent expeditions , I saw beings in thermal springs . And sometimes things I &apos;d never seen before . Sometimes things that nobody had ever seen before . And for those who had science at the time we saw it . Not a word 
at all , so that really turned me around . And I wanted more , 
and so I made a slightly unusual decision . 
After the success of Titanic , I said , &quot; Okay . &quot; I want my main job as a filmmaker . I &apos;m going to put it on ice in Hollywood for a while , full 
@-@ time researcher . And then we started planning these expeditions . We went to Bismarck . And we went 
and we went and we went and we went and we went and we went and 
we went and we went and we went and we went and we went and we went and we went and we went and we went and we went and we went and we went and we went and we went and we went and we went and we went and we went and we went and we went and we went and we went and we went We went back to the wreck . 
The Titanic . We took small robots that we had built . They were doing a fiberglass cable , 
and our intention was to dive in . And look inside the ship at what had never been done before . 
Nobody had ever explored inside the wreck . You haven &apos;t had the tools to do that . So we developed the technology we needed . 
NA : And I &apos;m sitting on the deck now . The Titanic . In a submersible boat , and I see planks that are quite similar to these boards here . And of those I know the band once played there . 
And I &apos;m flying through the aisles of the ship with 
a little robot vehicle . I &apos;m actually only operating it , but my consciousness is inside the vehicle . 
It felt like I was physically inside the Titanic ship wreck . 
This was the surreal form of a déjà vu . I &apos;ve ever experienced this because before I was bogging around a corner , I always knew . What would appear in the light cone of the vehicle , because I had walked over the movie set for months . When we shot the film , 
the set was an exact copy of the ship &apos;s blueprints . 
So that was a very strange experience . 
She made me realize this telepresence experience that you use robotic avatars like this . And so , your consciousness into the vehicle , into this different shape . It can move the existence . 
It was really incredibly profound . 
And maybe a little bit of a view of it . What might happen in a few decades . If you have cyborg bodies to explore or do other things . In all sorts of post @-@ human future scenarios that I can imagine as a science fiction fan . 
After these expeditions , we started what we had seen down there . Really ? Learning to appreciate . For example , these deep @-@ sea equals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . These are , like , aliens . But here on Earth . 
They live with chemosynthesis . 
They don &apos;t exist in a sunlight @-@ based system . How do we do that 
? And so you see animals right next to a 500 degrees Celsius . Hot water cloud lives . And 
you can &apos;t imagine they can survive there . 
At the same time , I was also very interested in space science . This was again the science fiction influence from my childhood . 
And so I ended up with the people who are interested in space . And those who are involved with NASA and sit on NASA &apos;s expert board and plan real space missions . They go through Russia . Before the mission , the biomedical protocol , and all the drum and drum flying . Then to the International Space Station , and take our 3D camera systems with you . 
That was fascinating . 
But in the end , it was the point that I took space scientists with us into the deep sea . I took them 
and I scaled them into the world . Down there , astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme situations . I took them to the sources so they could look around , take samples and test instruments . And so on . 
We did documentary films , but we actually did science . More specifically , space science , 
so the circle between my existence as a science fiction fan closed . Back then , when I was a kid , and I was a reality . 
And as I went on this journey of discovery , I learned a lot . 
I learned a lot about science . But I also learned a lot about leadership . 
Now , you probably think a director must be able to lead . Being a guide , like a ship captain , or something like that . But 
I didn &apos;t understand much about leadership . Before I started these expeditions , 
because at a certain point , I had to say , &quot; What am I doing ? &quot; Actually , here . 
Why am I doing this ? What &apos;s coming out of this ? These 
stupid movies don &apos;t bring us money . One : We &apos;re 
just playing the production costs . One of fame , no trace . 
Everybody thinks I &apos;m between Titanic and Avatar . I &apos;d run away and I &apos;d kind of haggled the nails on a towel on the beach . 
I &apos;ve got all these movies . These documentary films for a very small audience . 
No fame , no honor . No money . What are you doing ? 
You &apos;re doing it for the sake of the task , for the sake of the challenge . And the ocean is the most challenging environment that exists . You &apos;re doing it for the discovery noise . Because of and because of the strange connection that arises when a small group of people form a team . 
Because we have all done this with just 10 to 12 people . They &apos;ve worked together for years , and sometimes we &apos;ve been at sea for two to three months in a row . 
And in this community , you can see that the most important thing is respect that you have in front of each other . Because you &apos;ve done a job . You can &apos;t explain that to anyone else 
when you go back to land . And you say , &quot; We had to do it . &quot; The fiberglass , the sound attenuation . And the whole around . The whole technique . And the difficulties . The human power . When you work at sea , you just can &apos;t explain that to the other . This is like policemen or soldiers who have gone through something in common . And you know they can never explain it to anyone . 
There &apos;s a connection . So mutual respect comes 
about when I came back to make my next movie , Avatar , I tried to apply the same leadership style , which is that you respect your team . And in return , you deserve the respect , 
and that really changed the dynamics . 
So I stood there again with a small team on unknown terrain . We turned Avatar with a new technology that we didn &apos;t have before . 
Hugely exciting , 
a tremendous challenge . 
And we became a real family for a period of four and a half years . 
And that changed my way of making films . 
Completely , there were people who thought we had really done this ocean estate and transported it to Pandora . For 
me , it was more of a principled way of doing my job . The actual process that changed as a result , 
so what can we conclude from all of this 
, what lessons do we have ? 
We learned . I think , first of all , curiosity is there . 
It &apos;s the most powerful human property . Our 
imagination is a force that can even create a reality . 
And the respect for your team is more important than all laurels . This world comes 
to me , young filmmakers . They say , &quot; Give me a advice like me . &quot; &quot; Can do this ? &quot; 
And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t limit yourself . 
&quot; One : Get this . Other : For you . Don &apos;t do it for you . Even bet not against yourself , but take risks that 
NASA has . So a favorite sentence : Failure is not an alternative . But 
in art and exploration , failure must be an alternative . Because there it guarantees a benefit of trust . 
No important undertaking . Innovation was ever approached without risk . 
You have to be ready . Take risks like 
that . That &apos;s the idea I &apos;d like to give you . Failure is an alternative . Fear . But is not a thank you . 
If I want to bring you one thing closer today , it &apos;s that the whole data we consume is larger than the sum of your parts . And instead of thinking about overloading information , I want you to think about how we are information . So use patterns to create patterns . And we see trends that would otherwise not have been visible . 
So what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical death chart , arranged by age . 
The program I &apos;m using here is a little experiment . 
It &apos;s called Pivot . And what I can do with Pivot is I can filter for a certain cause of death . Let &apos;s say accidents . 
And immediately I see another pattern . 
This is because in the middle , here , people are most active . And they &apos;re most frail over here . 
We can go one step further and arrange . And then the data is new , and we see that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects . But not for everybody . Now , 
if we go further and sort by age , we say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are even the main cause that people should be worried about . 
And anyone who &apos;s going to study can see that this is particularly true for men . 
So you can see that the image of information and data in this way is very much swimming . In a vivid information graph , 
and if we can do this for raw data , why not content ? 
Even what we have here is the cover images . Every single Sports Illustrated that has ever been printed . 
It &apos;s all here . It &apos;s all online . 
You can like to test it after I &apos;ve been talking in your rooms . 
With Pivot , you can dive into a decade . 
You can dive into a given year . 
You can jump directly to a particular issue . 
So if I look here , I see the athletes who are out in this issue . And the sports — 
I &apos;m a Lance Armstrong fan . So I click here . What all the issues that Lance Armstrong mentions to me are what I see . 
Now , if I just want to get a bigger overview , I could think . OK . What if I looked at everything about cycling ? So 
I take a step back . And I expand the perspective . 
Now I see Greg Lemon , 
and so you get an idea of that , that if you search through this kind of information , more targeted , wider , zoom out , zoom out , you don &apos;t look for it or surf . Not easy . Just 
you do something . It &apos;s actually a little different . 
It &apos;s something in between . And we think it changes the way information can be used . 
So I want to take this idea a little bit further . So , with about what &apos;s a little crazy about 
what we &apos;ve done here , we &apos;ve taken every single wikipedia page . And you &apos;ve reduced it to a little summary . 
The summary contains a quick overview . And a symbol of the area from which it comes , 
I &apos;m just going to show the top 500 of the most popular wikipedia pages . 
But even in this narrow view , we can do a lot of things . 
Immediately , we get an idea of the issues . The ones that are most popular on Wikipedia , 
I &apos;m going to vote on the issue of government . 
Now , after I &apos;ve elected government , I realize that the categories of Wikipedia that cover most of it are Time Magazines , people of the year . 
This is really important . Because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single Wikipedia page . 
It &apos;s only to be seen . If you go back a step and look at the whole thing , 
looking at one of these summaries . I can then go into the theme of Time Magazines , &quot; People of the Year . &quot; And everybody goes together . 
See , if I look at all these people , I realize that the majority of them are government officials . Some come from science . Some come from economics , some come from economics . Here &apos;s my boss . And one comes from music . 
And interestingly , Bono is also a TED Prize winner . 
So we can jump now . And take a look at all the TED Prize winners , 
you see , we surf the web . The first time it &apos;s really a web , not just side by side , but much more abstract . 
And so I want to show you something else . What a little surprise . Could 
I just show you the New York Times website ? 
Pivot , this application . I don &apos;t want to call it a browser . It &apos;s really not a browser . But you can look at websites with it . And we bring this zoom technology . Every single website . Like this . 
So I can take a step back . And jump directly to a specific section . 
That &apos;s important because you can only look at websites in this way , all the Internet history , in the same way , in the same way . 
So I can zoom in into my course , in a certain time frame . 
Here &apos;s the state of the whole demonstration . I &apos;ve kept it up to this point , 
and I can sort of look at everything I &apos;ve seen so far . 
I can get back again , and if I go out and look at everything , I can rearrange my course . Maybe after my search past . Here I &apos;ve been looking for nepotistic . Here &apos;s Bing , or Here &apos;s live Labs Pivot . 
And from here I can go into the page . And call it again . 
It &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again . And every time it does the overall picture . Larger than the sum of the data pieces in the world 
right now . Let &apos;s think that data is a curse . 
We talk about the curse of the abundance of information . 
We talk about drowning in information . 
What if we could turn this situation around ? And the Internet upside down . So instead of always going from one to the other , we &apos;re going to put it on the head . We &apos;re going to start from a lot of things . A lot of things . We can go to . And by doing that , we can see patterns that would otherwise have been hidden . 
If we can do this , then this data trap will be . Maybe a new source of meaningful information . 
And instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge from it . 
And if we know , then maybe we can even learn wisdom from it . 
So I stop . Thank you . 
Everybody talks about happiness today . 
I have some people counting the number of books . Let those with happiness published in the title over the last five years . And they stopped after about 40 . And there were many more . 
There &apos;s a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers . 
There &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching . 
Everybody would like to make people happier . 
But despite all this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps . They make it almost impossible , so to speak . Sure . Thinking about happiness . 
And my talk . Today , it &apos;s mostly these cognitive traps that will act . 
That &apos;s true for laymen . Thinking about their own happiness . And it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness because it turns out we &apos;re just as confused . Like everybody else , 
the first of these traps is to admit complexity . 
It turns out that the word happiness is simply no longer a useful word , because we have too many different things to apply . 
I think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could limit it to . But by and large , this is something that we need to give up . And we will need to take the complicated view . What well @-@ being is 
the second case . Is it a confusion of experience ? And memory , basically , is between happiness . In his life , and being happy about his life , or happy . With his life , 
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both thrown together . In the notion of happiness , 
and the third is the concentration illusion . And that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about one thing . Well @-@ being affects without distorting its meaning . 
I mean , this is a real cognitive trap . 
There &apos;s just no way . It &apos;s getting right . 
Now I &apos;d like to start with an example from someone who had a question and answer session . After one of my lectures , which told a story , he was unclear , he said he &apos;d heard a symphony . And it was absolutely magnificent . ( Music ) And at the very end of the recording , there was a terrible , creeping sound . 
And then he added , &quot; Really , quite emotionally . That &apos;s ruined the whole experience . 
But it didn &apos;t . 
&quot; What it ruined was the memories of the experience . 
It had the experience . 
It had 20 minutes . It had wonderful music . 
It didn &apos;t count because it had remained with a memory . The memory was ruined . And the memory was everything . What it had got to keep , 
what it really tells us is that we think about ourselves and about other people . In the sense of two kinds of self , 
there &apos;s a living self . That lives in the present , and that the present knows is capable of the past . Reexperience it . But basically , only the present has 
it . It &apos;s the living self . That the doctor is acclaimed . You know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Is it hurting now ? &quot; When I touch you here , 
and then there &apos;s a memory self . And the memory self is that which is widening . And keeps the story of our lives upright . And it &apos;s the one that the doctor addresses by asking the question , &quot; How did you feel lately 
or how was your journey to Albania or something like that ? 
&quot; These are two very different entities . The living self and the remembering self . And confusing the two is part of the uniformity of the term happiness . 
Now , the remembering self is a storyteller . 
And that really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memories . It starts immediately . 
We &apos;re not just telling stories . When we make ourselves tell stories , 
our memory tells us stories . That means that what we can keep from our experiences is a story . 
And let &apos;s start with an example . 
There &apos;s an old study . 
These are real patients . They undergo a painful procedure . 
I &apos;m not going to go into detail . It &apos;s no longer painful today . But it was painful . When this study was done in the 1990s , 
they were asked to report every 60 seconds about their pain . And 
here are two patients . These are their records . 
And they &apos;re asked , &quot; Who of both suffered more ? &quot; 
And that &apos;s a very simple question . 
Patient B has clearly suffered more . His intestinal reflection was longer . And every minute of pain , the patient A had patient B and more . 
But now there &apos;s another question . How much did these patients think they suffered , 
and here &apos;s a surprise ? And 
the surprise is that patient A has had a much worse memory of intestinal reflection . When patient B had 
the stories of intestinal reflections , different , and because a very critical part of the story is . How it ends , 
and none of these stories is very edifical . Or great . But one of them is clear . But one of them is significantly worse than the other . 
And the one that is worse was where the pain was at its peak at the very end . It &apos;s a bad story . 
How do we know that ? 
Because we asked these people about their spinal reflections . And much later . How bad was the whole thing ? Overall , 
and it was much worse for A than for B in memory . 
Well , this is a direct conflict between the living self . And the remembering self , 
from the perspective of the living self , B clearly had a worse time . 
Now , what you could do with patient A , and we actually did clinical experiments . And it was done . And it works . You could actually extend the intestinal reflection of patient A by just leaving the tube inside without too much shaking on it . 
That will cause the patient to suffer , but only a little bit less than before . 
And if you do that for a few minutes , you &apos;ve made the living person worse off even by patient A . And you &apos;ve made the memory self of patient A much better off . Because now you have patient A better story about your experience . 
What does a story look like ? 
And that &apos;s true of the stories that memory gives us . And it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent . 
What makes a story look like is upheavals , significant moments and ends . 
Ends are very , very important . And in this case , the end dominated . 
Now , the living self is constantly living its life . 
It has moments of experience one after the other . 
And you ask , what happens to these moments ? 
And the answer is really simple . They &apos;re lost forever . 
I mean , most moments of our lives , and I &apos;ve calculated that . You know , the psychological presence is considered for about three seconds . What does it mean ? Do you know that there are about 600 million of them in a life ? In a month , there are about 600,000 , most of them left behind . There &apos;s no trace . 
Most of them are completely ignored . They &apos;re somehow getting 
the impression from the memory self , and yet they should count that what happens during these moments of experience . Our life is 
it &apos;s the limited resource we consume . While we &apos;re in this world 
and how we consume it . It would seem important . But that &apos;s not the story . It keeps the memory self for us . 
So we have the memory self . And the living self . And they &apos;re really quite different . 
The biggest difference between them is the way that time is handled 
from the perspective of the living . Even if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first . Then the two @-@ week holiday is twice as good as the one @-@ week holiday . 
That &apos;s how it works . It &apos;s not at all for the memory . Even 
for the memory self , a two @-@ week holiday is . Hardly better than the one @-@ week holiday , because there are no new memories added . 
You haven &apos;t changed the story . 
And that &apos;s how time is . Actually , the critical variable that distinguishes a memory self from a living self has time . Very little influence on that story . 
Now , the memory self makes more than remembering . And telling stories . 
It &apos;s actually the one . It makes decisions , because if you have a patient who , let &apos;s say , had two intestinal reflections with two different surgeons . And decides which one to choose . If you want to , then the one who chooses is the one who has the memory that &apos;s less bad . And that &apos;s the surgeon who will be selected . 
The living self has no voice in that choice . 
We actually don &apos;t choose between experiences . We choose between memories of experiences 
and even experiences . When we think about the future , we think about our future . Normally not as experiences . 
We think about our future . As anticipated memories , 
and basically you can look at that . You know , as a tyranny of the memory self . And you can remember the memory self . Think as one that kind of drags the living self through experiences that the living self doesn &apos;t need . 
I have the impression that when we go on vacation , that &apos;s very often the case , that &apos;s what it means . We go on vacation as far as possible in the service of the memory . Even -- 
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify . I think so . 
I mean , how much food . We &apos;re fed by our memories . 
That &apos;s one of the explanations given for the dominance of the memory self . 
And when I think about that , I think about a vacation we spent a few years ago in Antarctica . It was clearly the best vacation I &apos;d ever had . And I think about it relatively often , relative to how often I think about other vacations , 
and I probably have my memories of it . This three @-@ week journey . I would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years . 
Drilled . Now , if I &apos;d ever opened the folder with the 600 images in it , I would have spent another hour . 
Now , that &apos;s three weeks . And that &apos;s at most one and a half hours . 
There seems to be disagreement . 
Now , I like to be a little extreme . You know , in it , how little appetite ? I have to feed memories . But even if you do more of that , there &apos;s a real question . Why do we give memories ? So much weight . In the scourge to weight . That we give experiences . 
So I want you to think about a thought experiment . 
Imagine your next vacation . You know , at the end of your vacation , all your pictures are destroyed . And you get an amnesty drug . So you will remember nothing . 
Now , you would choose the same vacation . And if you chose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two kinds of self . And you have to think about how you decide this conflict . And that &apos;s really not obvious at all . Because if you think about time , you get an answer . And if you think about memories , you could get a different answer . 
Why ? We choose holidays . The one we choose is a problem . That confronts us with a choice between the two kinds of self . 
Now , the two kinds of self throw two terms of happiness . 
There are actually two concepts of happiness . We can apply one per se . 
So you can ask , how happy is it ? The living self . 
And then you would ask , how happy are the moments in the life of the living person ? Even , 
and you &apos;re all lucky for moments . Is it a pretty complicated one ? Process . 
What are the emotions ? Which can be measured ? 
And by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea . From happiness of the living self over time . 
If you ask about happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a very different thing . 
It &apos;s not about that . How happy a person lives . 
It &apos;s about how satisfied or happy . The person is when that person thinks about his life . 
Very different terms . 
Anyone who doesn &apos;t distinguish these terms will mask the exploration of happiness . And I &apos;m a lot of researchers about well @-@ being . Those who have long masked the exploration of happiness in exactly this way , 
the distinction between the happiness of the living self . And the happiness of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years . And now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separately , 
the Gallup Organization has a global survey , where more than half a million people have been asked questions . What do you know about your life ? Think about your experiences . And there have been other efforts in the direction . 
So in recent years , we &apos;ve started to think about the happiness of the two kinds of self . 
And the main lesson we &apos;ve learned , I think , is that they &apos;re really different . 
You can know how satisfied someone is with his life . And that really doesn &apos;t teach you much . How happy he is . Life lives . And vice versa . 
Just to give you an idea of correlation . Correlation is about five . 
What that means is that if you met someone , and you would tell them , &quot; Oh , his father is a two @-@ meter man . &quot; How much would you know about his height ? 
Well , you would know about his size . But there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty . 
You have so much uncertainty . 
When I tell you that someone has his life as eight on a scale of 10 . Do you have a lot of uncertainty about that ? How happy he is with his survivor ? So 
even the correlation is low . 
We know something about what determines happiness itself . 
We know money is very important . Goals are very important . 
We know happiness is basically about being satisfied with people we like to spend time . With people we like , 
there &apos;s other pleasure . But that &apos;s dominant . 
So if you maximize happiness of the two kinds of self , you end up doing very different things . 
The conclusion from what I said here is that we really don &apos;t want happiness . As a substitute for well @-@ being , 
it &apos;s a completely different term . 
Now , very briefly . Another reason why we can &apos;t think clearly about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things . When we think about life , and when we actually live , 
so when you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California , they won &apos;t get the right answer . 
When you ask that question , you think that people in California need to be happier . When you say , &quot; We live in Ohio , &quot; 
and what happens is when you think about life in California , you think about the difference between California and other places . And that difference is , say , climate . 
Well , it turns out climate doesn &apos;t matter very much to the living self . And it &apos;s not even very important to the thoughtful . Even that decides how happy people are . 
Now , because the thoughtful self is responsible , you can end up with some people . At the end , they can move to California , 
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track . What happens to people ? They move to California hoping to get happier . 
Well , their living self won &apos;t get happier . 
We know that . 
But one thing will happen . They &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier . Because when they think about it , they &apos;ll be reminded of how terrible . The weather in Ohio was , and they &apos;ll feel that they made the right decision . 
It &apos;s very difficult to think clearly about well @-@ being . And I hope I &apos;ve given you an idea of how difficult it is . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question for you . 
Thank you very much . 
Well , when we telephoned a few weeks ago , you told me that there was a pretty interesting result . This came from this Gallup survey , 
is that something you &apos;re participating in ? Because you can leave a few minutes now . 
Daniel Kahneman : Sure . 
I think the most interesting result . The one we found in the Gallup survey is a number that we had absolutely not expected to find . 
We found that in terms of happiness for the survivor himself . 
When we looked at how feelings vary with income , 
and it turns out that under an income of 60,000 dollars a year for Americans . And this is a very big sample of Americans . About 600,000 . But it &apos;s a big representative sample . Under an income of 600,000 dollars a year . 
About 60,000 . 
DK : 60,000 , 
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy . And they &apos;re getting increasingly unhappy . The poorer they get about 
it . We get an absolutely flat line . 
I mean , I rarely saw such flat lines . 
What happens is that money doesn &apos;t get you experience happiness . But that lack of money certainly brings you misery . And we can measure this misery very , very clearly . 
In the sense of the other self , the memory self , you get a different story . 
The more money you make , the more satisfied you are . 
That &apos;s not true of emotions . 
CA : But Danny , throughout the American endeavor , it &apos;s about life . Freedom , the aspiration for happiness . 
If people were to take this finding seriously , I think it seems . It &apos;s all about upsetting . Everything we believe , for example , in tax policy and so on . 
Is there a chance that politicians , that the country would generally take a finding like the seriousness ? And based on that , politics would do 
DK , you know , I think there &apos;s recognition for the role of gambling research in politics . 
Recognition will be slow . In the United States , no question . But in the United Kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now . And in other countries , it &apos;s happening right now . 
People are recognizing that they should think about happiness . When they think about politics , 
it &apos;s going to take a while . And people will discuss whether they want to explore experience happiness . Or whether they want to explore life assessment . So we need this discussion . Very soon , 
how to increase happiness . It &apos;s very different . Depending on how you think . And whether you think about the memory self , or whether you think about the living self . 
That &apos;s going to affect politics . I think so . In the years ahead , 
in the United States , you &apos;re going to be tightening on the experience happiness of the population . 
That , I think , will be part of national statistics in the next one or two decades . 
CA : Well , it seems to me that this topic is going to , or should , be at least the most interesting political debate to follow . Over the next few years , 
thank you very much . For the invention of behavioral economics . 
Thank you . Danny Kahneman : Today 
I &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate . 
And that &apos;s surprising . Maybe something because my full @-@ time work at the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds , about the things we invent . And we need to deliver to the poorest two billion to make a better life possible . 
But energy and climate are extremely important . In fact , for these people , they are even more important than for everyone . For others on the planet , 
climate degradation means that their seeds will not grow for many years . It means we &apos;re raining too much or too little . Things will change that way . How your fragile environment cannot endure . 
That leads to starvation . It leads to insecurity . It leads to unrest . 
So climate change will become terrible for you . And it &apos;s 
also the energy price for you . Very important . 
The fact is , if you could just reduce the price of one thing , to reduce poverty , energy would be by far the most effective . 
Now , the energy price has fallen over time . 
In fact , the progress society is based on energy advances , which have 
driven coal evolution , the Industrial Revolution . And even in the 20th century , there was a rapid fall in the electricity price , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , air conditioning . We can make modern materials . And so many things we do . 
We are . So in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world . 
But if we reduce the price , we let the price down by half , we hit . We hit a new barrier , and this barrier is related to CO2 , 
CO2 warms the planet . And the equation for CO2 is actually pretty clear . 
They sum up the CO2 emitted , which leads to temperature increase . And this temperature increase has some very negative consequences . Effects on the weather . And maybe worse , the indirect consequence is that natural ecosystems cannot adapt to such rapid changes . And so whole systems collapse , 
now the exact link between a CO2 increase and the resulting temperature change . And where the further consequences lie , there are some ambiguities . But not very many . 
And there &apos;s certainly uncertainty about how bad these consequences are . But they &apos;re going to be extremely bad . 
I &apos;ve asked the top scientists several times , &quot; Do we really have to get down to near zero ? 
&quot; &quot; Not enough . &quot; Half or a quarter . 
&quot; The answer is , &quot; Until we get near zero . &quot; &quot; The temperature will continue to rise . 
&quot; So it &apos;s a big challenge . 
It &apos;s quite different from saying . We have a 3.5 @-@ meter truck that &apos;s going to have to come under a three @-@ meter bridge . You can squeeze that down below . This 
has to be down to zero . 
Well , we run into zero every year . A lot of carbon dioxide out of over 26 billion tons . 
Every American , about 20 tons . People from poor countries , less than one on average , 
it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet . 
And somehow we have to make changes . We have to reduce that to zero . 
It &apos;s been constantly increasing . 
Only different economic changes have affected it at all . And we have to go from rapid growth to reduction . And to a reduction to zero . 
This equation has four factors . A little multiplication . You have this thing on the left , CO2 . You want to get it to zero . And that will depend on the number of people , on the services that every human being uses on average . The average energy for every service . And the CO2 . The CO2 emitted per unit of energy , 
so let &apos;s look at each factor individually . And let &apos;s think about how we get that to zero . 
Probably one of these numbers has to come very close to zero . 
Now , this is basic algebra . But let &apos;s go . First of 
all , we have the population . 
Today , 6.8 billion people live 
, and it &apos;s rising to 9 billion . 
It &apos;s moving to 9 billion . If we succeed very successfully with new vaccines , healthcare and reproductive medicine , we could probably reduce that by 10 to 15 percent . But right now , we &apos;re seeing a 1.3 percent rise , and 
the second factor is the services we use . 
That &apos;s all . The food we eat , clothing , television , heating -- 
these are very good things . And poverty reduction means that these services are accessible to almost everyone on the planet . 
It &apos;s great that this number is rising 
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to make cuts . And use less , but on average , this number is going to increase every year . And so overall , more than double the number of services that are provided per person . 
Here we see a very basic service : Is there light at home ? So you can read the homework , 
and these students have . It &apos;s not . So they go out . And they read . They do their homework . Under the street light . 
Now , effectiveness , the E : The energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news . 
We have something that doesn &apos;t go up . 
Because of different successes in the lighting sector , because of other types of cars , because of new methods . In the building of houses , there are many services , their energy use . They can drastically reduce . They can be drastically reduced . 
103.00 @ 05. 50 000 GT 00 05 53 000 Some services Can be reduced by 90 % Some 
individual services Can be reduced by 90 % Other services , such as fertilisers production ( 105,00 - 05.56,000 GT - 00.05.58.000 ) or air transport or air transport , have the room for improvement , much smaller . 
Overall , if we are optimistic , we may get a 3 factor reduction or maybe even a 6 factor reduction . But now , 
with the first three factors , we &apos;re from 26 billion to maybe the very best 13 billion tons . And that &apos;s just not enough . 
So let &apos;s look at the fourth factor . And this will be a key factor . That &apos;s the amount of CO2 emitted per unit of energy . 
The question is , can you get that to zero ? 
If you burn coal ? No , 
if you burn natural gas ? No , 
almost every method of making electricity . Today , CO2 emits , except renewable energy . And nuclear energy , 
so what we need to do at a global level , is create a new system . 
We need energy cycles . 
Now , if I use the term &quot; wonder , &quot; I don &apos;t mean . The impossible , 
the microprocessor , is a miracle . The PC is a miracle . 
The Internet and its services are a miracle . 
People here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles . 
Normally , there &apos;s no deadline for you to need a miracle by a certain date . 
Normally , you &apos;re just standing next to it . And some don &apos;t come to others . 
But in this case , we have to give full gas . And a miracle in a very short time . 
Well , I wondered , how can I really get this over ? 
Is there a natural illustration ? A demonstration that sparks the idea of people here . 
I remembered last year when I brought mosquitos . And somehow people liked this , 
the idea became really tangible to them . You know , there are people who live with mosquitos 
, for energy fell . I got this one . 
I decided that releasing fireflies , my contribution to the environment this year , would be here . 
So here are some natural fireflies . 
I &apos;ve been assured they &apos;re not biting , actually . They &apos;re not even going to leave the glass . 
Well , there are all kinds of game solutions like this . But they &apos;re not all doing much . 
We need solutions . Either one or more that have unimaginable scaling and unimaginable reliability . And although there are many directions where people are looking for it . I really see only five that can make these big demands . 
I &apos;ve omitted tides , geothermal fusion and biofuels . 
These may make a moderate contribution , and if they do better than I expect , that would be great . But my key message here is that we need to work on all those five . And we can &apos;t give up on them because they intimidate us . Because everybody has significant problems . 
Let &apos;s first look at them . Burning fossil fuels . Burning either coal or natural gas , 
which you have to do there . Maybe it just seems . But that &apos;s not it . You have to have all that CO2 . That comes from the chimney after it &apos;s burned , captured , under pressure . Liquid and then store somewhere . And hope it stays there . 
There are some pilot projects that can do that at a 60 / 80 level . But getting it to 100 will be very difficult . And reaching an agreement on storing CO2 is a big challenge . But the biggest problem here is storing time . 
Who will make sure ? 
Who can guarantee something ? What literally is many billion times bigger ? As any kind of waste you get to imagine about nuclear and other things . 
That &apos;s a lot of volume . 
So this is a hard nut . 
Next , nuclear energy 
, which also has three major problems . The cost , especially in highly regulated countries , is high . The question of security , that you really feel that nothing can go wrong . Despite human cooperation , that the fuel is not used for weapons . 
And what do you do ? Then with the waste . 
Because although it &apos;s not very big , there are a lot of concerns . 
People have to feel good about it . 
184,00 10 20 000 GT 00 10 25 000 . So three very difficult problems . So maybe the solutions are three very difficult problems . They may be solvable , and they should work on them . So I summarized 
the last three of the five . They &apos;re renewable energy , 
as they &apos;re often called . 
And they also have , although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel . They have some disadvantages . 
One is that the energy density that these technologies generate is dramatically lower . When the power plants are 
, these are low @-@ energy . You talk about many square kilometers more space than a normal power plant , and they &apos;re 
also subject to . These sources , interruptions , 
the sun doesn &apos;t shine all day long . Nor does it shine every day . And the wind doesn &apos;t blow all the time either . 
So , if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , you have to have a way to do that , even in times . If it &apos;s not available , 
so there are big price challenges here . There are challenges in transmission . For example , if we say that the energy source is outside the country , it doesn &apos;t just need technology . It also needs to deal with the risk that the energy comes from where it 
comes from , and there is . The storage problem . 
And to show the dimension , I &apos;ve looked at all kinds of batteries that are produced . The ones for cars , computers , mobile phones , flashlights for everything , and I &apos;ve got compared with the amount of electronic energy that the world uses . I found that all the batteries that we &apos;re now producing store less than 10 minutes of total energy . 
So , could we need a big breakthrough here ? Something that will be 100 percent better by one factor . When the approaches at the moment — 
that &apos;s not impossible . But it &apos;s not that easy . 
That happens when you try to get these interrupted sources to , say , 20 @-@ 30 percent of consumption . 
If you want to rely on that 100 percent , you need an incredible wonder battery . 
Now , where are we going to go ? What &apos;s the right approach ? 
A Manhattan project . How do we get to the finish ? 
What we need is a lot of companies . They &apos;re working on it . Hundreds . 
In each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people . 
For many , they &apos;ll say , &quot; They &apos;re crazy . &quot; That &apos;s good . 
I think there are many in the TED group who are already engaged there . 
Bill Gross has several companies , including one called Esolar , which has great solar thermal technologies . 
Vinod Khosla is investing in dozens of companies doing great things . And interesting opportunities , and I &apos;m trying to support that . 
Nathan Myhrvold and I are funding a company that maybe surprisingly has a nuclear approach . 
There are some innovations in the nuclear sector : Modular , liquid , 
development in this industry . So it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts have stopped some time ago . 
The Terrapower concept means that instead of a part of the uranium , one percent , you have the U235 . We decided to burn the 99 . The U238 
is a pretty crazy idea . But 
in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time . But you could never simulate it sensibly . Whether it would work . But since there are modern supercomputers , you can simulate it . And you can see that yes , with the right approach to matter . It looks like it works , 
and because you burn those 99 , it &apos;s like this . The cost profile is much better . In fact , 
you burn the garbage , and you can even burn the garbage from today &apos;s reactors . 
You use it as a drive , rather than breaking your head over it , you just burn it . A great thing . 
The uranium is being used gradually . A little bit like a candle . 
You can see that it &apos;s a kind of column . It &apos;s often called a wandering wave reactor , 
which really solves it . The fuel problem . 
Here &apos;s a picture of a place . In Kentucky , 
this is the waste . The 99 . You have the part that &apos;s burned today . You have taken it out . So it &apos;s called &quot; Abused . 
&quot; Uranium : That shoots . The U.S. : For hundreds of years . 
And if you filter ocean water cheaply and easily , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet &apos;s 
life . You know , there are many challenges there . But it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts . They need to move forward . 
Let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success 
. What should our testimony look like ? 
Well , we go to the finish line . We need to achieve that , and then talk . We talk about the intermediate step 
, many talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 . 
It &apos;s really , really important that we get there . 
The remaining 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still some agriculture . Hopefully forest threats and cement will . Until then , clean . 
So to achieve this 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like China , has to . Completely transform their generation of electricity . 
The other note says whether we &apos;re using zero emissions technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries . And we &apos;re on the way to getting it to the 
rest . That &apos;s super important . 
That &apos;s going to be a key element of this product . 
If we go back from there , what should that 2020 be ? 
It should contain the two elements again . 
We should use the effectiveness measures to get reduction going . The less we emit , the less CO2 we emit . And so will the temperature . 
But actually , this note is for the things we do , which do not completely lead to the big reductions . Just equal or even slightly less important . Like the others , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs . 
We have to track these breakthroughs with full gas . And we can measure that . In company numbers , in pilot projects and regulatory changes , 
there are many great books on this subject . 
The Al Gore book . We have the choice . And David McKay &apos;s Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air . They 
really go through it . And they create a framework where this can be widely discussed . Because we need support from all sides for this . 
There are some things that need to come together . 
That &apos;s a wish . 
A very concrete wish that we invent this technology . 
If you just want to allow me to do that for the next 50 years . I could choose the president , a vaccine , and that &apos;s what I love . I , or ? I could choose that wish . That is : Halved energy price . Without CO2 , it &apos;s invented . That &apos;s what I would like to 
see . This one has the greatest impact . 
If we don &apos;t get that wish , the gap between long @-@ term and short @-@ term thinking will be . People will be terrible between the United States and China , between poor and rich countries . And almost all of them will live on these two billion , and they will be much worse . 
So what do we have to do ? 
What action do I appeal for ? 
We have to work for more research funding . 
When countries meet in places like Koppenhagen , they should not just talk about CO2 . 
They should discuss this innovation strategy . And they would be shocked by the ridiculously low money spent on these innovative approaches . 
We need market incentives , CO2 , taxes , cap &amp; amp ; trade , something that sends a price signal . 
We need to spread the news . 
We need to have dialogue more rational and complete . And the things that the government is doing . 
It &apos;s an important wish . But I think we can fulfill it . 
Thank you . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . Thank you . 
Thank you . Just to get Terrapower a little better . First of all , you can give us an idea of the scale of this investment . 
Bill Gates : To do the simulation on a supercomputer , get all the big scientists . What we &apos;ve done is we need just a few 10 million . And even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a Russian reactor to make sure it works properly . Is it just in the 100 million ? The 
difficult step is building the first reactor . Find another billion , the regulations and the place that actually builds the first of them . 
Once the first is finished , when it &apos;s going as promised , then it &apos;s all very clear . Because the economic viability , the energy density , is as different as we are with nuclear energy . 
You know about it , to understand it correctly . That means deep . Building into the ground , almost like a vertical . Pillar of nuclear fuel , this consumed uranium , and then the process starts at the top . And it continues to work down . 
BG : Exactly . Today , you have to refill the reactor . So there are lots of people and lots of controls that go wrong . Can this thing where you open it ? And bring things in or out ? That &apos;s not good . 
But if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years . Think of a column that you bury . Without all the complexities . 
And it sits there . And it burns for 60 years . And then it &apos;s done . 
CA : A nuclear reactor . The self provides a solution to the garbage . 
BG : Yeah . Now what happens to the garbage ? You can sit there . There &apos;s much less garbage with this method . Then you take it and put it in the next reactor . And you burn it further . 
And we start by taking the garbage . It already exists , which is in these cooling basins or dry tanks , at the reactors . That &apos;s our starting fuel . 
So what was a problem for these reactors ? What we do in our fill fills , and that &apos;s dramatically reducing the garbage volume . During this process , 
about , but as you talk to different people around the world about these possibilities . 
Where is the biggest ? Interest , like that . What really to do ? 
BG : Well , we haven &apos;t yet set ourselves in a place . And there &apos;s a lot of interesting disclosure rules for everything . The nuclear in the name is there . There &apos;s a lot of interest . And the people of the company were in Russia , India . China , I was here . And I met the energy minister . And I talked about how this fits into the energy agenda . 
I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the French . And Japanese have made something in the direction . 
This is a variant . One thing that has been done is 
an important step forward . But it &apos;s like a fast reactor . And some countries have built these . So anyone who has implemented a fast reactor is a candidate for our first one . 
CA : In your imagination , timeframe and probability . Really to create this . 
BG : Well , we need one of these scalable , power generating things that is very cheap . We &apos;ve got 20 years to invent , and then 20 years to deploy . 
This is kind of the deadline . The environmental models that we &apos;ve got to meet , which we &apos;ve got to meet . 
And you know , Terrapower . If everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , could it ? Keep it easy , 
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds that are the same . If their approaches work , the promotion for their pilots works . Can offer that , 
and it would be best if several could do it . Because then you could use a mix . In any case , 
we need a solution . 
CA : So , with regard to the big , possible breakthroughs , this is the biggest one . You know that . 
BG : An energy break . Is that the most important thing ? 
It would have been without the environmental challenge . But it makes it even more important . 
In the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies . 
You know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as they do . But there &apos;s the modular method . That &apos;s a different approach . 
There &apos;s a liquid reactor type that seems a little difficult . But maybe they say that about us . 
And so there are different ones . But the nice thing about this is that a uranium molecule has a million times as much energy as saying . We , a carbon molecule , and so if you can deal with the problems , and these are mainly the radiation of the footprint . And the cost is the potential . So the impact on the country and other things , almost in a league of its own . 
CA : If that doesn &apos;t work , what 
do we have to do is take emergency measures to try and keep the Earth temperature stable ? 
BG : When you get into this situation , it &apos;s as if you ate too much . And you &apos;re about to have a heart attack , and what do you do ? Well , you might need a heart surgery or something like that . 
There &apos;s a research that &apos;s called geoengineering . It &apos;s about different techniques to delay warming . So that we could get 20 or 30 years longer to get together . 
That &apos;s just an insurance method . 
You hope we don &apos;t need that . 
Some people say you shouldn &apos;t work on insurance at all because maybe you &apos;re lazy , so you eat , because you know that heart surgery can save you . 
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart . If you look at the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you have that at your disposal . If things get faster or this innovation takes longer than we expect . 
CA : Climate skeptics , do you have one or two sentences for those around ? Maybe convince them . 
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps . 
Those who make scientific arguments are very little , 
say . They have negative effects that have to do with the clouds . They move things . 
There are very , very few things they can even say . Of which there is a chance in a million . 
The main problem here is very much like AIDS . 
You make the mistake . Now , and you pay for it much later . 
And so the idea now is , if you have all kinds of urgent problems . Investing in something that you only have later on . And then the investment is not so clear . In fact , the IPCC Report is not necessarily . The worst scenario . And there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC . And they say , &quot; Okay , this is not a big drama . The 
fact is that this uncertainty should worry us . &quot; But 
my dream here is that if you can make it economically and at the same time eliminate CO2 . Then the skeptics also say , &quot; Okay . &quot; I &apos;m not interested in it emitting CO2 . I almost wish it did . But I &apos;m probably going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . CA 
: And that would be your answer to the Björn Lomborg argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve the CO2 problem , you can do it . All the other goals , including poverty reduction , malaria control and so on , are suffering from this , and it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources . Money . Investing for this . While there are better things we can do . 
BG : Well , the actual spending on research , let &apos;s say , the U.S. should be 10 billion a year . Expenditure more than you do today . That &apos;s not so dramatic . 
It &apos;s not something that other things should 
suffer from . You get too much money . And here , reasonable people can disagree . If you have something that &apos;s not economic and you try to finance it . For me , most waste is happening here . 
Unless you &apos;re very short . Before a breakthrough in cost , you only fund the learning curve . I think we should try more things that have the potential . We should try to be much cheaper . 
If the swab you get is a very high energy price . Then only the rich can keep up . 
I mean , each of us here could spend five times as much on our energy . Without changing our lifestyle , for 
the bottom two billion . 
But is it a disaster ? 
And even Lomborg thinks , &quot; To make his new mesh , why is research not being discussed anymore ? &quot; 
He &apos;s still being associated with the skeptic camp because of his earlier stories . But he understood that this is a very lonely group . And so he &apos;s now bringing the research argument , 
and that &apos;s a thought that I think is appropriate . 
Research , it &apos;s just crazy . How little support is being given to this ? CA 
: Bill . I think I speak for almost all people . Here , when I say , &quot; I really hope that your wish will come true . &quot; Thank you very much . 
BG : Thank you . 
I &apos;d like to tell you something . What I did a few months ago when I wrote an article for Italian Wired . 
Is it me who wrote ? Is it always my synonymous dictionary that &apos;s ready for use ? But I was working with the text . It &apos;s done . And I noticed that I &apos;ve never looked at my life . What the word &quot; obstructs &quot; really means . I &apos;m going to 
read you the entry &quot; Obstacles 
&quot; . ( Adjective : Curved ) Helpless , useless , destroyed Deceased , mutilated Wounded , prepared , paralyzed Separated Deposited Extincted , weakened @ impotent @ castriert @ paralyzed @ geandicapt. @ senil @ age @-@ weak withdrawn from circulation @ improved , done @ broken @ borrowed @ counted ( see also injured ) @ useless And @ weak @ 
antonyme , healthy @ strong , powerful 
I read this list out loud to a friend . And I had to laugh first . It worked so ridiculous . But I just got ready and couldn &apos;t speak any more . And I had to stop reading . And first of all , collect me after this invincible flood of words . 
And the emotional shock that comes with it . Of course , this was a fractured old synonym dictionary . I just thought that the issue has to be pretty old . But 
in fact , it was an issue in the early &apos; 80s . When I just started primary school , and that started building my self @-@ image outside of my family environment . And also to shape it in terms of other children and around me around 
the world . And thank God , I didn &apos;t use a synonymous dictionary at the time . 
I would take this entry seriously . Take it as if I were born into a world that someone like me would perceive as a person whose lives were not in any way positive . But can I now , for the opportunities and adventures I &apos;ve experienced ? So 
I immediately called the 2009 online edition . And I expected to find a more appealing contribution here . 
Here &apos;s the updated version . This entry , 
unfortunately , is not much better . 
In particular , the last two words shake me under Near Antonym . All right and healthy . But 
it &apos;s not just about words . 
It &apos;s about what we think about people . We describe them with these words . 
It &apos;s about the values that are in those words . And how we construct those values . 
Our language influences our thinking and how we influence the world and the people around us . 
Many ancient societies , including those of the Greeks and the Romans , really believed that the debate of a curse has a great force , because what you say loud can manifest itself . 
So what do we want ? Actually , a disabled person or a powerful person manifests himself . Already 
calling a person careless as a child could be enough . Restricting them and putting ideas over them 
wouldn &apos;t be more beautiful to open doors to them . A 
person . He who opened doors to me was my pediatrician . At the A.I. DuPont Institute in Wilmington , Delaware . 
His name is Dr. Pizzutillo , an Italo @-@ American whose name , you can imagine , is : Most Americans couldn &apos;t speak correctly , so he was always called Dr. P. 
And Dr. P. always wore very colorful flies . And he was for working with kids . Simply made like this . 
I found the time I spent in this hospital . Simply great except for my physiotherapy . 
I had to repeat individual exercises seemingly infinitely . With these thick elastic bands in different colors . You know that around . Building my leg muscles , and I hated these bands more . Throughout everything , I hated them . I cursed them . I hated them . 
And imagine I even had a child of five with Dr. P. And so this is how I try to stop these exercises . Natural , without success . 
And one day he watched me doing one of my exercises . These exercises were just tiring . And mercilessly , and he said to me , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you &apos;re such a strong guy . Powerful and young girl , you &apos;re going to tear one of these tapes one day . 
And if you can do it , I &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot; 
That was , of course , just a simple trick by Dr. P. to do the exercises . I didn &apos;t want to do that with the prospect that richest five @-@ year @-@ old girls would be in the hospital on the second floor . But he actually got me to do that . See my daily exercise horror with new eyes . So it became a new and promising experience . 
And I wonder today how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl . Shaped my self @-@ image , and I could imagine myself as one of nature &apos;s strong , powerful and atlethic people . 
This is just one example of many , like adults . In power positions that can stimulate a child &apos;s 
imagination , but as the examples from the synonymous dictionaries already cited prove , our language doesn &apos;t give us any room to imagine something . What we all want would allow each and every one of us to see themselves as powerful people . 
Our language lags behind social change . In many cases , triggered by technological change , from a medical point of 
view , can . Of course , my legs , laser surgery for visually impaired , knee joints made of titanium and artificial hip joints . For aging bodies that allow people to really use all their possibilities . And beyond the limits that their natural destiny has placed on them , they can develop . Not to speak at all . Social networking platforms : People allow themselves to have their own identity , define themselves in their own way . And thus , 
they orient themselves globally to groups that they choose . 
So maybe this technological change makes it clearer . Because ever before , there has always been a different truth , which is that every human being has something very special and very powerful to give to society . And that human ability to adapt . Our greatest plus is 
human ability to adapt . This is an interesting story . Because people keep asking me to tell me how to deal with adversity , and I &apos;ll confess something to you . This sentence never fits me . And I &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable with asking people &apos;s questions about it , and I think I &apos;m beginning to understand . I understand why . 
This sentence about dealing with adversity lives on the idea that success or happiness depends on it . Tackling a challenge without being shaped by the experience that it brings . As if my life had been so successful , because I could see the possible traps of a life with a prosthetic . Or anyway , people perceive me with my disability . 
But the truth is that we change . Of course , we are shaped by the challenge . Whether it &apos;s physical , emotional or even both , 
and I claim that &apos;s good . 
Distress is not an obstacle . We need to curve to make our lives clearer . 
Diversity is just part of our lives . 
And I tend to see distress as my shadow . 
Sometimes I realize it &apos;s very present . Sometimes it &apos;s hard to see . But it &apos;s always with me . 
And I don &apos;t want to mean by any means to reduce the impact or severity of a human struggle . 
There are distress and challenges in life . And they &apos;re all too real . And each person is different with it . But the question is not whether we can get clear with adversity or not . But how we get clear with it , 
so we &apos;re not just responsible for it . The people we love to keep from blows of fate , but also to prepare them for it . All right . 
To get clear . And we &apos;re not doing our kids a favor . If we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt . 
You have to separate two things clearly . One is that the medical fact is that they &apos;re amputee , and the other is that they &apos;re amputee . The social opinion about whether I &apos;m disabled or not . 
And to be honest , the only real and lasting disability I had to deal with is that the world is constantly saying . It can describe me with these definitions . 
In our desire to protect the people that care about us . And to tell you the cold , hard truth about your medical prognosis . Or even a prognosis about quality of life . If you expect it , we have to be careful not to lay the foundation for somebody actually being disabled . 
Maybe the current concept is . It &apos;s just about what &apos;s broken . And how we fix that for each individual , a greater disability than pathology itself . 
If we don &apos;t treat a person holistically and not all of his forces . And perceive possibilities . And recognize , in addition to the natural struggle that you may need to fight . 
Another disease . We degrade a person who has value for our society . 
So we need to go beyond patology . Look and focus on all areas of human possibilities . 
Most importantly . But is it that there is a difference between perception of our inadequacies and our great inventive spirit ? 
We should not devalue or deny these challenging times . We should not try to avoid them . We should not sweep them under the carpet , but rather , to recognize opportunities in adversity . 
I may be more interested in making it clear that we do not necessarily have to overcome adversity , but that we are open to it . Embrace them . Put them in the head to use a campaign expression . And maybe even dance with it . 
And maybe we can create adversity as something natural , coherent . And see useful . And feel like that through their presence no longer . So burdened 
this year , we celebrate Charles &apos; 200th birthday . Darwin : And when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , Darwin , in my view , has pointed out something very true in human character . 
I would describe it like this : Not the strongest of its kind survives . And not the smartest of its kind either , but the one that can best adapt to change . 
Conflict creates creativity , not just 
from Darwin &apos;s work . Do we know that man &apos;s ability to survive and flourish from the struggle of the human mind ? It &apos;s determined to change through conflict . 
So change again . And adaptation is the greatest ability of man . 
And maybe we know only from what wood . We &apos;re carved when we &apos;re really tested . 
Maybe that &apos;s the meaning of adversity . A perception of ego . A feeling of our own power . 
We can give ourselves something like that . 
We can give adversity a new meaning that goes beyond difficult times . 
Maybe we can see adversity as change . 
Adversity is a change . We haven &apos;t adapted yet . 
I think the greatest damage we &apos;ve done to ourselves is to believe that we should be normal . 
Let &apos;s be honest . Who &apos;s normal ? 
There &apos;s no normal . 
There &apos;s the usual one . The typical one , but not . The normal one . And would you really know this poor , gray person ? Do you want to learn if there were really ? 
I don &apos;t think so . 
It would be great . If we could counter this pattern of normality against another , the possibilities or the strength , to put it a little more dangerously . Could exchange . So we can unleash the forces of very many children . And invite them to put their very special and valuable skills into society . 
Anthropolgen has found that we humans , from the members of our society , have always demanded one thing : To be useful . And to contribute . 
There are indications that even the Neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , elderly people and people with severe physical injuries , were carrying . And that might have happened because the life experience in these people &apos;s struggle for survival was valuable to society . 
They didn &apos;t break these people as broken . And useless . They were seen as something special . And valuable . 
A few years ago , I went to the city where I grew up . I went to a food market in that Red Zone in the northeast of Pennsylvania , and I stood in front of a cup of tomatoes . 
It was summer . And I had shorts , and 
I hear a guy say behind me . Well , if that &apos;s not Aimee Mullins , 
and I turn around and see this older man . I had no idea . Who he is ? 
And I said , &quot; Excuse me . &quot; Sir , do we know ? I can &apos;t remember you , and 
he said , &quot; Well , you &apos;re unlikely to be . &quot; 
I remember when I first saw you , I saw her from her mother &apos;s belly . 
Oh , so , he 
did . And of course it did . But click . 
That was Dr. Kean , a man I only made of stories from my mother about that day . Because of course , I came two weeks late on my birthday , typical of that 
, the doctor for prenatal diagnostics . My mother was on vacation , and so my parents knew the man who gave me birth . Not at all . 
And because I was born without the legs of the calf . And my feet had turned to them , and I just had a few toes on this one and a few toes . On the other foot , he was the carrier , and this stranger had to deliver the bad news . 
He said to me , &quot; I had to tell your parents that you would never walk . And you would never be as mobile as other kids , or you would never live an independent life . &quot; And since then , they &apos;ve just been lying to me . Really punished . Exceptionally 
, I found that he collected newspaper clips of my entire childhood . Whether I was winning a letter contest in second grade . Whether I was traveling with the scout scouts on Halloween parade , whether I was on a scholarship or one of my sporting victories . And he used these clips to teach his students . Medical students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School , 
and he called this part of his course the X factor . The potential of human will , 
you can &apos;t stress enough how critical this factor is for a human being &apos;s quality of life . 
And Dr. Kean continued , &quot; He said , &quot; I learned that if you don &apos;t get something else constantly , children will get to be told . And even if they get a little bit of support , if you leave children to themselves , then children can achieve a lot . Look 
. Dr. Kean has his . Thinking changed . 
He had understood that medical diagnosis and how someone deals with it . 
Two different things are : And I too have changed my thinking over time . If you asked me at the age of 15 , if I had my prostheses exchanged for legs made of meat and bones . Would I not have hesitated for a second ? 
I absolutely wanted to be normal at the time . 
If you ask me that today , I &apos;m not so sure . 
And that &apos;s what happened . Because I &apos;ve experienced something with my legs . And not despite these experiences . 
And maybe that change could happen because I &apos;ve met so many people . They &apos;ve opened doors to me instead of meeting people who restrict me or wanted to muzzle me with an idea . You 
see , it really only takes one person . He &apos;s demonstrating to you how to manifest their forces . And they &apos;re through 
if they allow someone to . Activate their own inner forces . The human mind is so receptive . If you can do that and for someone to open a door at a critical moment . Then you &apos;re for these people . A very good teacher . 
You teach them to open doors to themselves . 
The real meaning of the word educate is rooted in the word educe . It 
means to create something that is in one : Tickle out the potential , 
again , what potential do you want ? So we &apos;re going to call you . 
In the &apos; 60s , a case study was done in the United Kingdom . Back then , high schools were transformed into schools . 
They call this streaming trials . In the United States , we call this tracking . 
Students are becoming . They &apos;re divided into grades , and 
the A students are getting more audited orally . The better teachers , etc . 
, they have students with enough grade , very good , over a three @-@ month period . They were told . They were Aces , they were very smart . And after those three months , they really wrote Einster . 
And of course , it breaks your heart to hear that the other way around , the Einster students were told . They were just enough , 
and that was the same . Then after the three months , too . But only 
those who were still in school , apart from the students who had thrown the school . 
And the key thing about this study was that the teachers were not inaugurated . 
The teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed . 
They were simply told that they were the Einser students , and that the students with the grade are sufficient , and they were taught something like that . 
And she treats the only real disability is a broken mind . A spirit that was broken has no hope anymore . It &apos;s not beautiful anymore . It lacks our natural , childish . Curiosity . And our innate ability to imagination , but 
if we can help the human mind do that . And then hope to continue to look beautiful at yourself and other people around you . Being curious and imaginative , then we really put our forces in a positive position . 
One , if a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new forms of existence . 
I want to end with a poem . This one by a Persian poet named Hafiz , written in the 14th century . And it was from which my friend Jacques Dembois told me , and the poem is called &quot; The God Who Knows Only Four Words . &quot; Every child doesn &apos;t know God , the God . The name , not the God of Forbitions , but the God . He knows only four words and repeats them all the time . He only always says , 
&quot; Come dance with me . &quot; &quot; Come dance with me . &quot; Thank you very much .
