A few years ago here at TED , Peter Skillman launched a design competition called &quot; The Marshmallow Challenge . 
&quot; The idea is pretty simple . Four teams have to have the widest possible freestanding structure with 20 spaghetti . CA : 1m tape . CA : 1m thread and build a marshmallow , 
the marshmallow has to be up on top . 
And though it &apos;s really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard . Because it &apos;s pushing people to work together very quickly . 
And so I thought this was a really interesting idea . And I did it into a design workshop . 
It was a huge success . 
Since then , I &apos;ve had about 70 workshops around the world with students , developers and architects , even CTOs , the Fortune 50 companies . And there &apos;s something about this task . What deep impressions into nature are about the nature of cooperation . And I want to share some of these with you . 
Normally , most people start themselves . As regards the task , orienting themselves . 
They talk about it . They think about what it will look like . They &apos;re rangling for power . 
Then they invest a little time in planning and organization . They sketch and put spaghetti out . 
They invest a lot of their time in assembling . Constantly growing structures . 
And finally , just before they don &apos;t have time anymore , someone takes the Marshmallow . And they put it gently on the top , step . One step back , and TA @-@ DA , admire your work . 
But then , almost always , what happens is that TA @-@ DA becomes an UH @-@ Oh , because the weight of the marshmallow causes the whole thing to bend and collapse . 
There &apos;s a series of people who have a lot more UH @-@ Oh moments than others . And among the worst are freshest BWL graduates . 
They lie , they cheat . They &apos;re confused and they produce really poor shapes . 
And of course , there are also teams that have a lot more TA @-@ DA formations . And among the best are freshness graduates of the kindergarten . 
And that &apos;s quite amazing . 
How Peter told us , they don &apos;t just produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all . 
What you might ask is , how does this come about ? Why ? What about those ? 
And Peter doesn &apos;t tell any of the kids , &quot; Is time investing ? &quot; In it , head of Spaghetti GmbH . They 
don &apos;t invest time in power struggles . 
There &apos;s still one more reason why . 
And that is that BWL students were trained to do a real plan . OK . 
And then to realize what then happens 
, what happens ? If you want to get the Marshmallow to the top , you don &apos;t have time anymore . And what happens ? 
It &apos;s a crisis . 
Sounds familiar . What ? What do 
kindergarten kids do differently is they do it with the Marshmallow and build prototypes . Successful prototypes , always with the Marshmallow at the top , so they &apos;re multiple times able to get dilapidated prototypes , repair . 
Constructors recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of an iterative process . 
And with every attempt , the kids get immediate feedback . What works ? And what doesn &apos;t work ? 
So this is performance with prototypes to work . But essentially , let &apos;s see how different teams operate . 
The average for most is about how different teams are , at about 50 centimeters , BWL students create . Half of them lawyers , a little bit more . But not much kindergarten kids are better than adults . 
Who is most successful architect 
and engineer ? Fortunately . 
1M : Is the highest . What I &apos;ve seen 
and why ? Because they understand triangles and self @-@ reinforcing geometric patterns . The key to stable structures is 
to build CEOs , something about average . But here it gets interesting . 
If you put an executive administrator . On the team , they get significantly better . 
It &apos;s incredible . You can see around and see this team is going to win . You 
can predict that . Why is that ? 
Because you have special process monitoring skills . 
You run the process . You understand it and that team . That regulates 
and focuses on work . It pays attention to the performance of the team significantly . 
Specialized skills and process skills and their combination lead to success . 
If you have 10 teams that are typical of what they do , you get . CA : 6 . The stable structures 
I tried , well , some exciting things . 
I thought , let &apos;s get the poker bet right . 
So I offered a $ 10,000 prize of software for the winners . 
What do you think ? Did this happen to these design students ? 
What was that ? 
Result : This was not a team that had a stable structure . 
If anyone had a two @-@ inch construction built , he would have won the prize home 
, if he had built it . Is it not interesting , then , that high betting has a strong effect ? 
We repeated this exercise with the same students . 
What do you think happened ? 
Well , you understood the advantage of prototyping . 
So it turned out of the same bad team , one of the best . 
They made the highest construction in the least time . 
There are , therefore , profound lessons for us about the nature of propulsion and success . 
You may ask , why would somebody actually invest time ? A Marshmallow challenge to 
create . The reason is , I help . Digital tools and processes to create teams to help . Cars , video games and visual effects to create . 
And what the Marshmallow Challenge does is it helps you create hidden assumptions , 
because it helps you , frankly , every project has its own Marshmallow . The challenge is to 
have a shared experience , a common language or a common attitude , to build the right prototype . 
And this is the value of this experience . This simple exercise 
and this one of you , who are interested in it , can be the 
MarshmallowChallenge . COM : Visit . It &apos;s a blog where you can see how to get the Marshmallows built . 
There &apos;s a step @-@ by @-@ step guide there . 
You &apos;ll find crazy examples from all over the world of how people optimize and refiner the system . 
There &apos;s also world records . 
And the basal lesson , I think , is the construction , actually , a connecting one . Sport is what 
it requires that we all have our senses on the task and that we have to think optimally about using our thinking , how our feelings and our actions are challenged , the challenges ahead of us . 
And sometimes , a small prototype . This experience , everything it takes . We &apos;re told from an UH @-@ Oh to a TA @-@ DA moment . 
And that can make a big difference . 
Thank you very much . 
Let &apos;s pretend we have here to have a machine . 
A big machine . A cool TED @-@ like machine . And that &apos;s a time machine . 
And everybody in this room has to enter . 
And you can enter the past . You can enter the future . You can &apos;t go into the here . 
And now stay . And I wonder what you choose . Because you would choose , because I &apos;ve been with my friends a lot lately . That question asked , and they wanted everybody in the past to go . 
I don &apos;t know . They wanted to go back to time before cars were there . Or Twitter or America is looking for the superstar . 
I don &apos;t know . 
I &apos;m convinced that somehow you &apos;re going to be drawn to nostalgia , to wishful thinking . 
And that &apos;s what I understand . 
I &apos;m not part of this group , I have to say . 
I don &apos;t want to go back to the past . And that &apos;s not because I &apos;m an adventurer . 
It &apos;s because opportunities on this group are not back on the planet . They &apos;re going forward . 
I want to go into this machine . And I want to go into the future . 
This is the greatest time it takes ever to be on this planet . No matter what scale you &apos;re going to take . Health , wealth . Mobility . Opportunities . Declining disease rates . There has 
never been a time like this before . 
My great grandparents all died when they were 60 . 
My grandparents urged this number to 70 . 
My parents are 80 to 80 . 
On the heels . There should be better a nine to the beginning of my death . 
But it &apos;s not even about people like us . Because this is a bigger thing . Than that 
a child who &apos;s in New Delhi today can be expected to be . So long as you live as the richest man on earth can be . 100 years ago , you 
think about it . This is an incredible fact . 
And why is this ? Skirts , 
smallpox , smallpox , have billions of people on the planet killed . 
They &apos;ve got the demographics of the Earth in a way that they &apos;ve redesigned . As no war . Je managed 
to do , they &apos;re gone . They &apos;ve disappeared . 
We &apos;ve defeated them . Puff 
in the rich world , diseases exist that millions of us have just one generation ago , threatened by . Hardly any 
diphtheria is yet rubbing , polio knows 
anything . Someone else , what that is ? 
Vaccines . Modern medicine . Our ability to reach out to billions of people . These are successes of the scientific method , 
and in my view , it &apos;s : Scientific method : Trying things out , see if it works . It changes . If it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity . 
This is , therefore , the good news . 
Unfortunately , this is already the whole good news . Because there &apos;s a few other problems . And they &apos;ve been mentioned many times , 
and one . One of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people in the world are hungry to go to bed every day . 
This number is rising , and it &apos;s rising very quickly . And that &apos;s embarrassing . 
And not only that . We have our imagination . We &apos;ve used this to thoroughly devastate this world : 
Drinking water , primal land . Rainforest , oil , gas . They disappear . And they disappear soon . And if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos , we disappear , too . 
The question is : So can we do that ? I think so . 
I think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food . The billions of people who feed without the land on which they live , without rape . 
I think we can make this world with energy that will feed them , that will not destroy them at the same time . 
I think that &apos;s really what it is . And no . That &apos;s not wishful thinking . 
But this is what keeps me awake at night . One of the things that awakes me at night . We have scientific progress never before , so much needed as we have never before . 
And we &apos;ve also never been to the point where we could use it reasonably . Just as we do today . 
We are at the threshold of amazing , amazing events on many fronts . And yet I really think we really have hundreds of 300 years before the Enlightenment , back to the point of time , to find a time . In which we fight progress , in which we talk about these things more vigorously , we &apos;ve been pushing . More fronts than we do now . 
People cover themselves up in their faith and that &apos;s so narrow that you can &apos;t do it free . 
Not even . The truth will liberate them and hear 
them . Everybody has a right to their opinion . Even a right to their opinion about progress . 
But you know what they don &apos;t have a right to . Do 
you not have a right to their own facts ? Blame . Do you not ? 
And I have a while to get that out of the way , 
about a decade ago , I published an article about immunization for The New Yorker , a little article . 
And I was amazed at resistance to meet resistance , resistance to resistance to what ended up being the most effective measure . In healthcare , in the history of humanity . 
I didn &apos;t know what to do . So I just did what I always do . I wrote an article and I went on . 
And soon thereafter , I wrote an article about genetically modified . Foodstuffs : The 
same thing , just bigger . 
People played crazy . 
So I also have a paper about it . And I couldn &apos;t understand why the people thought . That would be Frankenfood . Why ? They believed molecules were on a certain molecule , rather than a random way of moving around , an attack on the territory of nature . 
But you know , I do what I do . I wrote the article . I kept going . 
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist . 
We type . We pass in . We go eat . That &apos;s okay . 
But these articles made me worry . And I couldn &apos;t figure out . Why ? And eventually , I found out . 
And that &apos;s because these fanatics are the fanatics who made me crazy at all , not fanatics at all . 
These were prudent people , educated people , decent people . People , 
they were just like people in this room . 
And that brought me so confused . 
But then I thought , &quot; You know what ? Let &apos;s be honest . 
We &apos;re on one point , at which we &apos;re not at the same relationship to progress , right ? As in the past . 
We &apos;re talking about it in two ways . 
We &apos;re talking about it ironically , with little quotes . So progress . Okay 
. There &apos;s a reason for that . And I think we know what reasons that are . 
We have confidence in institutions , in authority . And sometimes in science , in itself , lost . And there &apos;s no reason why that &apos;s not so . 
You can just do a few names . And people will understand 
Chernobyl , Bhopal , Challenger , Vioxx , weapons of mass destruction . The 2000 US presidential election . I mean , 
you know , you can have your own list . 
There are questions and problems with the people of whom we are believed to be always having the right . Be , therefore , skeptical . 
Ask questions , ask for evidence , demand evidence . 
You need evidence . Take nothing 
but given . But now it &apos;s when you get evidence , you have to accept that evidence . And in that , we &apos;re not good at . And I 
can do that for the reason that we &apos;re now in a epidemic of epidemic of fear . As I told you , I &apos;ve never seen it before . And hopefully never again will see before 
about 12 years ago , it was . A story was published . A terrible story that the Autism epidemic had with the measles , mumps and rubells , vaccine , linked . 
Very scary . 
Haufenwise , studies were done to see if this was true , 
in a way . Studies were to be done . This is a serious matter . 
The data came in . 
The data came in from the United States . England , Sweden , Canada . And they were all the same , no correlation . No connection , no connection at all . 
It doesn &apos;t make any difference . It doesn &apos;t make any difference . Because we &apos;re believing in anecdotes . We believe what we see , what we see , what we believe to see . What causes us to really feel real ? 
We don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents from a government clerk who gives us data . And I understand that . I think that &apos;s what we all do . 
But you know what ? 
The result of that was catastrophic , catastrophic . 
Because of this fact , the United States is one of the only countries in the world . In which the vaccine rate for measles is falling . 
That &apos;s scandalous . And we should be ashamed . 
It &apos;s terrible . 
What happened is that we do that , we could . Well 
, I understand that . That &apos;s what I do . Because here 
&apos;s somebody who has measles , 
has one in the audience . Anyone else at measles who sees death 
doesn &apos;t happen very often . 
In this country , not at all . But 160,000 times , in the world . In the last year , 
these are many deaths from measles : 20 per hour . 
But because that &apos;s not what happened here . Can we push it out ? And people like Jenny McCarthy can walk around and send messages of fear and illiteracy , platforms like Oprah and Larry , King Live , preach . And 
that &apos;s what they can do because they cause and correlation not connect . 
They don &apos;t understand that these things are the same . But almost never , the same . 
And that &apos;s something that we learn to learn . And that &apos;s very fast . 
This guy was a hero . Jonas Salk : 
He liberated us from one of the worst scourges of humanity . Don &apos;t worry 
, no pain , polio . Puff disappeared . 
The guy in the middle . Not so much . 
His name is : Paul Offit : 
He &apos;s just got a few other people with a Rotavirus vaccine . 
He can live the lives of 400 , 500,000 children a year in the developing world in the developing world . 
Very good . Not , 
well . That &apos;s good . Apart from Paul walking around and talking about vaccines and saying , &quot; How valuable ? &quot; They are , and people are just stopping , right ? To complain , 
and that &apos;s what he actually says . 
Paul is a terrorist . 
So if Paul is in a public hearing , he can &apos;t speak without armed guards . 
He gets calls at home because the people tell him they like to tell him where they know where his kids are going to school . 
And why ? Because Paul has made a vaccine . 
I need not say that . But vaccines are essential . 
Take them away . Turn the diseases back . Terrible diseases . And that &apos;s what &apos;s happening right now . 
We have in this country now measles . 
And that &apos;s getting worse . And pretty soon , kids will get to die of it again . Because that &apos;s just a question of numbers . 
And they &apos;re not just going to die of measles . 
What about polio ? Let &apos;s take that . Why not ? 
A fellow militant of mine told me a few weeks ago , and she said , &quot; She believes . I &apos;m a little too shrill . 
Nobody has that . &quot; Ever before , 
she said she would not fight polio against polio . No way , 
fine . 
Why ? Because we don &apos;t have polio . And you know what ? 
We had in this country yesterday no polio . 
Today , I don &apos;t know . Maybe today morning rose . Someone in Lagos went on an airplane and is flying right to Los Angeles . Right now , he &apos;s over Ohio . 
And into a few hours , he lands . And he rents a car . And he comes to Long Beach . And he becomes one of these fantastic TED dinner . This evening , he goes to visit , 
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a paralyzing disease . And we know that , either . Because that &apos;s how the world works . Well , 
that &apos;s the planet on which we live . Do not do it as if it 
&apos;s not . We love it in lies . We love to cover it up . 
We love that . Do you have everybody this morning your vitamins ? 
Echinacea . A little antioxidant that will put you on the leaps . 
I know you &apos;re doing that . Because the half of the Americans , that every day , do that . 
They take the stuff . And they take alternative remedies . And it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re useless . 
The data shows this all the time . 
They evaporate their urine more . Do almost never . 
This is okay . You like 28 billion dollars for the dark urine to pay . 
I agree with you completely 
: Dark urine , dark . 
Why do we do this ? Why do we do this ? 
Well , I think I understand we hate the pharmaceutical industry . 
We hate one too strong government . We don &apos;t have confidence in the system . 
And that &apos;s what we shouldn &apos;t do either . Our healthcare system is bad . 
It &apos;s cruel to millions of people . 
It &apos;s absolutely amazing , cold and soul @-@ depressing , even to us who can afford it . 
We &apos;re running away from it . And where are we going ? 
We &apos;re walking in the arms of the placebo industry . 
This is great . I love the placebo industry . 
But you know , this is really a serious matter . Because the stuff is crap . And we &apos;re giving billions of dollars for it . 
And I &apos;ve got all sorts of little props here , 
none of them : Gingko fraud , Echinacea fraud , Acai , I don &apos;t even know what . This is , but we give billions of dollars for it . It &apos;s cheating . 
And you know what ? If I say this , the screams are screaming at me and saying , &quot; What cares you ? &quot; &quot; Let people do what they do , anyway . 
&quot; This is how they feel good . And 
you know what ? They &apos;re wrong 
because it doesn &apos;t matter to me whether it &apos;s the Health Minister . He says , &quot; Hmm . &quot; I &apos;m going to get the evidence from my experts on mammography . Don &apos;t assume . Or any cancer quack ointment that can inject coffee into his patients . 
If you look at this path , where do you think and magic , evidence and science replace , you get to a place where you can &apos;t be , you don &apos;t want to be . 
You get to Thabo Mbeki in South Africa . 
He brought 400,000 of his people around because he was insisting on insisting that red beds , garlic and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs . Of those we know they &apos;re the course of AIDS @-@ inhibiting , you know . 
Hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country worse than any other of these diseases plagued by it . 
Tell me , please don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences . 
They have them . They always have them . 
Now , the most unwieldy epidemic we have just been to is this absurd fight between the two proponents of genetically modified foods and the bio @-@ elite . 
That &apos;s an idiotic debate . It has to stop . 
It &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors . 
That &apos;s ideology . It &apos;s not science . 
Everything we eat . Every grain of rice , every branch of parsley . Every sprouts have been made by people . 
You know , there were no mandarin in paradise . 
There were no cantaloupe melons . There were no Christmas trees . We have all done this . 
We have it in the last 11 000 years . 
And some of it worked . And some of it didn &apos;t . 
We got rid of it . What doesn &apos;t work . 
Now we can do it more precisely . And of course , there are risks . But we can do something like vitamin A in rice . And the stuff can be helpful to millions of people . Millions of people live longer . That &apos;s 
not what they want to do . 
I have to say , I don &apos;t understand . 
We reject genetically modified . We reject food . 
Why do we do that ? 
Well , what I hear all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones . Mono @-@ culture . We don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing . That &apos;s wrong . 
We don &apos;t want companies to patent lives . 
We don &apos;t want companies to own seeds . 
And you know what ? My answer to all of this is 
yes . You &apos;re right . Let &apos;s fix that . 
It &apos;s true . We have a huge food problem . But that &apos;s not science . 
That &apos;s science . It &apos;s not science . 
It &apos;s right . Morality , patent crab . 
You know that science is not a company . 
It &apos;s not a country . 
It &apos;s not even an idea . It &apos;s a process . 
It &apos;s a process . And sometimes it works . And sometimes it doesn &apos;t . But the idea that we can give science no permission to do their work . Because we &apos;re afraid , it &apos;s a real impasse . And it keeps millions of people from flourishing . 
AB : You know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to grow 70 percent more food than we do at the moment . 70 percent . 
That investment in Africa in the last 30 years has 
been shameful , shameful . 
You need that . And we &apos;re giving it to you . 
And why ? Genetically modified food . 
We want people not to be encouraged . This rotten stuff to eat , like , Maniok Maniok is 
Maniok . Something that &apos;s half a billion people eating . 
It &apos;s about like a potato . 
It &apos;s just a bunch of calories . It &apos;s bad . 
It doesn &apos;t have nutrients . It doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists build it . All of this , just inside of it . 
And then the people could eat the food and wouldn &apos;t be blinded . 
They wouldn &apos;t starve . And you know what ? 
That would be nice . It wouldn &apos;t be Chez Panisse . But it would be nice , 
and everything I say about it is why fight against this . 
I mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves . Why fight this ? 
Because we don &apos;t want to push genes around . 
It &apos;s not about pushing genes around . It &apos;s not about chemicals . 
It &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones . Our insistence on greater food , better food , unique food . 
It &apos;s not about rice krispies . It &apos;s about people living . It &apos;s about keeping people alive . And it &apos;s high time to understand what this means . 
Because , you know what ? 
If we don &apos;t do that , if we keep on going as we do . Let &apos;s get to blame for something that we believe we owe , I don &apos;t want to be guilty of . High @-@ tech colonialism . 
There &apos;s no other description for that that that &apos;s happening here . 
It &apos;s selfish . It &apos;s ugly . It &apos;s not worthy of us . And we have to really stop that . 
After this incredibly fun conversation , you want to say , maybe you always want to be in this ridiculous time machine . And into the future 
, go on , anyway . That &apos;s what I want anyway . 
Right now , she &apos;s in the present . But we have an incredible opportunity . 
We can use this time machine to put everything we want . 
We can move it where we can move it . And we will move it to where we want it to be . 
We need to have these conversations . And we need to think . But if we go into the time machine and into the future , we will be happy to see . That &apos;s what we &apos;ve done . 
I know we &apos;ve been able to do it . And as far as I &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something that the world needs now . 
Thank you . 
Thank you . Thank you . When Steve Lopez , columnist of the Los Angeles Times , One day through the streets in the center of Los Angeles , one day he heard a wonderful music . 
She came from a man , an African @-@ American , sympathetic , rough , homeless , who was playing on a violin that had only two strings left . 
Many of you will hear the story , because from Steve &apos;s articles about it , later on , a book was filmed . With Robert Downey Junior , when Steve Lopez and Jamie Foxx , when Nathaniel Anthony Ayers , the contrabass player at the Juilliard Conservatory , studied and his promising career . Tragically early on , through his paranoid schizophrenia , he was terminated . 
Nathaniel left Juilliard , suffered a nervous breakdown , and 30 years later , he lived as homeless on the streets of Skid Row . In the center of Los Angeles . 
I recommend to all of you that you read Steves &apos; book or watch the movie so that you can not only see the wonderful connection between these two men that arose between them , but also how music , this connection , creates . Helped and how they eventually helped the instrument when this play of words is allowed , which is half the way . Nathaniel , away from the street , to get away . 
I met Mr. Ayers . In 2008 , two years ago , in the Walt Disney Concert Hall . 
He just had a demonstration of Beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony and four , and he came behind the stage to get to imagine myself . 
He spoke in a very cheerful and sociable tone about yo @-@ yo . MA : And Hillary Clinton and about how the Dodgers never heard it into baseball world , and how the baseball world series would do it . And all of this because of the insidious passage . The first violin in the last sentence of Beethoven &apos;s Fourth Symphony . 
We came up with the theme of &quot; Music &quot; and a few days later , I got an email saying , &quot; Nathaniel is in favour of violin lessons with me . 
&quot; &quot; I have to mention that Nathaniel is a medical treatment that he refused , because he was already in the process of electroshocks and thorazin and handcuffs . Trauma that has caused him to suffer all his life 
as a result of that is now particularly vulnerable . For these schizophrenic phases . They &apos;re sometimes so bad that they can make him tear up . And he disappears for days . In the streets of Skid Row , he &apos;s always wandering around this horror and the torture torment of his own mind . And in exactly 
one stage of irritation , Nathaniel was when we were with our first lesson in our Walt Disney at the Concert Hall . He had this crazy flicker in his eyes and he was working completely lost . 
He talked about invisible demons and smoke and about how he was being told in sleep how someone wanted to poison him . 
I was afraid , not for me , but I was afraid that I could lose him , that he could be in one of his states , and that I could lose him his relationship with the violin . If I started talking about clay ladders and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy , 
I would say , I would just start talking to you . 
I would play the first sentence of Beethoven &apos;s violin concerto . 
And while I was playing , I noticed that in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes , a complete change is taking place . 
It was as if he was going to be under the influence of an invisible doctor . A chemical reaction , the catalyst of which was my game , 
turned Nathaniel &apos;s maniac anger into understanding , into a calm curiosity and grace . 
And as if by a miracle , he took his violin and began to listen . Some excerpts of violin concerts to play and asked me to play them to the end , then . Mendelssohn Chaikovsky , Sibelius . 
We then started talking about music . From Bach to Beethoven , Brahms , Bruckner and all the others BS of Bartók to Beethoven , Brahms , Bruckner and all the other BS from Esa @-@ Pekka Salonen . 
And I realized that he didn &apos;t just have an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but he not only had it . He also had a close personal relationship . 
He talked about it with a passion and a sense that was my other passion and understanding , which I would only talk about with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic , 
playing music and talking about music , and that paranoid , confused . Man who &apos;s just been through the streets of Los Angeles , who had just moved . A kind , educated , excellent Juilliard musician , who has become a good musician . 
Music is medicine . Music changes us 
for Nathaniel , means music is mental health . 
Because music allows us to give him his thoughts and delusions with the help of his imagination and creativity into something real 
, real . And so he escapes his tormenting state . 
I understood that this is the very nature of art . 
Exactly . This is why this is why we make music so that we can do something that is deep inside of us all . Our feelings through our artistic lens , through our creativity , towards reality , can shape . 
And reality of that expression reaches us all , and moves , inspires and unites us . 
What Nathaniel was doing , the Nathaniel brought him back to a community of friends . 
The redeeming power of music brought him back to a family , from musicians who brought him to understanding . Those who recognized his talent and respected him , 
and I &apos;m going to talk to Nathaniel again and again . Whether in the Walt Disney Concert , Hall or in Skid , Row , because he reminds me of why I was a musician , 
Thank you very much . 
Bruno Giussani : Thank you very much . Thank you . 
Robert Gupta , 
Robert Gupta : I want to play something that I shamefully stolen from the cellist . 
I hope you will forgive me . 
I &apos;m Jane McGonigal . I design computer games . 
I &apos;m now developing for 10 years online games . And my goal for the next decade is to do just as easily as possible . The world where reality is saving the world as it does in online games is 
saving . I have a plan for that . I want more people to convince , including all of you , more time playing with bigger and more amazing games , too . 
Right now , we spend three billion hours a week playing online . 
Some of you may think , &quot; This is a lot of time for games . 
Maybe something too much time . &quot; If you think about how many problems we &apos;re facing in real world as a 
matter of urgency , you know ? In fact , but my research at the Institute for the Future , according to me , is exactly the opposite . 
Right ? Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to make the most pressing problems in the world solved . 
Indeed , I am convinced that if we are to move to this planet for the next century , we will dramatically increase this time . 
I calculated that the time needed to do that is 21 billion hours of playing time . Per week 
, that &apos;s what it looks like . First , maybe a little bit absurd . So I repeat it with that . It can work if we can have problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , and I think we have to try . Play online for at least 21 billion hours a week , up to the end of the next decade . 
No . I mean , it &apos;s really serious . 
Why ? This picture 
describes quite precisely . Why ? I think games like this are so vital to the survival of the human species in the future . Serious . 
This is a portrait of photographer Phil Toledano . 
He wanted to share the feelings of playing . So he &apos;s in front of the players , he &apos;s built a camera . 
This is one of the classic expressions . 
When playing , if you &apos;re not a player , you may miss some of the nuances . In this picture , 
you probably see this sense of urgency . Something scared . But also extreme concentration , deepened . In solving a real difficult problem , 
If you play , you &apos;ll see some nuances here that look up there , the eyes that are drawn up . And the mouth is a sign of optimism . The eyebrows show surprise . 
This is a player who &apos;s on the edge of what &apos;s called an epic . Victory 
is , oh , you know that . 
OK . Great . So we have some players here , 
an epic . Victory is a result that &apos;s so very positive that it &apos;s so positive that you didn &apos;t even know before that it was possible at all . 
It was almost beyond imagination . And if you can do it , you &apos;re shocked that you actually have to be able to do 
that . That &apos;s an epical victory for 
these players , and it &apos;s just about to be an epic victory . 
And this is what we &apos;re going to see on millions of faces of problem solvers around the world . If we can overcome the hurdles of the next century , the face of those who face the odds of all odds on the edge of an epic victory . 
Well , unfortunately , we see this face more in real life . If we face difficult problems , 
I call it the one in life , I &apos;m bad face . 
And it &apos;s actually my face . Look , yeah . OK . 
That &apos;s me . How I do that in life ? I &apos;m bad face . Do 
this . This is a graffiti in my former home country in Berkeley , California , where I studied in my PhD thesis . Why do we do better in games than in real life ? 
This is a problem . This is a problem that many players have . 
We think that in reality , we &apos;re not as good as in games . And 
I don &apos;t mean just less successful . Although that &apos;s part of it , 
we &apos;re doing more in games . 
I mean , good in connection with motivation , something important about doing . Inspired in collaboration with each other . 
If we &apos;re in a game world , I think many of us are in our game world , turning into our best version , always and immediately ready to help , persistent in solving the problem . Try trying to solve it as long as necessary after the failure . And in reality 
, if we fail , if we fail , if we encounter obstacles , we often feel different . We feel overwhelmed . 
We feel ourselves . We feel defeated , we feel threatened . Maybe depressed . Frustrated , right ? Cynical ? These feelings 
we never have . If we play games in games , there are just no games . 
And that &apos;s what I call &quot; PhD student &quot; to study . Why is 
it in games ? Impossible to think . You couldn &apos;t just achieve everything . 
How can we make those feelings out of the games come to reality ? 
So I looked at games like World of Warcraft . It &apos;s the ideal environment for playing together to solve problems . 
And I have a few things to say . The epic victories in online worlds . 
As possible , so first of all , if you &apos;re in one of these online games , especially at World of Warcraft , there are a lot of different characters ready to give you a world saving mission . And that &apos;s immediate . 
But not just any mission , but a mission . The mission perfect for your current level in the game . 
Right ? So you can do that . 
You never get a task that you don &apos;t solve . 
But always on the edge of your skills , so you have to make an effort . 
But there &apos;s no unemployment . In World of Warcraft , you don &apos;t sit around and turn around demons . There &apos;s always a very specific , important thing to do . And 
there &apos;s a lot of staff wherever 
you go . Hundreds of thousands of people working with them to get their epic mission . 
Concluding . That &apos;s what we have in real life . Not so easy . That feeling that , when you have a fingercut , you have staff who are willing to do it . 
There &apos;s also this epic story . This inspiring story , why we &apos;re there . And what we do is then what we get this whole thing positive feedback . 
You &apos;ve probably got from level up and level 1 strength , or 1 intelligence . 
This constant feedback is not there in the real world . 
If I &apos;m leaving this stage , I don &apos;t have 1 speech and 1 crazy idea . 20 . Crazy idea . 
I get in real life . 
This feedback , not . So the problem of collaborative online worlds like World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying . Anytime on the edge of an epic victory , that we prefer to keep standing in the margins of these games all the time . 
They &apos;re just better than reality . 
So far , all of the World of Warcraft players together have 5.93 million years spent on virtual problems of Azeroth , 
which are solved . This is not necessarily a bad thing . 
It may sound bad . 
But to put it in context , it might sound bad 5.93 million years ago . Our first primate ancestors started walking upright . 
The first upright primacy . 
So OK . So if we talk about how much time we currently spend with games , it does , just make sense . When you start to spend time with regard to the magnitude of human development before you look at it . 
What &apos;s extraordinary , but also appropriate . Because it turns out that we have to do this by doing this all the time playing , actually changing it . What we as humans do as human beings are 
capable of . We develop into a community . Thinking , heartfelt beings . 
That &apos;s the truth . That &apos;s what I believe in . 
Look at it . This interesting statistic that &apos;s been recently published by a researcher of Carnegie Mellon University . The average young person today in the middle of a country with a strong playing culture spends . 10,000 hours with online games , up to the age of 21 . 
So 10,000 hours is a very , very interesting number of two reasons . 
First of all , for kids in the United States , 10,080 hours is the exact total time they spend in school , from the five @-@ grade to the end of the high school . If you never lack it , 
so here we have a complete parallel education path where young people are . The same way that we learn what it means . A good player to be like everything else , whatever you &apos;re in school learning . And maybe 
some of you have that new book from Malcolm , Gladwell . Overflying . So you know his theory of success . The theory of success of 10,000 dollars of success . 
It &apos;s based on great research , cognitive science , that if we read 10,000 hours with the laborious study of a given subject , up to the age of 21 , we will master . In that , 
we will do so well in it . Whatever it may be to do , like the most important people in the world . 
So what we have here is a complete generation of young people , the master players , 
who are the big question , so what exactly are players ? Masterfully good . Because 
if we figure out that out , we would never have been able to have any human potential that we could have 
known before . So many people we have at the moment in the world who have at least an hour a day playing online . 
These are our master players , 500 million people . The extraordinary . Good . In something . 
And in the next decade , we have another billion players , which are exceptionally good at what they are . 
If you still don &apos;t hear it , 
the game industry has developed consoles that save energy . And on mobile networks , instead of broadband Internet , they work . So that players all over the world , especially in India . China , Brazil , playing online , 
you can expect . An additional billion players next decade are expected . 
So we &apos;ve got a total of 1.5 billion players . 
So I started to think about what it is . What these games are going to do to us 
? Here are the four things I do find . First , urgency optimism . 
OK . Imagine if that &apos;s extreme self @-@ motivation . 
Urgent optimism is desire to do something right away . A hurdle to master , along with faith that we have a well @-@ founded hope of success . 
Players always believe that a epic is an possible victory , and that it &apos;s always possible and worthwhile to try and do it . 
And that &apos;s the same : Players don &apos;t sit around . 
Players are masters in spiders . Poet social networks . 
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research . They show that we people like more . After we have played with them , even if they &apos;re evil at us . 
The reason for that is that it &apos;s a lot of trust that requires you to play a game with someone . 
We trust that somebody will have time with us , that people will respect the rules , that we will achieve the same goal . And by the end of the game . 
And so that &apos;s where the game is allowed to play together . That &apos;s where the growth of ties , trust and interconnectedness is going . 
And as a result , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships , happy 
productivity . Fantastic . 
You know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of Warcraft player is 22 hours a week . So , part @-@ time job . 
The reason is that if we play , we &apos;re actually happier at it , working hard . As if we relax or nothing , or do . 
We know that we are human beings , we function optimally . If we are hard , meaningful work , 
and players are always ready to work hard . If they are the right job , 
and eventually epic meaning , 
players love it , part awe . Herring Missions of planetary dimensions . 
Here &apos;s a background information to get this right . You probably know all Wikipedia . The biggest Wiki in the world . The 
second largest Wiki in the world , with almost 80,000 entries , is : The World of Warcraft Wiki : 
Five million people use it every month . 
They have more information about World of Warcraft . They &apos;ve collected it online than any other topic in any other Wiki that &apos;s in the world . 
They create an epic story . 
They create an epic source of knowledge about the World of Warcraft . 
OK . These are four superpowers , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single result . Players are super @-@ powerful , hopeful individuals . 
They &apos;re human beings . They believe they &apos;re individual , they believe , they can change the world . 
And the only problem is they can believe . They can do the virtual worlds change . But not the real . 
That &apos;s the problem I have to solve . 
Edward Castronova is a scientist , 
his work is brilliant . 
He &apos;s studying . Why people do so much time , energy and money spend in online worlds ? 
And he says , &quot; We are witnessing no less than a mass emigration into virtual worlds . &quot; And online gaming environments , 
and this by an economist , so he &apos;s logical . 
And he doesn &apos;t say the way I do . I develop games . I &apos;m a little bit exuberant . 
So he says , &quot; This actually makes sense . &quot; Because players can play more online worlds than they can in real life . 
They can play stronger social ties in games than they do in real life . They get more feedback and rewards . In games than in real life , 
so he says , &quot; It &apos;s perfectly logical right now that players have more time in the virtual world than in real life , 
&quot; I &apos;m going to agree . This is logical . 
But it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation . 
We have to start to build the real world into a game . 
My inspiration comes from an event . The 2nd . 500 years . It &apos;s back . 
There are these ancient cubes . Sheepcrumbs . You know , in front 
of these fantastic game econtrollers , there were sheep &apos;s necks . 
And these were , so to speak , the first people to develop . Play equipment . And if you &apos;re working with the works of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus . You may know ? This story , the story about how and why games were invented . 
According to Herodotus , games became more accurate craps in the kingdom of Lydia . During a famine , 
invented , allegedly there was such a great famine that the king of Lydia was turning into a crazy idea , right 
? People suffered the people , people fought . 
It was an extreme situation . It took an extreme solution . 
So they invented , according to Herodotus . The dice game and agreed a national strategy . On one day , you would eat . The next day , you would play . 
And they would play so much into the dice game . There games so fascinating and so fascinating and satisfying , happy productivity surround us that they forget they would be nothing , nothing to eat . 
And then the next day , you would play . And the next day , you would eat . 
And according to Herodotus , they survived for 18 years . This famine by living on one day . And on the next day 
they played , and I think we &apos;re going to do the same . Today , we &apos;re going to play . 
We &apos;re going to play games to help the suffering of the real world . We &apos;re going to play games to escape everything that &apos;s going on in the real world . Everything that &apos;s going on in real life is not satisfactory . And we &apos;re going to get what we need . From the games . 
But that doesn &apos;t have to be the end . 
That &apos;s the exciting thing . 
According to Herodotus , after 18 years of famine , it wasn &apos;t getting any better . So the king decided one last cube game . 
They shared the kingdom . In two halves . 
They played a cube game . And the winners were allowed to become an epic adventure . 
Break up , they left lydia and set out to search for a new home . They just let so many people go back as they could buy food to survive . And they were looking for the rest of the area where they thrive , 
with the rest . That sounds crazy , right ? 
But the latest DNA evidence shows that the Etruscans , who later became the Roman Empire , are the ones who made it . The same DNA as the old Lydier has . 
So scientists recently came to the conclusion that herodotus is actually crazy history . 
And geologists found evidence of global cooling that is almost 20 years long , which was the explanation of famine . 
So this crazy story could be true . Maybe 
they actually have their people through games saved by playing by getting 18 years of saving themselves in games , and they could have saved them . And then this inspiration had , and so much about coexistence with each other , that they learned by doing that , they saved the whole civilization . 
So , we can . 
We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft since 1994 . 
This was the first strategy game in real time . The World of Warcraft series . 
This was 16 years ago . 
They played 18 years of craps . We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft for 16 years . 
I &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic . Game . 
So they sent half of their civilization to the search for the search for a new world . So I &apos;m taking my 21 billion hours of play a week . We should agree that the half of the world is one hour 
per day with games , and we should agree that we &apos;re spending half of our time playing . Until we solve the problems of the real 
world . I know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; How do we solve problems ? &quot; The real world in games . And 
that &apos;s exactly the question I &apos;ve got my work on in recent years at the Institute for the Future . 
We &apos;ve got this banner in our office in Palo Alto . It expresses how we can shape the future . 
We don &apos;t want to try to predict the future before 
what we want . Is the future to 
be created ? We want to make the best possible outcome . And then people are empowered to empower this idea into reality . 
We face epic victories . And we give people the opportunity to give them the opportunity to reach them . 
I &apos;m going to show you three games very briefly that I designed to try and try to emulate people . In their own future , to get this . 
This is a world without oil . 
The game is from 2007 . 
It &apos;s an online game where you can get out of oil shortages . 
Oil shortages are invented . But we have enough online content to make it realistic for you . And you can make your real life , actually , without oil . So if you &apos;re playing , if you sign up , tell us where you live . And then you get news films in real time that show you how much oil costs , what it doesn &apos;t exist . How food supplies are affected , 
how transport is . It &apos;s affected whether schools are closed , whether there are riots . And you have to figure out how to make your real life . If it were true , and we ask you to blog about it , videos or photos . 
We have this game with 1,700 , and we played in 2007 . And we &apos;ve been testing it since then over the last three years . 
And I can tell you , it was a changing experience . 
Nobody wants to change their lives because it &apos;s good for the environment . Or ? Because we should . 
But if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and you &apos;re told , &quot; Get us , oil is out . 
&quot; That &apos;s a fascinating adventure that we can go on . 
Find out how you survive . Most of our players have the ones in the game that have kept the habits that we learned . So we &apos;ve 
chosen to go for the next world saving game . A bigger , higher goal than just oil shortages . 
We &apos;ve got the Superstruct game at the Institute for the Future . 
The starting point is to calculate a supercomputer that people only have 23 years left to work on the planet . 
This supercomputer is called Global . Existence / Sensitization System . Of course , 
the call to players to sign up . Do we have almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie ? 
You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies , where it &apos;s the dream team . You have the astronaut , the scientist , the ex @-@ Sträfling , and just together . Can you tell the world to save ? But 
in our game . Instead of just five people , we say , &quot; Everyone is on the dream team . &quot; And it &apos;s our job . The future for energy , food , health , safety and the future of social justice to create . 
8,000 players played that game . Eight weeks . 
They found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they read about . If you Google Superstruct and 
the last game bring us to the 3rd of March . It &apos;s a game in collaboration with the World Bank . 
If you play that game , you get from the World Bank the award of social . Reformer @ 2010 completion . 
We work with universities all over Sub @-@ Saharan Africa and invite them to redesign socially , learn how to do it . 
We have a comic book on that . We have levels high for regional understanding . Knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and ingenuity . 
I want to invite you all to play this game with young people . Everywhere on Earth , especially in the development areas . Those who benefit from this , together , their own social ventures to imagine the world to 
save . I &apos;m going to finish now . 
I want to ask you something : 
What do you think is happening ? 
Next . We have all these fantastic players . We have games that show us what we &apos;re able to do . But we have the real world , not yet saved . 
Well , I hope you will tell me that players agree that human resources are the human resources that we need to work in real life . And that games are very important for change . 
We have all these superpowers , happy productivity . The ability to have tight social networks , urgency optimism . And the desire for epiepical meaning . 
I really hope that together we will have important games to play together to make another major century on this planet . 
And I hope you will join me in playing these games and playing them . 
When I go to the next decade , I &apos;m looking forward to two things : That we can imagine any future that we can create , and that we can play all kinds of games . So I &apos;m saying , let &apos;s play the world @-@ changing games . Let &apos;s start . 
Thank you . 
For some time now , I &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect . It may seem strange that a game magician is interested in it . It &apos;s unless you look at it like me , as a deception that leads to something real , right ? If someone is just stuck with believing in it , 
in other words , have sugar pills . In some studies , a measurable effect has been shown to be the placebo effect , and that &apos;s just because of it . Because the person thinks what to do with it is . A pharmaceutical or some kind of in pain management . For example , if the patient is only solid enough to get into it , there &apos;s a measurable effect in the body that &apos;s called the placebo effect . 
A deception becomes something real because it &apos;s something real because somebody 
perceives it so that we can understand each other . I &apos;m going to give you a basic , very simple magic trick . 
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . This is a trick that has been around for at least the 1950s in every children &apos;s magic book . I myself have taken 
it from the Cub Scout Magic . The scout scout in the 1970s . 
I &apos;m going to do it for you , and then explain it . 
And then I &apos;m going to explain why I explain it . 
So you see what happens . 
The knife you &apos;re able to look at . My hand you &apos;re able to look at . 
I &apos;m going to just put the knife in my fist . 
I &apos;m pushing my sleeves back . 
And to make sure that nothing in my sleeves disappears or disappears from it , I &apos;m just going to put my wrist right here . 
And so in this way , you can see that at no time is anything moving . As long as I &apos;m pressurizing here , nothing can go into my sleeves or come out . 
And the goal is , quite simply . 
I &apos;m going to open my hand . And hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife will go through my bare physical magnetism . 
It &apos;s actually so tight . It &apos;s in its place that I can shake it without the knife falling down . Nothing moves . 
In my sleeves , or comes out , no trickery . And you can study everything . 
TA @-@ DA : 
Well , this is a trick that I often teach small kids who are interested in magic . Because you can do a lot about deception , because you can learn a lot about deception . If you look more closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick to do . 
I think many of you here probably know . This trick , 
it works like this . 
I think the knife is . In my hand , 
I say I &apos;m going to close my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or comes out . And that &apos;s a lie . 
The reason I &apos;m going to tie my wrist is because it &apos;s the real secret of the illusion . 
In the moment that I &apos;m going to shake my hand away from you so that you can see it moving from behind . This finger is moving here , my index finger , just from where it was , to a position where it was stretched out like this . 
Great trick , 
back there . Is there somebody 
who had no childhood ? So he &apos;s here right now . 
And if I turn around , the finger changes its position . 
And now you could talk about why this is a deception . Why not perceive that this is down here just three fingers to see ? Because the reason is there , and the way it &apos;s processing information , it &apos;s not counting individually . One , two , three , but seeing it as a group . 
But that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about . Now here . Actually , not at all . And then I open my hand . 
Of course , it &apos;s held there . But not through magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my index finger , which is there now . 
And if I put my hand in , the same thing happens by turning back , it &apos;s hidden by this movement that the finger moves back . 
I take this hand away . And here &apos;s the knife . 
This trick you can use to get your friends and neighbors to perform . Thank you . 
Now , what does this have with the placebo effect ? 
Well , a year ago or so , I read a study that really cut me around . 
I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher . And so that was for me a really amazing thing . 
It turned out to be this . If you have a placebo in the form of a white pill , in the form of an aspirin tablet , it &apos;s just a round of white pill that has a certain measurable effect . 
But if you have the shape in which you have the placebo administered , for example , into a smaller pill . And this blue color and a letter on it is it that actually can be measured , more effective . 
And that , though none of these are any pharmaceutical . They &apos;re just sugar pills . 
But a white pill is not that good as a blue pill . 
What that made me really freak out of it . 
It turned out , however , that this hasn &apos;t all happened yet . 
If you take capsules , they &apos;re even more effective than tablets . Any shape , 
a colored capsule , that &apos;s yellow at one end . And on the other side , red is better than a white capsule . The 
dosage also plays a role , a 
pill twice a day is not so good as three pills . I can now &apos;t get to the exact statistics . Remember ? Do I &apos;m sorry . 
The key thing ? But is that 
the dosage also has a role to play . 
And the shape plays a role . 
And if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to grab the needle . 
Right ? A syringe with an ineffective one , a few milliliters of an ineffective substance , that you inject into a patient . 
That creates a very strong image . In the head , that &apos;s much stronger than a white pill . 
This graph is really . I &apos;m going to give you another time . If we have a projector , 
the fact is that the white pill is not so good at working as the blue pill . Pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle . 
And none of this has any really pharmaceutical property . It &apos;s just our belief in it that &apos;s inside us , stronger effect . 
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a magic trick . 
I take something that obviously is a deception , and I leave it to look real . 
We know from that study that we can say you can grab a needle . If it &apos;s going to get to the point , 
this is a 18 @-@ inch @-@ long needle . It &apos;s very , very sharp . And I &apos;m going to start by doing a little sterilizing it . 
This is really my flesh . It &apos;s not Damian &apos;s special farmed meat . 
This is my skin . This is not a special effect . Hollywood . 
I &apos;m going to put this needle in my skin and go through it and drive it until it &apos;s on the other side , leaving again . 
If you &apos;re getting bad , if you &apos;re easily fainting . I have this a couple of friends . Last night . In the hotel room . And some people I don &apos;t know and I &apos;m doing this is a woman almost fainthearted . 
I &apos;m suggesting , if you &apos;re quick to get sick , look for the next few 30 seconds away . Or ... You know what ? I &apos;m going to get the first delicate part back here . 
You can do it in a moment . Look , you can also look away . If you want , so it &apos;s 
so right here , where my meat starts . Down there , at the bottom of my arm , I &apos;m just going to make a little bit of 
a break . Do I really regret ? Do you crazy about that ? 
And now , just a little bit through my skin . And on the other side , again , 
out . Now we &apos;re actually in the same situation , which we &apos;re in with the knife trick . 
About , 
but now you can put my fingers out . Or ? 
So I &apos;m going to show you . This is one , two , three , four , five . 
Well , 
I know what people are thinking . If you see that , 
you say , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s probably not so stupid . &quot; And it &apos;s self @-@ stifling , just to give us a few minutes to entertain for us . 
Well , then I &apos;ll show you . 
What does this look like ? Very good . 
Yes . I know . And people in the back say , &quot; Okay . &quot; I have not really seen this . People 
in the adjoining rooms are now coming in , 
let it be me , let me tell you from near . 
This is really my skin . This is not a special effect . 
Hollywood . This is my flesh . And I can turn this around . 
Sorry . If you get sick , look away . Look not at it . 
People in the back , or those who eventually saw this sometime on video , will say , &quot; Well , yeah . &quot; This looks pretty right . Impressive . But if it were real , he would see you here . Here &apos;s a hole . And there , if it was really real , it would bleed . Okay . 
Let me just take a little blood for you . 
Squeeze out , yeah . Here it is . 
Normally I would now put out the needle . 
I would take my arm out and show you that there &apos;s no wounds there . 
But I think in this frame here and with the intention of trying to get something out of deception real , I &apos;m going to just take the needle in there . And so , from the stage , 
we &apos;re going to go in the next few days , a few more times . 
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . Thank you very much . 
So I &apos;ve got a lot of fish in my life . 
I &apos;ve only loved two . 
This first one , which was more like a passionate affair . 
It was a beautiful fish . It was tasty . Good consistency . Hold . A bestseller . On the menu . 
What a fish there 
is better . It got better in aquaculture , after the supposedly highest standards of sustainability . 
You could therefore imagine that you were growing it for sale . 
I had this beauty , a relationship over several months . 
One day , the boss of the company called and asked if I was growing up at an event about the highest sustainability of the farm . 
Of course , I said , 
&quot; Here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem for our chefs had become . How do we keep fish on our menus ? 
In the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the seas , how we &apos;ve been barking forests . 
It &apos;s hard to destroy , overstate 90 
percent of the big fish , who we &apos;re loving . The tuna , the curative butte , the salmon , the swordfish . They &apos;ve collapsed . 
It &apos;s almost nothing left . 
So I think it &apos;s aquaculture that &apos;s going to be bad or bad . Fish farming . Part of our future . 
Many arguments against it : Fish farming plants pollute the environment . Most of you . Anyway . And you &apos;re inefficient . Let &apos;s take tuna , a big disadvantage . 
It has feed recovery of 15 percent to one . 
That means : 15 pounds . Wild fish are necessary to get one pound of farmed tuna . 
Not very sustainable tastes 
, not very good either . 
So here was finally a company . It tried to get it right . 
I wanted to support them . 
The day before the event , I called the boss of public relations for the company , and I was going to call him . 
Let &apos;s call him . 
Don Don , I just said . To get the facts . Right ? To have you famous for that . So far out in the sea , you grow the environment so that you don &apos;t pollute . That 
&apos;s true , he said . &quot; We &apos;re so far out that the waste is from our fish distributed , not concentrated . And 
then he added . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re basically our own world . 
This feed recovery of 2.5 to 1 &quot; he said , 
&quot; The best in the industry . &quot; 
2.5 to one , great , 
2.5 to one , what what feeds ? Your 
sustainable proteins , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Great , &quot; I said , &quot; I got up , &quot; 
and that evening I lay in bed thinking , &quot; What the hell is a sustainable protein ? 
&quot; So I called the next day . Shortly before the Don event . 
I said , &quot; Don , what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot; 
He said he didn &apos;t know . He &apos;ll ask . 
Well , I telephoned with a couple of people in the company . Nobody could tell me a good answer . Until I finally got to the leading biologist , 
let &apos;s call him the same . 
Don Don said , &quot; What , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot; 
Well , he mentioned some algae . And some fishmeal . And then he said , chicken pellets . 
I said chicken pellets . He 
said , &quot; Yes . &quot; Feathers , skin . Bone flour . Remnants dried . And to feed processed . 
I said , &quot; How much percent of your food is chicken ? &quot; 
Assuming maybe two percent ? 
Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , he said . 
I said , &quot; Don , what &apos;s sustainable about chicken to feed fish ? There 
was a long break in the pipeline . And he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chicken on the planet . &quot; 
I fell in love with that fish . 
No . Not because I was a self @-@ righteous connoisseur and a good man . 
That &apos;s me . 
No . I &apos;m not really impressed by this fish because I swear I swear to God , &quot; The fish after this conversation , after having tasted chicken . 
&quot; This second fish . This is another species of love story . 
It &apos;s the romantic species , the species where you ever ever better love your fish , the better you get to know your fish , the more you love the fish . 
I have it first in a restaurant in southern Spain . 
A friend journalist had long been talking about this fish . She has 
kind of cuffed us . 
He came up on the table with a bright one . Almost shimmering . White one . 
Color . The cook had cooked it . 
Hold twice . 
Amazingly , he was still delicious . 
Who can buy a fish ? So good to taste after he cooked it . 
I can &apos;t . But this guy can call 
it , we call it Miguel . In fact , he &apos;s called Miguel , 
and no . He has the fish not cooked . And he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that you and I understand it . 
He &apos;s a biologist at Veta La Palma . 
This is a fish rearing in the southwest corner . Spain , 
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river Guadalquivir , right 
into the 1980s . The farm in the hands of Argentines . 
They grew meat cattle on what was basically wetlands , 
right ? They did this by making the country drainage . 
They built this complicated sequence of canals . And they pushed water out of the country and out . In the river . 
Well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not economically , 
and environmentally , it was a disaster . 
It brought about 90 percent of the birds around . What kind of place ? A lot of birds are . 
And so 1982 , a Spanish company with environmental awareness . The country bought . 
What did they do ? 
They bought the river of water back . 
They literally have the lever . 
Instead of pushing out the water , they used the channels to get the water back . Put it in . 
They flooded the channels . 
They created an 11,000 acres of fish farming , perch , sea ash , shrimp , eel . And in doing so , Miguel . And his company , the ecological destruction completely reversed . 
The farm is incredible . 
I mean , they have something like this never seen before . They &apos;re 
staring out onto the horizon , which is a million miles away . And everything they see is flooded . Channels . And this dense , lush march . 
I was there , not long ago , with Miguel . 
He &apos;s an incredible guy . Three parts . Charles Darwin . And one part , a crocodile for kissing . 
Okay . There we were and we fought through the wetlands . And I chash and sweat , I have mud up to my knees , and Miguel keeps calm . A biology lecture 
here , he lifts a rare track . 
Now he mentions mineral needs of phytoplankton . 
And here &apos;s where he sees a pattern of bundles that he &apos;s looking at the Tanzanian giraffe . Does 
it look like it turns out Miguel is the majority of his career in Mikumi National Park in Africa , where he spent the most of his career in Mikumi National Park ? 
I asked him how he was going to be a fish expert . 
He said , &quot; Fish , I don &apos;t know about fish . 
I &apos;m an expert in relationships . And 
then he goes and falls and falls into more talk of rare birds and algae and algae . And strange aquatic plants , 
and you don &apos;t get me wrong . &quot; That was really fascinating . You know , the biotic community , unplugged , like it was in the way 
it was great . But I was in love . 
And my head got weak about this cooked piece of delicious fish , which I found on the eve . 
So I got him interrupted . I said , Miguel . &quot; How is it that your fish is so good ? &quot; 
He pointed to algae . 
I know boy , algae of phytoplankton . The relationships This is incredible . 
But what do your fish eat ? 
What is the recycling of feed ? Well 
, he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that it &apos;s the fish that eat what they eat in the wild , 
The vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton . That &apos;s what the fish feed . 
The system is so healthy . It &apos;s completely self @-@ explanatory . 
There &apos;s no food . 
The way a farm owns its own animals is that it doesn &apos;t feed , and 
later on the day I drove . This is a lot around Miguel . And I asked him . I said , &quot; For a place that &apos;s so natural , it seems different from any farm on which I ever have been . How do you measure success ? &quot; 
The moment it was like a film director was changing stage , and it was like a film director was asking for a change of stage . 
And we bowed around the corner and us offered ourselves the opportunity to see the most incredible thing . Thousands and thousands of pinkers , flamingos , literally pinker carpet . So far as the eye can see , 
that &apos;s success . He said , 
&quot; Look at their bellies . &quot; Pink . 
They &apos;re smuggling , slugging 
. I was completely confused . 
I said , Miguel , don &apos;t smuggle your fish . Yes 
, he said . 
&quot; We &apos;re losing 20 percent of our fish . And fish eggs to birds . 
&quot; Well , last year , on this plot , 600,000 birds were more than 250 different species . 
It &apos;s today the largest . And one of the most important private bird reserves in Europe . 
I said , &quot; Miguel is a well @-@ thriving bird population , not . The last thing you can do on a fish farm . &quot; 
He shook his head . No . 
He said , &quot; We &apos;re building extensively , not intensively . 
This is a green network . 
The flamingos eat the shrimps , 
the shrimps eat the phytoplankton , 
the pinker . &quot; So the belly , the better . The system . Okay 
. Let &apos;s do a rethink . A farm that has no feeding its animals . And a farm that has been successful in health at the predators &apos; health . 
A fish rearing , but also a bird reserve . 
Oh , and by the way , these flamingos shouldn &apos;t even be there from the outset . 
They breed in a city 240 kilometers away , where the soil quality is better . For nest maintenance 
every morning , they fly 240 kilometers to the farm . 
And every night they fly . They fly 240 kilometers back . 
They do that because they &apos;re going to follow the dotted white line of the A92 highway . 
Seriously . 
I had a kind of journey that penguins had imagined . So I looked at Miguel . 
I said Miguel . &quot; Fly them . 240 kilometers to go . &quot; &quot; The farm and fly them then . &quot; 240 kilometers back . In the 
evening , they do that for the kids . He 
looked at me as if I had just heard a song from Whitney Houston . 
He said , &quot; No . &quot; &quot; They do that . &quot; Because the food is better . 
I don &apos;t have the skin of my beloved fish mentioned . The food was delicious , and I don &apos;t like the skin of fish . I like it , not sucked . I like it , not crispy . 
It &apos;s this biting , charcoal taste . 
I cook almost never with it . And 
yet , when I put it in this restaurant in southern Spain , she even did not want to taste fish skin . 
She tasted sweet and pure as if you were eating a bite from the ocean . 
I mentioned that to Miguel . And he nodded . 
He said , &quot; The skin looks like a sponge . 
It &apos;s the last defense before anything happens in the body . 
&quot; She &apos;s got herself in evolution . She &apos;s evolved to suck up impurities . And 
then he added , &quot; But our water doesn &apos;t have impurities . Okay 
. A farm that has no fish feeding . A farm that has measured its success in the success of its predators . 
And then I realized , if it says , &quot; A farm that doesn &apos;t have impurities , it undermines enormously . &quot; Because the water that goes through this farm comes from the farm from the Guadalquivir River . 
It &apos;s a river that &apos;s all the things with it . It &apos;s a river that &apos;s now running with all the things that rivers tend to do with them . Chemical pollutants , pesticide outflow . 
And if it goes through the system , it &apos;s fought , and it leaves , the water is cleaner than it came in . 
The system is so healthy . It cleans the water . 
So not only a farm that &apos;s cleaning its animals . Not only a farm that &apos;s successful in feeding its animals . Not only a farm that measures its success in the health of its predators , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water treatment plant . And not only for these fish , but also for you . And me . 
Because if the water flows out , it sinks into the Atlantic , 
a drop in the ocean . I know . But I take it . And that &apos;s what you should do . Because this love story , however romantic , is also instructive . 
You might say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future , good food . Whether we &apos;re eating beef or meat cattle , 
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , of a farm in which food is . In fact , taste good . 
But for many people , this is a little too radical . 
We &apos;re not realists . We enjoy . We &apos;re lovers . 
We love weekly markets . We love little ones . Family farms . We talk about regional food . We eat . Bio . 
And if you claim that &apos;s the stuff that &apos;s the future of good food insurance , it stands . Someone somewhere up and says , &quot; Hey guys , I love pink flamingos . &quot; But how are you going to feed the world ? How 
are you going to feed the world ? 
Can I be honest . 
I like this question . Not . 
No . Not . Because we already have enough calories to produce the world more than just to feed . 
One billion people today will starve . 
One billion . That &apos;s more than ever before . Because of stark inequalities in distribution , not total production . 
Well , I like this question not because it &apos;s the logic of our food system , the last 50 years of it . 
Feed grain to vegetable eaters , pesticides to monocultures , chemicals to the Earth , chicken to fish , and all the time , the agricultural industry has just asked . If we have more people feeding cheaper , how horrible can that be ? That 
was the reason . It was the justification . It was the business plan of American agriculture . 
We should call it what it is . It was a liquidation business , a business that quickly picked up ecological capital , which is what enables that very production . 
That &apos;s not a business . And it &apos;s not agriculture . 
Our grain chamber is threatened today , not because of decreasing supply , but because of decreasing resources . 
Not because of the latest Moravian and Tractor inventions , but because of fertile land . Not because of pumps , but because of fresh water , not by chainsaws , but because of forests . And not by fishing boats . And nets , but by fish in the sea . They 
want the world to feed . Let 
&apos;s start with the question of this . How are we going to feed ourselves , 
or better ? How can we create conditions that would create conditions that would enable each community to feed itself 
to do this ? Look , don &apos;t look at the agricultural industrial model for the future . 
It &apos;s really old . And it &apos;s done . 
Capital , chemistry and machines are on top of it . And it never has anything really good to eat . 
Let &apos;s look instead at the ecological model . 
This is that that on two billion years of work experience . 
Look at Miguel . Farmers like Miguel , 
farms that don &apos;t have worlds for themselves . Farmers that restore . Instead of using up farms that grow extensively . Instead of just intensive farmers , who not only are producers , but experts in relationships . 
Because they are the ones who are experts on taste . 
And if I really am honest , they are a better cook . When I ever be , 
you know , you know , that &apos;s right . Because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious . 
His thanks . 
I grew up with a lot of science fiction , 
in my school days , I drove with the bus to school , every day , an hour per way . And my 
nose was always in a book , a science fiction book . That was my thoughts into other worlds , and narratives that took me . My deep inside me , insatiable curiosity satisfied these curiosity 
, showed up in it , too , that whenever I was not in the school , I was always , through the woods , wandering and sampling , gathering frogs and snakes and beetles . And pond water , bringing everything home . And under the microscope , 
I looked at it , I was totally enthusiastic about science . 
You know , it always was about the attempt to get the world to understand . And the limits of what is possible , 
and my love of science . Fiction seemed to be around me reflecting . Because back then , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea , 
Jacques Cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows that brought us animals and places and a world full of wonders that we never had before imagined . 
This then probably has been very good for that science fiction role . 
And I was an artist . 
I could draw . I could paint . 
And since it &apos;s not video games , nor this saturation , with computer @-@ generated films , nor the whole visual language . In the media landscape , I had to give the images in my head . 
That &apos;s what we all had to do at the time . If we were kids , we read a book , we took the author &apos;s description and projected it onto the canvas . In our minds 
, my reaction was that drawing and painting was about aliens aliens &apos; alien worlds , robots , spacecraft . And all of that . 
In math class , I was constantly caught by the teacher . 
How I was hiding around in the textbook , the creativity had to sort of get out of it , 
and it was happening . Something interesting that actually struck me about Jacques Cousteaus &apos; shows was . The idea of a totally unknown idea of a world here on our planet . 
Even certainly , I would never have an alien world with a spaceship , I would never reach . That seemed pretty unlikely to me . 
But here was a world I was actually entering . Here on Earth , and it was just as fascinating and exotic as all of what was I thought I &apos;d ever imagined . When I was reading these books , 
so I decided when I was 15 , I was going to become a diver . 
The only problem with this was that I was in a small village in Canada , one thousand kilometers from the nearest ocean , 
and I was living in a small village . And 
I was left with no discouragement . I was annoying my father until he finally got a diving school in Buffalo , New York , and he was finding it . And that &apos;s exactly the other side of the border where we lived . 
I made my diving certificate in a pool called YMCA , right in winter in Buffalo , New York . 
The ocean , but a real ocean , I got only two years later to see . When we went to California , 
since then , in the 40 years that have passed , I &apos;ve got about 3,000 hours under water , and I &apos;ve been living there for about three thousand hours . 500 hours of that in submersible boats . 
And I &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea itself is in the flatter oceans so rich in fascinating life , even in the flatter oceans . How we feel it really hard to imagine , the imagination of 
nature knows . No limits . All the opposite to our own miserable human imagination . 
Until now , it &apos;s been my deepest awe for what I feel about my dives . 
And my love of the ocean continues with the same intensity as ever . And ever as I 
got to be an adult , I chose a profession , it was filmmaking . 
That seemed the best way to make my inner urge to tell stories . With my need to create images , 
to unite when I was a kid , I kept drawing comic books . And so 
, films were the way , pictures and stories were brought together . That fit together . 
Of course , the stories I was choosing were from the science fiction field : Terminator , Aliens and Abyss . At 
Abyss , I could have my preference for the underwater world . And diving with the filmmaking link to that . 
So the things that I did are my two passions intertwined , 
something interesting happened . At Abyss , to solve a narrative problem in this movie , And that was , we had to do something like create a liquid water system . Let &apos;s take a look at computer @-@ generated animation . CG : 
What came out of this was the first computer @-@ generated soft surface figure ever to be seen in a movie . 
The film did not bring money , though . In fact , it just played its production costs . But I noticed something fascinating . The audience on the planet was a bit hypnotized . The magic of the one that was 
thought to be Arthur Clarke &apos;s law , as you know , advanced technology and magic are no longer to be distinguished from each other . 
They saw something magical . 
And that &apos;s what I found incredibly exciting . 
And I thought , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s absolutely what film art has to be involved in . So 
we went to Terminator 2 , my next movie , a lot further . 
Together with ILM , we created the guy there from liquid metal , the success was hanging . It was quite that . How this effect 
comes about ? And it worked . Again , we had created something magical . And the effect in the audience was the same . But we did have the 
film already , a little bit more money . Recorded by these two experiences , we had a whole new world reached . A whole new world of creativity for filmmakers . 
So I started a company with me and my good friend Stan . Winston , who was at that time the best make @-@ up and creature designer . She was called Digital Domain . 
The basic idea of this company was to start the phase of analog processes with optical printers , etc . , and just jump over to digital productions . 
And we did that , and we managed to do it . For a while , 
we had a competitive advantage . But in the mid @-@ 1990s , we realized that we were in the Creature and Character Design , for which we actually founded the company . Too slowly . 
I had this piece , Avatar , written that the bar on visual effects and computer @-@ generated effects across new lines , pushing the bar up . With realistic , human expressive characters that are made using CG , And the main characters were supposed to be all CG . And the world was supposed to be CG . 
But the bar pressed pretty much back . And people in my company said , &quot; Well , for the time being , we haven &apos;t been able to do that . 
So I shifted that , and I did this other movie about the big ship . 
&quot; That goes to the studio , I have that as Romeo and Juliet on a ship , sold it . It became a love movie of epic proportions , a passionate movie , secret 
. But did I actually want to become a real wreck ? The Titanic : Dive 
down . That &apos;s why I made the film . 
That &apos;s the truth . The studio knew that , but not . 
I got it convinced , though , by saying , &quot; We dive to the wreck . &quot; We film the real wreck . 
We &apos;ll do it in the opening sequence of the film . 
That &apos;s incredibly important . It &apos;s a good trailer for marketing . And 
I persuaded you to make an expedition finance . 
Sounds crazy . But that &apos;s going to be back to the fact that your imagination creates a reality . 
We then actually created six months later a reality in which we created a reality in which I was found in a Russian submersible , four kilometers below the surface of the North Atlantic . And to me , the real Titanic through a bullet . This was 
not a movie . No HD . This was real . 
So this has really bypassed me . 
And the preparations for this were enormous . We had to have cameras and headlights and everything . 
And I fell on how much these deep @-@ sea dive gears resembled a space mission . 
Well , they were also high @-@ tech and needed more . Planning : 
You go into this capsule . Then you float into this dark , hostile environment , where no hope for salvation exists , you float down . If you don &apos;t return it yourself 
and I thought to myself , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s the same as if I were in a science fiction movie . 
&quot; That &apos;s really cool . I 
was really obsessed . I was obsessed with exploring the deep sea , at least the part 
that was related to curiosity and science . It was all . It was adventure . It was curiosity . It was imagination . 
And it was an experience that I had not had Hollywood to give me . 
Because , you know , I could be imagined as a creature for which we would then have a visual effect . But I could not imagine that . What I could imagine outside the window was 
what I would see . Some of the expeditions that followed , I &apos;ve seen beings in thermal springs . And sometimes things that I &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that I &apos;ve seen before , sometimes things that nobody had ever seen before . And for those who have been science at the time we saw them . Even no words 
found at all . That &apos;s what really turned me around . And I wanted more . 
And so I met a little bit unusual decision . 
After success of Titanic , I said to myself , &quot; Okay , I want to be a filmmaker in Hollywood , and I &apos;m going to be on ice for a while , full @-@ time researchers . And 
then we started these expeditions to plan . 
We showed up to Bismarck and we explored them with robotic vehicles . 
We went back to the wreck of the Titanic . 
We took small robots that we built that we had a fiber optic cable . 
Our intention was to dive in and get inside the ship and look at the inside of it . What never before has been done . 
Nobody had ever had the inside of the wreck explored . You had not had the tools to do that . So we developed the technology we needed . 
So , what ? There I am now sitting on the deck . The Titanic . In a submersible boat , and I see planks planking these boards quite similar here . And of those I know once that the band there was playing 
, And I &apos;m flying with a little robot vehicle through the aisles of the ship . 
I &apos;m operating it , actually . But my consciousness is within the vehicle . 
It felt like it was me playing physically inside the ship wreck , the Titanic . 
That was the surreal form of a déjà vu that I &apos;ve ever experienced . Because before I was asked to go around a corner , I always knew what was going to happen in the light cone of the vehicle . Because I &apos;ve been running over the movie set for months when we shot the film . 
The set was actually a copy of the blueprints of the ship . 
This was a very strange experience , 
then . It made me this telepresence experience realize that you could have such robotic avatars . And so , your consciousness into that vehicle . In that other form of existence , 
it can be moved . It was really incredibly profound . 
And maybe it was also a little bit of a view of what might happen in a few decades . If you have cyborg bodies to do some research or other things to do . In all sorts of post @-@ human future scenarios that I think I can imagine as a science fiction fan . 
After these expeditions , we started what we were down there seeing , and we started to see what we had seen . We really appreciated learning . For example , these deep @-@ sea equals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . These are , like , aliens . But here on Earth . 
They live with the help of chemosynthesis . 
They don &apos;t exist in sunlight . They exist in a system based on sunlight . As we do . 
And this is how you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees Celsius . Hot water cloud live . And 
you can &apos;t imagine that there are animals that can survive . 
At the same time , I was also very interested in space science . This was again the science fiction influence . From my childhood 
and so I ended up with people who were struggling for the space world . And those who were interested in NASA have to do with NASA , and they &apos;re in NASA &apos;s expert council planning real space missions . They &apos;re going to Russia , going through before the mission . The biomedical protocol , and everything that goes on flying around . Then to the International Space Station , and take our 3D camera systems with them . 
This was fascinating . 
But at the end of the day , it was that I was going to be a space scientist with us in the deep sea . 
I took them with me and I was going to give them access to the world . Down there , astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were in the interest of such extreme situations . I took them to the sources with me so that they could look around , take samples and test instruments . And so on . 
We turned . We did documentary films . But actually science , more specifically space science , 
so the circle between my existence as a science fiction fan closed . Back then , when I was a kid and I was a reality . 
Over the course of this discovery journey , I learned a lot . 
I learned a lot about science , a lot . But I also learned a lot about leadership . 
Now , you probably think a director must also be able to lead . A leader like a ship captain or something . 
I understood , but not much about leadership . Before I started these expeditions , 
because I was at a certain point , I had to tell myself , what am I doing ? Here . 
Why am I doing this ? What &apos;s coming out of this ? These 
stupid movies bring us no money . We &apos;ll just play 
the production costs . One of fame , no trace . 
Everybody thinks I &apos;m between Titanic and Avatar . Walked away and would have somewhere nails on a towel on a beach , cheered me off . 
I &apos;ve all these movies , these documentary films , for a very small audience . 
No fame , no honor . No money . What are you doing ? 
You &apos;re doing it to do it for the sake of the task , for the sake of the challenge . And the ocean is the most challenging environment that exists . You &apos;re doing it for the discovery . And because of the strange connection that emerges when a small group of people , a team , forms . 
Because we have all of this with just 10 to 12 people , who have been doing continuous cooperation for years . Sometimes we were two to three months in a row at sea . 
And in this community , you can see that the most important thing is respect , the respect that you have for each other , because you &apos;ve done a job that you can &apos;t explain to anyone else . 
If you &apos;re going back to land and you say , &quot; We had to do it . &quot; The fiberglass , the sound attenuation . And that &apos;s all around . The whole technology . And the difficulties , the human performance . If you &apos;re working at sea , you can do that to the other person . That &apos;s like policemen or policemen , or soldiers who have something in common . And they know they never have somebody explaining it . 
And there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect . 
When I came back to my next movie , Avatar , to try to make the same leadership style , which is that you respect your team and you &apos;re in return for the respect that they deserve . 
And that made the dynamics really 
change . And I stood there again with a little team , unknown . And we turned Avatar with a new technology that it used to be , and it didn &apos;t exist before . 
It was incredibly exciting . 
It was a tremendous challenge . 
And we became a huge challenge for a period of four and a half years , a real family . 
And that changed my way of making films . 
It changed completely . There were people who thought we had these ocean properties . Yes . Really ? Good . Tone . And then on the planet . Pandora transports for 
me , it was more a principled way to do my job . The actual process , which results from this change . 
What can we do from all of this ? 
What lessons do we learn ? 
I believe in the first place is curiosity . 
It &apos;s the most powerful human property . Our 
imagination is a force that even has a reality to create . 
And respect for your team is more important than all laurels . This world to 
me comes from young filmmakers . They say , &quot; Give me a advice . &quot; How do I do this ? And 
I say , &quot; Don &apos;t limit you . &quot; Even 
one that already concerns others for you . Do not do it . Do it yourself . Don &apos;t bet against yourself , but take risks , take risks . 
NASA has this kind of favorite sentence . Failure is not an alternative . But 
in art and in exploration , it has to fail . An alternative . Because there it guarantees a trust advance . 
No important undertaking . Innovation demanded has ever been approached without risk . 
You have to be ready . Such risks have 
to be taken . That &apos;s the idea I &apos;m going to share with you on the way . Failure is a very alternative . Fear . But isn &apos;t it ? Thank you . 
If I can give you a little bit of a little bit of a closer today , it &apos;s that the whole data we consume is larger than the sum of your pieces . And instead of overloading information , instead of thinking about overloading information , I want you to think about how we are information . So , use it to create patterns . And we &apos;re seeing trends that otherwise don &apos;t become visible . 
So what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical death chart , arranged by age . 
The program I &apos;m using here is a little experiment . 
It &apos;s called Pivot . And what I &apos;m doing with Pivot is that I &apos;m going to be able to filter for a certain cause of death . Let &apos;s say accidents . 
And immediately I see another pattern , which is going to emerge 
, because in the middle area here , people are the most active . And you over here , they &apos;re the most frail . 
We can take a step further out and sort out the data . Then , new and see that circulatory diseases and cancer , the usual suspects , are . But not for everybody . 
If we go further and age @-@ sort them , we say 40 years or younger . Let &apos;s see that accidents are even the main cause . About those that people worry about , people should worry about , 
and who &apos;s researching , see that this is particularly true for men . 
You can see , then , that the image of information and data in this way is very much swimming . In a vivid graphic of information . 
And if we think about raw data , why not ? Why not content itself ? 
What we &apos;re having here is the cover images of each and every sport Illustrated , which have ever been printed . 
It &apos;s all here . It &apos;s all online . 
You can like to do it after I gave my talk in your rooms . 
With Pivot , you can immerse yourself in a decade . 
You can immerse yourself in a given year . 
You can dive directly to a particular issue . 
If I &apos;m looking here , I see the athletes who are in this issue and appearing in sports . 
I &apos;m a Lance Armstrong fan . So I click here to see what all the issues show me in which Lance Armstrong mentions Lance Armstrong . 
Now , if I just have a bigger overview , I could . I think , OK , what ? If I could do everything about the subject of cycling , 
so I &apos;m going to take a step back and expand the perspective . 
Now I &apos;m looking at Greg Lemon . 
And so you get an idea of the idea that if you look at this kind of information , you zoom in more targeted , wider , more pure . Then you don &apos;t look for or surf . Not just . 
You do something that is actually a little different . 
It &apos;s something in between . And we think it changes the way that you do information . 
I want to use this idea a little bit further . It &apos;s something like , what &apos;s a little crazy , 
what we &apos;ve done here . We have every single wikipedia page taken , and we &apos;ve taken it to a little summary . 
The summary contains a quick overview and a symbol of the image area from which you can come . 
I &apos;m just going to show you . The top 500 of the most popular wikipedia pages . 
But even in this narrow view , we can see a lot of things . 
Immediately , we get an idea of the issues that Wikipedia is about to get the most popular . 
I &apos;m going to talk about government now . 
Now , after I &apos;ve elected government , I realize that the Wikipedia categories that are most concerned with this are Time Magazines , people of the year . 
This is really important . Because this is a realization that is not in a single Wikipedia page . 
This is just to be seen . If you take a step back , and look at the whole thing , 
looking at one of these summaries , can I then go into the subject of Time Magazines , &quot; People of the Year , &quot; and see everybody together ? 
If I now look at all these people , I realize that the majority of them are government officials . Some of them come from science . Some of them come from economics , even less . Here &apos;s my boss . And one comes from music . 
And interestingly , Bono is also a TED Prize winner . 
So we can jump and win a look at everybody TED Prize . 
Take a look at the web , and you see we surf . The first time it &apos;s like it &apos;s really a web network . Not only from side to side , but it &apos;s much more abstract . 
And so I want to show you something else that a little surprise might be . 
I &apos;m going to just show you the New York Times website . 
Pivot . This application . I want it not to be a browser . Call it really not a browser . But you can use it to look at websites . And we bring this zoom technology to every single website like this . 
I can , therefore , go back a step and go straight to a specific section . 
This is important because you only need to go through looking at websites in this way , and you can do all the Internet history in the same way , 
looking at the web . I can , therefore , zoom in into 
my course , in a certain time frame . Here &apos;s the state of play of the entire demonstration that I &apos;ve kept going up to now . 
And I can sort of do everything I &apos;ve seen so far . I can get back . 
And if I get back a step and get back on everything , I can get back to rearrange my course , maybe after my search past . Here I am , looking for nepotistic . Here &apos;s Bing , right ? Here &apos;s live Labs Pivot . 
And from here , I can go to the page . And you can go back to 
it . It &apos;s a metaphor that keeps coming up and being used . And every time it does the overall picture , it &apos;s bigger than the sum of the data pieces . 
Right now , in this world , we think that data is a curse . 
We &apos;re talking about the curse of the abundance of information . 
We &apos;re talking about drowning in information . 
What if we could turn this situation around ? And the Internet on its head , turning it on its head so that instead of always moving from one to the other , we start . Many things to many things go on to many things . And by doing that , we can see patterns that would otherwise have been hidden . 
If we do this , then it will be this data trap that we &apos;ve seen so far , maybe a new source of meaningful information . 
And instead of just just getting information about it , we can know from it . 
And if we know , then we can maybe even learn wisdom . And we learn 
from that . I stop . Thank you very much . 
Everybody &apos;s talking today about happiness . 
I have some people , the number of books , counting the number of books that are entitled &quot; Happiness &quot; in the title , published over the last five years . And they gave , after about 40 . And there were still a lot more . 
There &apos;s a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers . 
There &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching . 
Everybody would like to make people happier . 
But despite all this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps that make it kind of impossible , so to speak . Sure . About thinking about happiness 
and my talk . Today , it &apos;s mostly these cognitive traps that will act . 
That &apos;s true for laymen who are talking about their own happiness . And it &apos;s true for scientists who are thinking about happiness because it turns out we &apos;re just as confused as we are with everybody else . 
The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity . 
It turns out that this word is happiness , just not a useful word anymore . Because we put it on too many different things . 
I think there &apos;s a certain meaning to which we apply it , and we could limit it . But in the end , this is something that we give up on , by and large . And we will take the complicated view , and we will have to take it on board . What well @-@ being is . 
The second case is confusion between what experience and memory is . Basically , it &apos;s between happiness , being happy . In his life and being happy about his life or being happy with his life . 
And these are two very different concepts . And they &apos;re both thrown together . In the idea of happiness 
and happiness , the third is the concentration illusion . And that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we &apos;re not talking about a circumstance that we can think about . Well @-@ being affects without affecting its meaning . 
I mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive trap . 
There &apos;s just no way . It &apos;s right to get it right . 
Now I &apos;d like to take an example from someone who has a question and answer session . After one of my lectures , which covered a story , it was unclear . He said he had a symphony heard . And it was absolutely wonderful music . And quite at the end of the recording , there was a terrible , creeping sound . 
And then he added , &quot; Really , quite emotional . &quot; That &apos;s got all the experience ruined . 
But that was not 
what it had ruined . The memories of the experience were . 
He had the experience . 
He had 20 minutes of wonderful music . 
They didn &apos;t count because he had a memory that he had stayed with . The memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he was to keep to 
, the memory . What that really tells us is that we &apos;re talking about ourselves and about other people , and we could think about ourselves . In the sense of two kinds of self . 
There &apos;s an enlivening self that is in the present . And the present knows how capable it is of rebuilding the past . But basically , only the present has 
it , it &apos;s the living self that the doctor prides . You know , if the doctor asks , &quot; Is it hurting now ? &quot; If I can touch you here 
and then there &apos;s a memory self . And the memory self is that , which mixes . And the story of our life keeps up . And it &apos;s the one that the doctor addresses by touching the question by asking the question . How did you feel in recent times ? Or 
what was your journey to Albania ? Or something like that ? 
These are two very different units . The living self . And the remembering self . And the two to be confused is part of the way the term &quot; happiness &quot; is cohesive . 
Now , the remembering self is a storyteller . 
And that really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memories . It starts immediately . 
We don &apos;t just tell stories . If we remember it , we tell stories , 
our memory tells us stories . That means what we &apos;re talking about , what we &apos;re allowed to keep from our experiences , is a story . 
And let &apos;s not let you take an example . 
There &apos;s an old study . 
These are real patients who are one of the painful procedures . 
I &apos;m not going to go into detail . It &apos;s not anymore painful today . But it was painful when this study was conducted in the 1990s . 
They were asked to do it every 60 seconds for their pain to be reported . And 
here are two patients . These are their records . 
And they &apos;re asked , who of both has suffered more ? And 
that &apos;s a very simple question . 
Patient B clearly has suffered more . His intestinal reflection was longer . And every minute of pain , the patient A had patient A , patient B and more . 
But now there &apos;s another question : How much did these people think that they suffered from it ? And 
here &apos;s a surprise . And 
the surprise is that patient A has a much worse memory of patient A. than patient A. has had patient B. 
The stories of intestinal reflections were different . And because a very critical part of the story is how you end . 
And none of these stories is very edible or great . But one of them is this : Clear . But one of them is clearly worse than the other . 
And those who are worse were the ones where the pain was all at the end of its peak . It &apos;s a bad story . 
How do we know that ? 
Because we &apos;re going to look at these people for their gut reflection , and much later on , how bad was it . All the whole thing . And 
it was much worse for A than for B in B in memory . 
Well , this is a direct conflict between the living self and the remembering . Even 
from the perspective of the living self , B clearly had a worse time . 
Now , what you do with patient A ? And we actually have clinical experiments . And it &apos;s been done . And it works . You could actually do the intestinal reflection of patient A by extending just the tube in it by leaving it . Without too much on it to shake . 
That &apos;s going to make the patient suffer , but only one little bit and much less than before . 
And if you do that for a few minutes , you have done it to make the living self of patient A worse off than that . And you &apos;ve made it to make the memory self of patient A much better off with it . Because now you have patient A , a better story about your experience , given you . 
What makes a story look like ? 
And that &apos;s true of the stories that memory tells us . And it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent , which 
makes a story unique . Changes , significant moments and ends 
are very , very important . And in this case , the end dominated . 
Now , the living self lives his life continuously . 
It has moments of experience , one after the other . 
And you ask , what happens to these moments ? 
And the answer is really simple . They &apos;re forever lost . 
I mean , most moments of our lives . And I have calculated this . You know , the psychological presence is considered to be about three seconds long . What does &quot; you know &quot; mean that in a life it &apos;s about 600 million of them . In a month , there &apos;s about 600,000 . Most of you leave no trace of this . 
Most of you will be completely ignored by the memory self . 
And yet , somehow you get the impression that you should count , that what &apos;s going to happen during these moments of experience . Our life is , 
it &apos;s the limited resource that we consume . While we &apos;re in this world , 
and how we consume it , it would seem important . But that &apos;s not the story that this memory self is telling us for us . 
So we have the memory self . And the living self . And they &apos;re really quite different . 
The biggest difference between them is the way they deal with time 
from the perspective of the living . Even if they &apos;re on vacation and they &apos;re on vacation for the second week as good as the first . Then there &apos;s the two @-@ week vacation twice as good as the one @-@ week holiday . 
That &apos;s how it doesn &apos;t work at all . That &apos;s not how it works for the memory self , 
for the memory self , a two @-@ week holiday . It &apos;s hardly better than a one @-@ week holiday . Because there &apos;s no new memories added . 
You have the story not changed . 
And to do that , time is actually the critical variable , which is a different thing from a living self , time has . Very little influence on this story . 
Now , the memory self does more than remember and stories . 
It &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions . Because if you &apos;re a patient who says , &quot; We have two intestinal reflections at two different . &quot; Surgeons had , and decide , which one to choose . Then there &apos;s the one who chooses the one who has the memory , which is less bad . And that &apos;s the surgeon who chooses to be selected . 
The living self doesn &apos;t have a voice . In that choice , actually , 
we don &apos;t choose between experiences . We choose between memories of experiences 
and even experiences . If we think about the future , we think about our future . Normally not as experiences . 
We think about our future as our expected memories . 
And basically , they can look at that . You know , as a tyranny of the memory self . And you can think about the memory self . As one , which is the living self , so to speak , tugging through experiences that the living self doesn &apos;t need . 
I have the impression that if we leave , that &apos;s very common , it &apos;s the case , that is , . We make holidays , as much as possible , in the service of the memory self . 
And that &apos;s a little hard to justify , I think . 
I mean , how much do we feed from our memories ? 
That &apos;s one of the explanations that &apos;s been given for the dominance of the memory self . 
And when I think about that , I think about a vacation that we &apos;re going to spend a few years ago in Antarctica , which is clearly the best vacation we &apos;ve ever had . And I think relatively often about it relative to how often I have to think about other vacations . 
And I probably heard about my memories of these three @-@ week trips . I would say about 25 minutes for about 25 minutes in the last four years . 
Now , if I ever opened the folder with the 600 folders , with the 600 images in it , I would have spent another hour . 
Now , that &apos;s three weeks . And that &apos;s at most one and a half hours . 
There it seems to be some disagreement . 
Well , I like a little bit extreme . You know , in it , how little appetite I have for feeding memories ? But even if you have more of it , there &apos;s a real question . Why do we give memories so much weight ? In the scourge to the weight we experience , So 
I want you to talk about a thought experiment . 
Imagine if you &apos;re going to spend your next vacation . You know that in the end of your vacation , all your pictures are destroyed . And you get an amnesty drug like this , so you get nothing to remember . 
Now , you would have to choose the same vacation . And if you had another vacation , you would have a different conflict between your two two species of self . And you have to think about how you &apos;re going to decide this conflict . And that &apos;s really not obvious at all . Because if you &apos;re going to be thinking about time , you get an answer . And if you &apos;re thinking about memories , you could have a different answer , you could get a different one . 
Why we &apos;re going to choose the vacations that we choose ? One problem that we face with is a choice between the choices made between the two types of self . 
Well , the two kinds of self throw two terms of happiness into two . 
There are actually two concepts of happiness : The ones that we can apply . One per self . 
You can ask , how happy is that living self ? 
And then you would ask , how happy are the moments in life of the living being ? Even , 
and you &apos;re all lucky for moments . Is it a fairly complicated process ? 
What are the emotions ? They are what can be measured . 
And by the way , we are now able to have a pretty good idea . Of the happiness of the living self over time , 
when they &apos;re lucky after the happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a very different thing . 
This is not about how happy . A person lives . 
It &apos;s about how satisfied or happy . The person is when that person is informed about his or her life , 
very different terms . 
Anyone who thinks these terms are different will be studying happiness , masking . And I &apos;m one of a lot of researchers about well @-@ being , who is studying happiness , long masking . It &apos;s exactly . That &apos;s the way that 
the distinction between the happiness of the living self and the happiness of the remembering self is . In the last few years , it &apos;s been recognized , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separately . 
The Gallup Organization has a global survey of the number of people in the world , where more than half a million people have been asked questions . What they &apos;re asking about their lives and their lives and their experiences . And there were other efforts in the direction . 
In the last few years , we &apos;ve started to think about the happiness of the two kinds of self . 
And the main lesson we think we have learned , I think , is that they really are different . 
You can know how satisfied someone is with his life . And that &apos;s what she really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happy he lives his life . And vice versa . 
Just to give you an idea of the correlation between the correlation and the correlation . About five percent of 
what that means is that if you meet someone and you would meet them , you would tell them , &quot; Oh , his father is a two @-@ meter man . How much ? &quot; Would you know about his size ? 
Well , you would know something about his size . But there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty . 
You have so much uncertainty . 
If I tell you that somebody is going to live his life as eight on a scale of 10 . Do you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy ? He &apos;s with his survivor . 
Even the correlation is small . 
We know something about what happiness is about happiness self . 
We know that money is very important . Goals are very important . 
We know happiness is essentially content , content is content with people who we like , time to spend . With people we like , 
there are others that enjoy . But that &apos;s dominant . 
If you do happiness , then , for the two kinds of self to maximize . Will you end up with very different things ? 
The conclusion from what I &apos;m here saying is that what I said is that we really don &apos;t want happiness to imagine as a substitute for well @-@ being . 
It &apos;s a completely different term . 
Now , very briefly . Another reason for that is that we don &apos;t know how to think about happiness is that we don &apos;t think about the same things . If we think about life and think about life , and if we actually live 
, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California , they will not be the correct answer . 
If you ask that question , think that the people in California are happier than they are . If you say , &quot; We live in Ohio , 
and what happens is if you talk about life in California , if you think about life in California , think about the difference between California and other places . &quot; And that difference is , say , climate . 
Well , it turns out climate is not very important for climate to the living self . And it &apos;s not even very important for the thoughtful . Even that decides how happy people are . 
Well . But because the thoughtful self is responsible , you can end up with some people . At the end , they can move to California , 
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track . What happens to people who go to California ? In the hope of getting happier ? 
Well , their living self becomes . Not getting happier . 
We know . 
But one thing will happen . They will think they &apos;re happier . Because if you think about it , you &apos;re going to be reminded of how terrible the weather in Ohio was . And you &apos;ll feel you &apos;re going to make the right decision . 
It &apos;s very difficult to tell clearly about well @-@ being . And I hope I &apos;ve got you an idea of how well @-@ being is . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question for you . 
Thank you very much . 
Well , when we started thinking about phone a few weeks ago , you told me that it was a pretty interesting result that came out of this Gallup survey , 
and if that &apos;s something that you &apos;re going to be able to share with us . Because you &apos;re now going to have a few minutes left . 
Daniel Kahneman : Sure . 
I think the most interesting result we have in the Gallup survey is the one we found in the Gallup survey , a number that we absolutely didn &apos;t expect to find . 
We found that in terms of the happiness of the survivor himself . 
If we looked at how feelings with the income vary 
and how it represents , it turns out that under an income of 60 000 dollars , in the year , Americans . And that &apos;s a very big sample of Americans . About 600 000 . But it &apos;s a big representative sample under a income of about 600 000 dollars in the year . 
About 60 000 . 
DK : 60 000 
, 60 000 dollars a year , people are unhappy . And they &apos;re getting increasingly unhappy . The poorer they get about 
it , we get an absolutely flat line . 
I mean , I rarely have such flat lines 
seen . What &apos;s happening is obviously that money doesn &apos;t get you experience happiness . But that lack of money certainly gives you misery and we get , and we can get this misery very , very clear . 
In the sense of the other , even the remembering self , you get a different story . 
The more money you make , the more satisfied you are . 
That &apos;s not true of emotions . 
CA : But Danny , throughout America &apos;s endeavor , it &apos;s about life . Freedom , the endeavor for happiness . 
When people find this finding seriously , I would mean it seems like it all looks upside down . Everything we believe to be , for example , in tax policy . And so on . 
There &apos;s an opportunity that politicians , that the country in general , has a finding like taking seriously . And based on that , politics would do 
DK . You know ? I think it &apos;s recognition . For the role of gambling research in politics , 
recognition is becoming slow . In the United States , no question . But in the United Kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now . And in other countries , it &apos;s happening right now . 
People are in the process of recognizing that they think of happiness . If you think about politics , 
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will discuss whether you &apos;re exploring experience happiness , or whether you &apos;re going to explore life assessment . So we need to really soon have this discussion , 
how to increase happiness , very soon , very different things go . Depending on how you think , and whether you think about the memory self or whether you think about the living self or whether you think about the living self . 
That &apos;s going to affect politics . I think in the years ahead , 
in the United States , you &apos;re tightening on the experience happiness of the population to measure . 
That &apos;s going to , I think , be in the next one or two decades , part of the national statistics . 
CA : Well , it seems to me that this topic is going to , or should , at least be the most interesting political debate to follow over the next few years . 
Thank you very much . For inventing the behavioral economy . 
Thank you . Danny Kahneman : Today 
I &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate . 
And that might surprise you a little bit . Because my full @-@ time job at the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds , about things that we invent , and deliver , to make the poorest two billion dollars . Better life , to make possible . 
But energy and climate are extremely important . For these people , in fact , even more important than for anyone else on the planet . 
Climate degradation means that their seeds are growing unsustainable for many years , and we &apos;re going to be too raining too much or too little . Things are going to change as things change as their fragile environment doesn &apos;t stand . 
That leads to starvation . It leads to insecurity . It leads to unrest . 
So , climate change is going to be terrible for them . And 
also , the energy price for them is very important . 
The fact is , if you &apos;re just talking about one thing , you could reduce the price , to reduce poverty , energy would be by far the most effective . 
Now , the energy price is over time . 
In fact , the progress society is based on energy advances that drove 
coal evolution . Industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid fall in the electricity price . And that &apos;s why we have refrigerators . Air conditioning . We can make modern materials . And so many things . 
We &apos;re so in a wonderful place . We &apos;re in a situation with electricity in the rich world . 
But if we pay down the price , we let the price halve , we hit the price , we hit a new barrier . And this barrier is related to CO2 , 
CO2 warms the planet and the equation for the CO2 is . Actually , pretty clear . 
They sum up . The emitted . CO2 . Which one leads to temperature increase . And this temperature increase has some very negative effects : Effects on the weather . And maybe worse , the indirect effect is that natural ecosystems are so rapidly changing that they don &apos;t adapt . And so whole systems collapse . 
Now , the exact relationship between a CO2 increase and the resulting temperature change , and where they continue to follow . There are some ambiguities . But not very many . 
And there are certainly ambiguities about how bad this impact will be . But they become extremely bad . 
I have the top scientists several times asked , &quot; Do we really have to get down to near zero ? 
&quot; &quot; Is not half or a quarter enough ? 
&quot; The answer is , until we get near zero . Will the temperature rise further ? That &apos;s 
why it &apos;s a big challenge . 
It &apos;s very different from saying , &quot; We have a 3.5 meter high . &quot; It &apos;s under a three @-@ meter bridge . It has to be here . You can sort of squeeze it down below . This 
has to be downward @-@ looking to zero . 
Well , we run into a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons . 
Every American , about 20 tons of people from poor countries , less than one on average , 
it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet . 
And somehow we need to create changes that can bring that down to zero . 
It &apos;s been constantly increasing . 
Only different economic ones . Changes have it affected at all . And we need to be moved from rapid growth to reduction and to a reduction , except zero . 
This equation has four factors : A bit of multiplication . You have this thing on the left , CO2 , that you want to get to zero . And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen to the number of people , to the services that every human being uses on average , the average energy for every service , and the CO2 emitted per unit of energy . 
Let &apos;s therefore let &apos;s take every factor individually . And let &apos;s think about how we can get that to zero . 
Probably , one of these numbers has to be very close to zero . 
Now , that &apos;s basic algebra . But let &apos;s go through it . 
First of all , we have the population 
today . 6.8 billion people . 
And it &apos;s going to go to 9 billion , 
which is going to move to 9 billion . If we succeed very successfully with new vaccines , healthcare and reproductive medicine . Could we possibly do that by 10 to 15 percent ? But at the moment , we &apos;re seeing a 1.3 percent rise . 
The second factor is services , the services we use . 
This includes everything : Food that we eat , clothing , television , heating . 
These are very good things . And poverty reduction means these services almost to everyone on the planet accessible to them . 
It &apos;s great that this number is rising 
in the rich world , in the top billion , we might be able to make cuts and use less . But on average , this number is going to rise every year , and so overall , it &apos;s more than doubling . The number of services per person per person is going to increase . 
Here we see a very basic service . Are there at home lights to make sure you read the homework ? 
And these students have not . So they go out and read . Their school responsibilities under the street light . 
Now , effectiveness , the E , the energy per service , finally there &apos;s good news . 
We have something that doesn &apos;t go up . 
Because of different successes in the lighting sector , through other types of cars , through new building methods . There are many services whose energy they use to drastically reduce can dramatically be drastically reduced . 103.00 - 05.50 000 GT 00 00 : 05 53 000 Some services can be reduced by 90 % . 
Some individual services can be reduced by 90 % . 
Others can be reduced by 90 % by services such as fertilisers ( 105.00 - 05.56 000 GT 00 : 05 - 58.000 ) or air transport or air transport , and the room for improvement is much smaller . 
Overall , if we are optimistic , we may be going to get a 3 factor reduction , or maybe even a 3 factor reduction . 
But in the first three factors , we &apos;re now 26 . Billion to maybe the very best . 13 billion tons went . And that &apos;s just not enough . 
Let &apos;s look at the fourth factor . And this one is going to be a key factor . That &apos;s the amount of CO2 that &apos;s per unit of energy emitted . 
It turns out the question is whether you can do that to zero . 
If you burn coal , no , 
if you burn natural gas , no , 
almost every method of producing electricity emits . Today , CO2 , except renewable energy and nuclear energy . 
So what we do on a global scale must be a global new system to create a new system . 
We need energy under . 
If I &apos;m going to use the term &quot; miracle , &quot; I don &apos;t mean the impossible , 
the microprocessor is . A miracle , the PC is a miracle . 
The Internet and its services are a miracle . 
People here have become the development of many of these 
miracles , and they &apos;ve been doing it . Normally , there &apos;s no deadline for you to do a miracle until you have a certain date . 
Normally , you &apos;re just standing next to it . And some people don &apos;t come to others . In 
this case , we have to give full gas , and a miracle in a very short time . 
Well , I wondered , how can I really get this over ? 
Are there natural illustration , a demonstration , that shows the idea of the people here ? 
I remembered the last year . When I brought mosquitos and I kind of liked that . 
The idea became for them really tangible . You know , it &apos;s people who have mosquitos living 
for them for energy . I noticed this one . 
I decided that releasing mosquitoes of fireflies would be my contribution this year to the environment here . 
Here are a couple of natural fireflies . 
You &apos;ve assured me that they &apos;re not biting . In fact , they &apos;re probably not even going to leave the glass . 
Well , there &apos;s all kinds of game solutions like this . But they bring none of them much . 
We need solutions . Either one or more of them , which are an unimaginable scale and unimaginable reliability . And although there are many directions in which people are looking for it , I really only see five of them looking for these big challenges . 
I &apos;ve got tides , geothermal fusion and biofuels out there . 
They may be doing a moderate contribution . And if they do better than I expect , that would be great . But my key message here is that we &apos;re working on all those five . And we can &apos;t do any of them because they intimidate us . Because everybody has significant problems . 
Let &apos;s first look at burning . Fossil fuels : Burning either coal or coal or natural gas . 
What you do there seems to be easy . But that &apos;s not it . You &apos;d have to take all the CO2 that comes out of the chimney after burning . Catch under pressure , liquefy . And then somewhere , and hope that it &apos;s there . 
There are some pilot projects that do this on a 60 / 80 level . But it &apos;s 100 to get it , very difficult to get , and an agreement for storage of CO2 will be reached , and a big challenge . But the biggest problem . Here &apos;s the question of storage time . 
Who &apos;s going to make sure ? 
Who can guarantee something ? What literally many billions times bigger than any kind of waste ? You get away from nuclear and other nuclear and other things you 
can imagine . This is a lot of volume . 
This is a hard nut . 
Next , nuclear energy . 
It also has three major problems . The cost , especially in highly regulated countries , is high . The question of security is that you really feel that nothing goes wrong . Despite human cooperation , that the fuel is not for weapons , the fuel is not used . 
And what do you do then ? With the waste . 
Because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concern . People have to worry about it well . 
184.00 , 10 , 20,000 GT , 00 , 10 , 25,000 . 
So three very difficult problems that might be solvable . So three very difficult problems that might be solvable . And those that make you work on that should be 
the last three of the five . So I &apos;ll summarize . 
These are renewable energy . As you often call them , 
and also they have , although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel . They have some disadvantages : 
One is . The energy density that these technologies generate is dramatically lower than that of power plants . 
These are low @-@ energy energy . You talk about many square kilometers , thousands of times more space than a normal power plant . 
And they &apos;re also subject to interruptions . 
The sun doesn &apos;t shine all day long . It also doesn &apos;t shine every day . And the same way , the wind doesn &apos;t blow all the time . 
So you have to , if you &apos;re dependent on those sources , have a way to have the energy even in times . If you don &apos;t have it available to get it . 
There &apos;s so a lot of price challenges here . There are challenges in transmission . If , for example , we say that the energy source is outside the country , you don &apos;t just need the technology . You also need to be able to deal with the risk that the energy comes from where it comes from . 
And there &apos;s the storage problem . 
And to scale this up , I have been all sorts of different batteries that are manufactured , looking at those that are for cars , computers , mobile phones , flashlights for everything . And that &apos;s what I &apos;ve got with the amount of electronic energy that the world uses . I found out that all batteries that we now produce are less than 10 minutes of the total energy . 
Could we need to have a big breakthrough here ? Something that , by a factor of 100 , will be better than the approaches . Right now , 
this is not impossible . But it &apos;s not that easy . 
This is what happens when you try to find these interrupted sources , say , 20 @-@ 30 percent of consumption . 
If you &apos;re 100 percent based on this , you need a tremendous wonder battery . 
Now , where are we going to go ? What is the right approach ? 
A Manhattan project . How do we get to the finish ? 
What we need is a lot of companies working on this . Hundreds 
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people . 
For many , you will say , &quot; They &apos;re crazy . &quot; This is good . 
I think here in TED , I think there are many in the TED group who are already engaged . 
Bill Gross has several companies , including one called Esolar . The great . Solar thermal technologies have 
Vinod . Khosla is investing in dozens of companies . The great things are doing and interesting opportunities . And I &apos;m trying to support that . 
Nathan Myhrvold : And I &apos;m funding a company that , surprisingly , might be pursuing the nuclear approach . 
There are some innovations in the nuclear field : Modular , liquid , 
that &apos;s developing . In this industry a while ago , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some of the good concepts are lying around , 
the Terrapower concept means you &apos;re going to replace a part of the uranium , one percent , the U235 . We decided the 99 to burn . The U238 . That 
&apos;s a pretty crazy idea . 
But actually , you &apos;ve had a long time to think about it . But you could never simulate it sensibly . Whether it would work , but since it became modern supercomputers . Can you simulate it ? And you can see that yes , with the right approach to matter , it looks like it works , 
and because you burn these 99 , it &apos;s like it &apos;s actually 99 . The cost profile is much better . In fact , 
you burn the garbage , and you can even burn the garbage from today &apos;s reactors as 
a drive . Instead of talking about it , you burn it , you just burn it , a great thing . 
The uranium is used gradually . A little bit like a candle . 
You can see that it &apos;s a kind of column . It &apos;s often called a migratory wave , reactor 
, which really solves the fuel problem . 
Here &apos;s a picture of a place in Kentucky . 
This is the waste . The 99 . You have the part of the burned today . Taken out . So it &apos;s called &quot; depleted uranium . 
&quot; That shoots the U.S. for hundreds of hundreds of years . 
And if you buy ocean water cheap and simply filtered , you get enough fuel . For the rest of the planet &apos;s 
life . You know , there &apos;s still a lot of challenges . But it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that are being developed that we need to move forward . 
Let &apos;s think about how we can measure our success 
. How should our testimony look ? 
Well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to achieve . And then we talk about the intermediate step . 
Many talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 . 
It &apos;s really , really important that we get there , 
the remaining 20 percent are in poor countries , and the remaining 20 percent are still being produced in agriculture . Hopefully , forest threats and cement will be clean by then . 
So , around this 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like China , needs to completely transform their generation of electricity . 
The other note says , well , if we use zero emissions technology , if they &apos;re in all developed countries . And we on the way , they &apos;re on the way to getting the rest . 
That &apos;s super important . 
That &apos;s going to be a key element . This certificate , if we 
go back from there . How should that be 2020 testimony ? 
It should be back to the two elements . 
We should be using the effectiveness measures to reduce the amount of money that we &apos;re doing . The less we &apos;re emitting , the less CO2 we &apos;re going to get . And so will the temperature . 
But actually , this note is for things that we &apos;re doing , things that are not completely too much of a reduction . Just equal , or even a little less . Important , like the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs . 
These breakthroughs we need to track with full @-@ gas . And that &apos;s what we can measure . In company numbers , in pilot projects and regulatory changes . 
There are many great books on this subject 
that Al Gore has written . We have a choice , and David McKay &apos;s Sustainable Energy . Without the Hot Air , you 
go , really , and you create a framework in which this is widely discussed . Because we need support from all of the sides to do that . 
There are some things that need to come together . 
That &apos;s a wish . 
A very concrete wish that we can use this technology to invent . 
If you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , let me . I could give the president a choice : A vaccine . And that &apos;s what I love . Or I could choose that wish . That is half @-@ energy price . Without CO2 , it &apos;s invented . That wish I would take . 
This one has the greatest impact . 
If we take that wish , it will be the gap between the long @-@ term and the short @-@ term thinking people . Between the United States and China , between the poor and rich countries , and almost all lives . This 2 billion is going to be much worse . 
What do we have to do ? 
What measures do I appeal for ? 
We have to work for more research funding . 
If countries are in places like Koppenhagen , countries should not meet just through CO2 , 
they should talk about it . They should discuss this innovation strategy . And they would be shocked by the ridiculous . Low money that &apos;s being spent on these innovative approaches . 
We need market incentives . We need carbon taxes . CAP . Amp ; Trade . Something that sends a price signal . 
We need to spread the news . 
We need dialogue , more rational and complete , and things also need to be done by the government . 
It &apos;s an important wish . But I think we can fulfill it . 
Thank you very much . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . Thank you . 
Thank you . Thank you very much . Just to get a little better at understanding Terrapower . First of all , you can give us an idea of the scale of this investment . 
Bill Gates : To simulate on a supercomputer , you know . All the big scientists get what we did , you need to have just a few 10 million . And even if we can put our materials in a Russian reactor , to make sure that it &apos;s working properly . Is it just in the 100 million of the hard ones ? Step 
by step , building the first reactor is another billion to find . The regulations and the place where they actually are the first to build . 
Once the first is finished , when it &apos;s running as promised , then everything is all very clear . Because the profitability , the energy density , is so different from nuclear energy as we are . 
You know . CA : To get that right . That means deep into the ground . Almost like a vertical pillar of nuclear fuel . This spent uranium , and then the process starts at the top and continues . Down . 
BG : Exactly . Today , you have to reconnect the reactor . So there are lots of people and lots of controls that go wrong . This thing , where you open it up and things get in or out . This is not good . 
If you do , however , have very cheap fuel , you can refill it for 60 years . Think about a column that you can bury without the whole thing complexity . 
And it sits there and burns . 60 years . And then it &apos;s done . 
CA : A nuclear reactor that itself is a solution to the garbage . 
BG : Yeah . Well , what about the garbage ? You can sit it . There &apos;s much less garbage . With this method , you take it and pack it into the waste in the next reactor and burn it further . 
And we start by putting the garbage away from the waste that already exists , that already exists in these refrigerators or dry tanks , at the reactors . That &apos;s our starting fuel . 
So that &apos;s what this reactors are . What we &apos;re doing in our fill , and that &apos;s going to dramatically reduce the garbage volume . During this process . 
CA : But as you &apos;re working with different people in the world on these possibilities . 
Where is the greatest interest ? So what really is going to happen ? 
BG : Well , we haven &apos;t got to a place yet . And there &apos;s a lot of interesting disclosure rules for everything . The nuclear in the name carries it . There &apos;s a lot of interest . And people in the company were in Russia , India , China . I was here and I have the Energy Minister and I &apos;ve been talking about how this fits the energy agenda . 
I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the French and Japanese have something in the direction of 
this . This is a variant of one thing . It was done . 
This is an important step forward . But it &apos;s like a fast reactor . And some countries have built this . So everybody who &apos;s building a fast reactor is the one who has implemented it . A candidature for our first one . 
CA : In your imagination , timeframe and probability . This is really what you want to create . 
BG : Well , we need one of these scalable , power generating things that is very cheap . We have 20 years to invent . And then 20 years to deploy . 
This is kind of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us , which we have to meet . 
And you know , Terrapower , if everything goes well . And that &apos;s a big wish . Could that keep 
it easy ? And fortunately , today , there are dozens of companies , and we need hundreds , which , if their approaches work , as well . Promoting support for their pilots works for that . Can offer , 
and it would be best . If there are several , because then you could create a mix . Anyway , you 
need a solution . 
CA : Concerning the big possible breakthroughs , this is the biggest thing you know . 
BG : An energy break is the most important thing . 
That would be without the environmental challenge . But the power is still doing so much more , more importantly , 
in the nuclear sector . Are there other innovative things 
? Companies ? You know , we know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as these . But there are the modular methods . That &apos;s another approach . 
There &apos;s a liquid reactor type that &apos;s kind of difficult . But maybe the ones who say that about us . 
And so there are different ones . But the beauty of that is that a uranium molecule is a million times as much energy as a say , say , a carbon molecule . And so if you &apos;re dealing with the problems and the problems are mainly the radiation , the footprint . And the cost is the potential . So the impact on the countryside and other things , almost in one &apos;s own league . 
CA : If that doesn &apos;t work , what 
do we have to do is take emergency measures to try and keep the Earth temperature stable ? 
BG : If you &apos;re in this situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;re eating too much . And just before a heart attack , what do you do ? Then ... You might need a heart surgery or something like that . 
There &apos;s a research that &apos;s going on called geoengineering , which is going to look at different techniques to delay warming , so we can 20 or 30 years longer get to get together . 
That &apos;s just an insurance method . 
You hope we can &apos;t need that . 
Some people say you should not even get to the insurance first to work because you can maybe be lazy , so you can eat , because you know you &apos;re eating , because you &apos;re going to save you from heart surgery . 
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart if you look at the importance of this problem , and I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s smart . But there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering about whether to do that , whether you have to have it . If things get faster or if they get this innovation longer than we expect . 
CA : Climate skeptics , do you have one or two sentences ? For those around you , perhaps to convince you . 
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps . 
Those who have scientific arguments are very little . 
Tell them that there are negative effects that can be caused by clouds . Things shift . 
There are very , very few things that they even can say , of which there is a chance in a million , in a million . 
The main problem here is similar to the problem of AIDS . 
You make the mistake . Now , and you pay a lot later on . 
And so that &apos;s why the idea is now . If you can take all kinds of urgent problems into investing in something that you &apos;re only going to have later on , and then you get the investment not so clear that it &apos;s going to be . In fact , the IPCC Report is not necessarily . The worst scenario . And there are people in the rich world who are going to look at IPCC and say , &quot; Okay . This is not a big drama . The 
fact is that this uncertainty gives us cause for concern . 
But my dream here is that if you want to make it economically and at the same time eliminate CO2 . &quot; Then you also have skeptics saying . Okay . It interests me not that it &apos;s not emitting CO2 . I wish almost that it did that . But I &apos;m probably going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . CA 
: And that would be your answer to Björn Lomborg &apos;s argument that if you were to spend all of this time and energy using CO2 to solve the problem . All the other goals are suffering , poverty reduction . Combating poverty is suffering from malaria and so on , that it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources . Money to invest for it , while it &apos;s better things that we can do . 
BG : Well , the actual spending on research , let &apos;s say the U.S. should . 10 billion a year . More than spending today than you do . That &apos;s not so dramatic . 
It should be other things that should not suffer . 
You come to big amounts of money . And here , sensible people can contradict . If you have something that &apos;s not economically sound and you try to finance it . For me , this is what &apos;s happening . Most waste . It &apos;s 
unless you &apos;re very short on the eve of a breakthrough in cost , and you only fund the learning curve . I think we should do more things that try to have the potential . A lot cheaper to do . 
If the swab you get is a very high energy price , you know ? Then you can only keep the rich up . 
I mean , each of us here could do five times as much for our energy , without spending our lifestyle on 
changing . For the lower two billion . 
But is it a disaster ? And even Lomborg thinks about 
his new mesh , &quot; Why is it that research isn &apos;t going to be discussed anymore ? &quot; 
He &apos;s still being discussed because of his earlier stories with the skeptic camp . But he understood that this is one very lonely group , and he &apos;s been talking about it . And so he &apos;s 
now bringing the research argument . And that &apos;s a thought that I &apos;m thinking is appropriate . 
Research , it &apos;s just crazy . How little does it support ? CA 
: Bill . I think I speak for almost everybody . If I say , &quot; I really hope that your desire will come true . &quot; Thank you very much . 
BG : Thank you . 
I would like to tell you something . What I thought I &apos;d like to do a few months ago when I wrote an article for Italian . Wired noticed , 
I noticed when I was writing , that I always got my synonymous dictionary ready for use . But I was with editing the dictionary . And I noticed that I was still never in my life , looking at it . What the word hinders really means , &quot; I 
read you the entry , 
disabled , adjective , crippled . &quot; Helpless , useless , destroyed . Deceased , mutilated , wounded , prepared . Ham , separated , preserved , deserved , weakened , impotent , castrated , paralyzed . Gehandicapt , senil , age @-@ weak , withdrawn , repaired , done , broken . Gehnstetten , counted @ ( see also injured ) Useless and weak Anonyme 
, healthy , strong Powerful I have this 
list with a friend read out loud and I had to laugh first . It worked so ridiculous . But I just came up prepared and could not be able to speak any more and had to stop reading . And I first collected after this assaulted flood of words and the associated emotional . 
Shock . Of course , this was a fractured old synonym dictionary . I got just thinking that the word issue was pretty old , it had 
to be old . But actually , it was an issue on the early &apos; 80s . When I was just in primary school , and I started doing this , my self @-@ image . Outside my family environment , and building and shaping it . Also in terms of other kids and other kids and the rest of the world around me . 
And God thank God , I did not have a synonymous dictionary at the time , if 
I were to take this entry seriously . Would I be into a world born of someone like me as a person who would perceive me as a person whose lives in no way can be positive ? But today I &apos;m going to vote for opportunities and adventures that I &apos;ve experienced . 
So I &apos;ve been celebrated immediately , the online edition of 2009 , and I expected that I &apos;m going to make a more appealing contribution here . 
Here &apos;s the updated version . This entry , 
unfortunately , is not much better . 
In particular , the last two words shake me under Near Anonyms . All right and healthy . But 
it &apos;s not just about the words . 
It &apos;s about what we &apos;re talking about people who we think about with these words , and they &apos;re not about what we &apos;re talking about . 
It &apos;s about values , the values that are in those words , and how we &apos;re building those values . 
Our language is influencing our thinking . And how we &apos;re shaping the world and the people around us . 
Many ancient societies , including Greeks , and Greeks and Romans , really believed that the world debate of a curse would be a powerful force , because what you &apos;re saying loud is also manifesting itself , and it &apos;s a powerful force . 
So what do we actually want to manifest ? A disabled person or a powerful person . People alone , a human being , careless . 
As a child , it could be enough to restrict them and to give them ideas . To put them over @-@ closures would not be 
more beautiful to open doors to them . A 
human being who for me opens doors was my pediatrician . AM A.I.I. DuPont Institute in Wilmington , in Delaware . 
His name is Dr. Pizzutillo , an Italo @-@ American whose name , you can imagine . Most Americans , not correctly speaking , could not speak . So he was always Dr. P. 
called Dr. P. And Dr. P. always wore very colorful flies and was for the kids to work with , you know . 
Just like created . I found the time I was in this hospital that I spent , just great . Except for my physiotherapy . 
I had to do individual exercises , seemingly infinitely often . With these thick elastic bands in different colors . You know that around . My leg muscles build up , and I have hated these bands more than anything else . I have hated them . I have cursed them . I have hated them 
and put them in perspective . I even have as a kid of five with Dr. P. negotiated with Dr. And so this is how I try to stop these exercises . Natural , without success . 
And one day he has cursed me at one of my exercises . These exercises were just tiring and merciless . And he said to me , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young . Girl : You &apos;ll one day be one of these tapes tearing . 
And if you can do it , I &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot; 
That was , of course , just a simple trick by Dr. P. to do the exercises that I don &apos;t do , right ? With the prospect that the richest five @-@ year @-@ old girl in the hospital will be on the second floor . But he has actually made me do my daily exercise horror with new eyes , to see . So it has made a new and promising experience . 
And I wonder today how much I like his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl . My self @-@ image has shaped and I imagine it was like I was one of nature &apos;s strong , powerful and atlethic people , to see myself as one of the most atlethic . 
This is just one example of many of us adults in power positions . Imagination of a child can inspire . 
But how do the examples from the examples already cited from the synonymous dictionaries prove that our language doesn &apos;t allow us any room to imagine something ? What we all want would it be for each and every one of us to allow ourselves to be seen as powerful people . 
Our language lags behind social change . The changes that we often see through a technological change are often triggered by a technological 
change . From a medical point of view , of course , one can say that my legs , laser surgery for visually impaired visually impaired , knee joints made of titanium and artificial hip joints for aging bodies , which allow people to really use all their possibilities and to transcend the limits that their natural destiny has set them , to develop . Not to speak of social networking at all . People allow themselves to have their own identity , give themselves in their own way , define themselves , 
thereby becoming involved worldwide in groups that are their own , choosing themselves . 
Perhaps , then , this technological change is clearer . Because ever before , it &apos;s always been a different truth , that everyone has ever been able to tell society something very special and very powerful , and that the human being &apos;s ability to adapt . Our greatest plus is 
the human ability to adapt . That &apos;s an interesting story . Because people always keep asking me to ask me to tell how I can deal with adversity . And I &apos;m going to confess something to you : This sentence has . For me , never fit , and I &apos;ve always been very uncomfortable . I &apos;ve felt so . The questions of people about answering these questions . And I think , gradually , I understand . 
Why ? This sentence about how to deal with adversity lives from the idea that success or happiness comes from it . A challenge to master . Without being confronted by the experience that it brings when it comes to me , as if my life had been so successful . Because I have to recognize the possible traps of a life with a prosthesis . Or just anyway , people , with my disability , perceive me . 
But the truth is that we are changing . Of course , we are shaped by the challenge . Whether you &apos;re physically , emotionally or even both . 
And I &apos;m saying that &apos;s good . 
Distastements are not an obstacle that we need to curve to work with our lives better , to make 
it clear . Diversity is just part of our lives . 
And I tend to treat distress as my shadow . 
Sometimes I realize that it &apos;s very present . Sometimes it &apos;s hardly visible . But it &apos;s constantly with me . 
And I want to make absolutely no sense of the impact or severity of a human being &apos;s struggle . 
There are in life distress and challenges and the challenges are only too real . And every person goes different . But to ask the question is not whether we can make it clear with adversity or not , but how we make it clear . We are 
not just for that to happen . People who we love before blows of fate save us from blows of fate , but also to prepare them for it . All right . So , to get it right . 
And we do our kids no favours . If we give them the feeling that they feel they don &apos;t adapt . 
You have to get two things to separate clearly . One is medical fact amputees . And the other is medical fact . Social opinion about whether I &apos;m disabled is disabled or not . 
And to be honest , the only real and lasting disability is with the one I have to deal with , and to be honest , the world is constantly saying . It can connect me with these definitions . 
In our desire to engage with people who protect us , who care about us , and to give them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis , or even a prognosis of quality of life that they expect . We must be careful not to lay the foundation for someone to actually obstruct , or indeed to prevent , someone from being disabled . 
Perhaps that is the current concept , which only looks at it . What happens in a broken , and how we fix it for everyone , is a bigger disability than the pathology for each one of us . 
If we want to avoid treating a person holistically and not all of his forces and possibilities . And recognize , we create , in addition to the natural struggle that you may need to fight . 
Another disease . We degrade a person who is responsible for our society , a person who is valued . 
So we need to talk beyond patology , and look at the whole range of human areas of 
opportunity . Most importantly , however , it &apos;s that there &apos;s a gap between perception of our inadequacies and our great inventive spirit . 
We should be connecting these challenging times , not devaluing or denying them . We should not try to avoid them . We should not try to avoid them , nor should we sweep them under the carpet , but it &apos;s going on . That &apos;s what opportunities in adversity are about . 
It &apos;s maybe more about making it clear to me that we &apos;re not necessarily going to have to overcome adversity , but that we &apos;re open to embracing it , embracing it in the head , to grab a fight expression , to use it as well . And maybe even to dance with it . 
And maybe we can do things like adversity as something natural , coherent and useful , and feel like this through the way they &apos;re present , not so burdened . In 
this year , we celebrate the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin . And when he was 150 years ago about evolution , he wrote about evolution , Darwin , in my view , has something very true in human character . 
I would say it that way , not the strongest of its kind survives . And neither does it survive the smartest of its kind , but the one that best adapts to change . 
Conflicts are creating creativity , not just 
from Darwin &apos;s work . Do we know that the human capacity to survive and flourish is dependent on the struggle of the human mind ? It &apos;s determined by conflict to change . 
So again , change and adaptation are the greatest abilities of man . 
And maybe we know only from which wood . We &apos;re carved when we &apos;re really tested . 
Maybe that &apos;s exactly the meaning of adversity . A perception of ego . A sense of our own power . 
We can feel ourselves something like this . 
We can give adversity a new meaning that &apos;s about difficult times beyond difficult times . 
Maybe we can treat adversity as change . 
Adversity stands for change . We can see change that we don &apos;t yet adapt to . 
I think the greatest damage we do to ourselves is the greatest damage we believe we have done to ourselves to be normal . 
Let &apos;s face it . Who &apos;s normal ? 
There &apos;s no normal . 
There &apos;s the usual , the typical , but not the normal , and would you like to give this poor , gray person ? Really know . Do you want to learn ? 
If it really existed , I think more of a thing . It would be great 
if we could have this pattern of normality versus another of the possibilities or the strength around it , even another little bit more dangerous to put it in . So we can exchange the forces of very many children . And to invite them to share their very special and valuable abilities in society . 
Anthropolgen has found that we humans are being driven by the members of our society to always demand one thing : To be useful and to contribute to it . 
There are indications that there are already Neanderthals who , 60,000 years ago , older people and people with severe physical problems , with worn injuries , who were born . And that might have happened because life experience in the struggle for survival of these people is valuable to society . 
They have these people not broken as broken and useless . They &apos;ve been seen as something special . And valuable . 
A few years ago , I went to the city , the city where I grew up , to a food market . In that Red Zone , in the northeast of Pennsylvania , and I stood there in front of a cup of tomatoes . 
It was summer . And I had shorts . And 
I hear a guy behind it listening to me say , &quot; &quot; Well , if that &apos;s not Aimee Mullins , 
and I &apos;m turning around and I see this older man . &quot; I had no idea who he is . 
And I said , &quot; Excuse me . Sir , do we know ? &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t get to . You remember . &quot; And 
he said , &quot; Well , yeah . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re unlikely to get to grips with that . 
&quot; &quot; Remember me when I first first first saw it , I first looked at it from the belly of her mother . &quot; &quot; 
Oh , so , he 
, &quot; and of course , it did , but click . 
That was Dr. Kean . A man I just made of narratives of my mother about this day , Because I was , of course , quite typical of my birthday , two weeks late . 
The doctor for prenatal diagnostics of my mother was on vacation . And so my parents knew the man , the man who gave me birth , not at all . 
And because I was born without a calf &apos;s legs . And my feet , after them , had directed themselves . And I just had a few toes . On this one and a few toes on the other foot was he who had the handler of this stranger had to . The bad news had to pass . 
He said to me , &quot; I had to tell your parents that you would never walk and never walk and never be so mobile . Would you be like other kids , or you would never live an independent life ? &quot; And since then , they &apos;ve just lied to me . Punished . Really 
? Exceptional , I found that he &apos;s been cutting newspaper clips of my entire childhood . Whether I was in a letter contest in the second grade , whether I had won . Whether I was with the scouts at the parade at Halloween , whether I was traveling with my scholarship or a scholarship or one of my sporting victories . And he used these clips to make his students teach . Medical students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School . 
And he called this part of his course the X factor , the potential of human will . 
You can &apos;t do enough to emphasize how crucial this factor is to quality of life for a human being . 
And Dr. Kean continued . He said , &quot; I learned that when you don &apos;t keep on telling something else , and you know , even if you just have a little bit of support , children get a little bit of support . If you have kids left to yourself , then children can have a lot to do . Look 
. Dr. Kean has his thinking changed . 
He had understood that the medical diagnosis and how someone could do with it . Two different things are , 
and so are two different things . I have my thinking going on over time . If you can tell me at the age of 15 , if I had my prostheses against legs from meat and meat and bone , would I have changed ? Then I wouldn &apos;t have hesitated for a second . 
I wanted to be normal at the time . 
If you would have asked me that today , I &apos;m not so sure . 
And that &apos;s what happened because I have something to do with my legs , not despite these experiences . 
And maybe this change could happen as well , because I &apos;ve been meeting so many people who have opened doors to me . Instead of meeting people who restrict me or restrict me or 
imagine myself , I &apos;ve been able to do this . Look . It really only takes one person to tell you . How do you manifest your forces and how you &apos;re through ? 
If you want to allow someone to make their own inner forces work . The human mind is so receptive . If you can do that and for someone in a crucial moment , a door opens . Then you &apos;re for these people a very good teacher . 
You bring them with you doors to themselves to 
open . The real meaning of the word . Educate is rooted in the word educe . It 
means producing something that in a person is the potential to tickle out . Again 
, what potential do we want ? Well , call 
in the &apos; 60s , in Britain , a case study was done . Back then , high schools were 
transformed into total schools . They call that streaming trials . In the United States , 
we call that tracking . Students are being trained in grades . 
And the A students are getting heavier orally than they are . The better teachers , etc . 
, they have a three @-@ month period of time , students with a sufficient one . The grade very well given . It was told them . They were Aces that they were very smart . And after those three months , they really have written Einster . 
And of course , it breaks you down . The heart to hear that the other way around , the Einster students were told . They were just enough . And 
the same was the case after the three months . But only 
those who still have to live in school , apart from the students who were the school school school @-@ makers . 
And it was very important in this study that teachers were not inaugurated . 
Teachers knew not that something changed . 
They were just told that they were the one @-@ serer students , and that they were the students with the grade enough . And the same way , they taught them something . 
And they treated the only real disability is a broken mind . A spirit that was broken has no hope anymore . It doesn &apos;t find anything beautiful anymore . It lacks our natural childish curiosity and our innate ability to understand imagination . 
If we do , however , we can do the human mind to help to continue hoping , to hope , to self @-@ hope and other people around it . Beautiful to find , curious and imaginative to be . Then we put our forces really positively into action . 
If a mind is talking about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new forms of existence . 
I want to start with a poem that &apos;s written by a Persian poet named Hafiz in the 14th century . And from which my friend Jacques , Dembois , told me , and the poem is called &quot; The God Who Only Words Four . &quot; Every child knows God , not the God . The name , not the God . The prohibition , but the God Who only speaks four words . And these are repeated all the time . He always says , 
&quot; Come dance with me . &quot; &quot; Come dance with me . &quot; Thank you very much .
