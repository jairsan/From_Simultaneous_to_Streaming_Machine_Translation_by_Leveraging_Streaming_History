A few years ago here at TED , Peter Skillman launched a design competition called &quot; The Marshmallow Challenge . 
&quot; The idea is pretty simple . Four teams have to have the widest possible freestanding structure with 20 spaghetti . CA : 1m tape . CA : 1m thread and build a marshmallow . 
The marshmallow has to be up there . 
And though it really seems simple , it &apos;s actually really hard . Because it &apos;s pushing people to work together very quickly . 
And so I thought this was an interesting idea . And I put it into a design workshop . 
It was a huge success . 
Since then , I &apos;ve been doing about 70 workshops around the world with students , developers and architects , even CTOs , the Fortune 50 companies . And there &apos;s something about this task . What deep impressions into the nature of collaboration allow . And I want to share some of these with you . 
Normally , most people start themselves with the task of orienting themselves . 
They talk about it . They think about what it will look like . They &apos;re rangling for power . 
Then they invest a little time in planning and organization . They sketch and put spaghetti out . 
They invest a lot of their time in assembly . Constantly growing structures . 
And finally , just before they have no time , someone takes the Marshmallow . And they gently put it on the top , step . One step back and TA @-@ DA . Admire your work . 
But then what happened almost always is that TA @-@ DA becomes an UH @-@ Oh , because the weight of the marshmallow causes the whole thing to bend and collapse . 
There are a number of people who have a lot more UH @-@ Oh moments than others . And among the worst are freshest BWL graduates . 
They lie , they cheat . They &apos;re confused and they really produce poor shapes . 
And of course there are teams that have a lot more TA @-@ DA formations . And among the best are freshness graduates of the kindergarten . 
And that &apos;s quite amazing . 
As Peter told us , they not only produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all . 
What you might ask is , how does that come ? Why ? What about those ? 
And Peter doesn &apos;t tell them , &quot; Time is invested . In this , being the head of Spaghetti GmbH . &quot; They 
don &apos;t invest time in power struggles . 
But there &apos;s another reason . 
And that &apos;s that BWL students were trained to find a real plan . OK . 
And then to realize 
what happens . If you put the Marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time anymore . And what happens ? 
It &apos;s a crisis . 
Sounds familiar . What do 
kindergarten kids do differently is they do the Marshmallow and prototypes build . Successful prototypes , always with the Marshmallow at the top , so they have the opportunity to have multiple repair of dilapidated prototypes . 
Constructors recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of an iterative process . 
And with every attempt , the kids get immediate feedback . What works ? And what doesn &apos;t work ? 
So the prototyping performance is to work with . But let &apos;s see how different teams operate . 
The average for most is about 50 centimeters . BWL students create . Half of them lawyers do a little bit more . But not much kindergarten kids are better than adults . 
Who &apos;s the most successful architect 
and engineer ? Fortunately . 
1M is the highest . What I &apos;ve seen 
and why ? Because you understand triangles and you &apos;re self @-@ reinforcing geometric patterns . The key to building stable structures is 
that CEOs are slightly above average . But here it gets interesting . 
You put an executive administrator in there . The team makes them significantly better . 
It &apos;s incredible . You look around and you see this team will win . You 
can predict that . Why is that ? 
Because you have special process monitoring skills . 
You run the process . You understand it 
and that team . That regulates and works . It pays attention to the performance of the team will significantly improve . 
Specialized skills and process skills and their combination will lead to success . 
If you have 10 teams that are typical , you get . CA : 6 . The stable structures have 
â€” I tried something exciting . 
I thought , let &apos;s get the poker bet right away . 
So I offered a $ 10,000 prize for the winners . 
What do you think ? Did this design student happen ? 
What was that ? 
Result : This was not what happened . A team had a stable structure . 
If anyone had a two @-@ inch construction , he would have the prize home . 
So isn &apos;t it interesting that high betting has a strong effect ? 
We repeated this exercise with the same students . 
What do you think happened ? 
Well , you understood the advantage of prototyping . 
So it turned out that the same bad team , one of the best . 
They made the highest construction in the least time . 
So there are profound lessons for us about the nature of propulsion and success . 
You might ask , why would someone actually invest time ? Creating a Marshmallow Challenge . 
The reason is , I help . Digital tools and processes create teams to help . Cars , video games and visual effects . 
And what the Marshmallow Challenge does is it helps you identify hidden assumptions , 
because frankly , every project has its own Marshmallow . The 
challenge is a shared experience , a shared language or attitude , the right prototype to 
build . And this is the value of this experience . This simple exercise , 
and those of you who are interested in it , can be MarshmallowChallenge 
. COM : Visit . It &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the Marshmallows . 
There &apos;s a step @-@ by @-@ step guide there . 
You can find crazy examples from around the world of how people optimize and refiner the system . 
There are also world records . 
And the basal lesson , I think , is the construction , actually , a connecting one . Sport is what 
it requires that we all put our senses on the task , and that we optimally use our thinking , like our emotions and our actions in the challenge , the challenge ahead of us . 
And sometimes a small prototype . This experience , everything it takes . We &apos;re from an UH @-@ Oh to a TA @-@ DA moment . 
And this can make a big difference . 
Thank you very much . 
Let &apos;s pretend we have a machine here . 
A big machine . A cool TED @-@ like machine . And this is a time machine . 
And everybody in this room has to enter . 
And you can go back to the past . You can go into the future . You can &apos;t go into this one . 
And now stay there . And I wonder what you would choose because I would be able to tell my friends a lot recently . And I asked this question , and they all wanted to go back to the past . 
I don &apos;t know . They wanted to go back to time before cars existed . Or Twitter , or America is looking for the superstar . 
I don &apos;t know . 
I &apos;m convinced that somehow you can go to nostalgia , wishful thinking . 
And I understand that . 
I &apos;m not part of this group , I have to say . 
I don &apos;t want to go back to the past . And that &apos;s not because I &apos;m an adventurer . 
It &apos;s because opportunities on this planet are not going back . They &apos;re going forward . 
So I want to go into this machine . And I want to go into the future . 
This is the greatest time it &apos;s ever been on this planet . No matter what scale you &apos;re applying . Health , wealth . Mobility . Opportunities . Declining disease rates . There has 
never been a time like this before . 
My great grandparents all died when they were 60 . 
My grandparents pushed this number to 70 . 
My parents are 80 on their heels . 
So there should be a nine at the beginning of my death . 
But it &apos;s not even about people like us . Because this is a bigger thing . Than 
a child who &apos;s born today in New Delhi can expect . To live as long as the richest man in the world . 100 years ago , 
think about it . This is an incredible fact . 
And why is this ? 
Skirts , smallpox has billions of people on this planet killed . 
They have the demographics of the Earth in a way that they have redesigned . How it &apos;s not war ? It &apos;s ever done . 
They &apos;re gone . They &apos;ve disappeared . 
We &apos;ve defeated them . Puff 
in the rich world : There are diseases that millions of us have in danger of just a generation ago . Hardly any 
diphtheria is rubbing , polio knows 
anything . Somebody else , what that is ? 
Vaccines . Modern medicine . Our ability to feed billions of people . These are successes of the scientific method , 
and in my view , it &apos;s : The scientific method of trying things out , see if it works . It changes . If it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity . 
So that &apos;s the good news . 
Unfortunately , that &apos;s the good news . Because there are some other problems . And they &apos;ve been mentioned many times , 
and one . One of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people in the world are going hungry to bed every day . 
That number is rising , and it &apos;s rising very quickly . And that &apos;s embarrassing . 
And not just that . We have our imagination . We &apos;ve used this to thoroughly devastate this world : 
Drinking water , primal land . Rainforests , oil , gas . They disappear . And they disappear soon . And if we don &apos;t innovate out of this chaos , we also disappear . 
The question is : So can we do that ? I think so . 
I think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food . The billions of people who feed without the land they live on will feed without rape . 
I think we can use energy to power this world that doesn &apos;t destroy it at the same time . 
I really think so . And no . This is not wishful thinking . 
But this is keeping me awake at night . One of the things that keeps me awake at night . We still have never seen so much scientific progress as we &apos;ve ever seen before . And 
we &apos;ve never been able to do it properly . Just as we can today . 
We &apos;re on the threshold of amazing , amazing events in many areas . And yet , I really think we &apos;ve been hundreds of 300 years before the Enlightenment had to go back to find a time . In which we &apos;ve been fighting progress where we &apos;re going to be more violent about these things . More fronts than we are now . 
People are wrapping themselves in their faith , so tight that you can &apos;t liberate them , so hard . 
Not even . The truth will liberate them and hear 
them . Everyone has a right to their opinion . Even a right to their opinion on progress . 
But you know what they don &apos;t have a right to . 
You don &apos;t have a right to their own facts , to blame . Don &apos;t you ? And I 
took a while to figure out , 
about a decade ago , I published an article about immunization for The New Yorker , an article that I wrote . 
And I was amazed to encounter resistance , resistance to what was happening at the end of the day , the most effective measure . In healthcare , in the history of humanity , is . 
I didn &apos;t know what to do . So I just did what I always do . I wrote an article and I went on . 
And soon afterwards , I wrote an article about genetically modified . Food : The 
same thing , just bigger . 
People were crazy . 
So I also have written an article about it . And I couldn &apos;t understand why people thought . That would be frankenfood . Why ? They believed molecules were on a certain molecule , rather than a random way of moving around , an attack on nature . 
But you know , I do what I do . I wrote the article . I went on . 
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist . 
We type . We reach . We go eat . That &apos;s okay . 
But these articles worried me . And I couldn &apos;t figure out . Why ? And finally , I found out . 
And that &apos;s because these fanatics who mad me even got me out of the fanatics . 
These were prudent people , educated people , decent people . People , 
they were just like the people in this room . 
And that got me so confused . 
But then I thought , you know what ? Let &apos;s be honest . 
We &apos;re at a point where we &apos;re not the same relationship to progress , right ? As in the past . 
We talk about it in two ways . 
We talk about it ironically , with little quotes . That &apos;s why progress is . Okay 
. There are reasons for that . And I think we know what reasons are . 
We have trust in institutions , in authority . And sometimes in science itself , we have lost . And there &apos;s no reason why that &apos;s not supposed to be like that . 
You can just name a few names . And people will understand 
Chernobyl , Bhopal , Challenger , Vioxx , weapons of mass destruction . The 2000 US presidential election . I mean , 
you know , you can choose your own list . 
There are questions and problems with people from whom we thought we were always right . So be skeptical . 
Ask questions , ask evidence , demand evidence . 
You provide evidence . Take nothing 
but given . But now it &apos;s when you get evidence , you have to accept that evidence . And in that , we &apos;re not good . And I can 
do that for the reason that we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear . As I &apos;ve never seen before . And hopefully never again , 
about 12 years ago , it became . A story was published . A terrible story that the Autism epidemic with the measles , mumps and rubells associated vaccine . 
Very scary . 
Haufenwise studies were done to see if that was true , 
Haufenwise . Studies were to be conducted . This is a serious matter . 
The data came in . 
The data came in from the United States . England , Sweden , Canada . And they were all the same , no correlation . No connection , no connection at all . 
It makes no difference . It makes no difference . Because we believe in anecdotes . We believe what we see , what we believe we see . What causes us to feel real ? 
We don &apos;t believe in a bundle of documents from a government agency that gives us data . And I understand that . I think we all do that . 
But you know what ? 
The result of that was catastrophic , catastrophic . 
Because of that fact , the United States is one of the only countries in the world . In which the vaccine rate for measles is falling . 
That &apos;s scandalous . And we should be ashamed . 
It &apos;s terrible . 
What happened is that we could do that ? 
Well , I understand that . I do . 
Because does anybody here have measles ? 
Does one in the audience have ? JE : Anyone who sees people dying of measles 
doesn &apos;t happen very often . 
In this country , not at all . But 160,000 times in the world . Last year , 
these are many deaths from measles : 20 per hour . 
But because this hasn &apos;t happened here . Can we push it out ? And people like Jenny McCarthy can walk around and send messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like Oprah and Larry King preach live . And 
you can do that because they cause and correlation not connect . 
They don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same . But almost never are the same . 
And that &apos;s something we need to learn . And that &apos;s very fast . 
This guy was a hero . Jonas Salk : 
He liberated us from one of the worst scourges of humanity . Don &apos;t worry 
, no pain , polio . Puff disappeared . 
The guy in the middle . Not so much . 
He &apos;s called . Paul Offit : 
He just got a couple of other people to develop a rotavirus vaccine . 
He can live the lives of 400 , 500,000 children a year in developing countries . 
Very good . Not . 
Well . That &apos;s good . Apart from Paul walking around talking about vaccines and saying , &quot; How valuable ? They are , and people should just stop . &quot; Complaining , 
and he actually says that . 
So Paul is a terrorist . 
If Paul is speaking at a public hearing , he cannot speak without armed guards . 
He gets calls at home because people like to tell him they know where his kids know where to go to school . 
And why ? Because Paul made a vaccine . 
I don &apos;t need to say that . But vaccines are essential . 
Take them away . Returning the diseases back . Terrible diseases . And that &apos;s what &apos;s happening right now . 
We have in this country measles now . 
And that &apos;s getting worse . And pretty soon , kids will die of it again . Because this is just a question of numbers . 
And they &apos;re not just going to die of measles . 
What about polio ? Let &apos;s take that . Why not ? 
A fellow militant of mine told me a few weeks ago , and she said , &quot; She believes . I &apos;m a little too shrill . 
Nobody has that . &quot; Ever before , 
she said she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against polio . Absolutely not 
fine . 
Why ? Because we don &apos;t have polio . And you know what ? 
We had in this country yesterday no polio . 
Today , I don &apos;t know . Maybe this morning rose . Someone in Lagos , flying in an airplane , is flying to Los Angeles . Right now , he &apos;s over Ohio . 
And in a few hours , he lands . And rents a car . And he comes to Long Beach . And he &apos;s going to be one of these fantastic TED dinner . And he &apos;s going to visit tonight , 
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a paralyzing disease . And we don &apos;t know . Because that &apos;s how the world works . 
Well , this is the planet on which we live . Don &apos;t pretend that he doesn &apos;t . 
We love lying in lies . We love that . Do you 
all have your vitamins taken this morning ? 
Echinacea . A little antioxidant that will help you jump . 
I know you did that because the half of Americans did that every day because half of Americans do it . 
They take the stuff . And they take alternative remedies . And it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find that they &apos;re useless . 
The data records that all the time . 
They evaporate their urine more . Never do it . 
That &apos;s okay . You like 28 billion dollars for dark urine . 
I totally agree with you : 
Dark urine , dark . 
Why do we do that ? Why do we do that ? 
Well , I think I understand we hate the pharmaceutical industry . 
We hate too strong a government . We don &apos;t have confidence in the system . 
And we shouldn &apos;t have that either . Our healthcare system is bad . 
It &apos;s cruel to millions of people . 
It &apos;s absolutely amazing , cold and soul @-@ depressing , even to us who can afford it . 
So we &apos;re walking away from it . And where are we going ? 
We &apos;re walking into the arms of the placebo industry . 
That &apos;s great . I love the placebo industry . 
But you know , that &apos;s really a serious matter . Because the stuff is crap . And we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it . 
And I have all sorts of little props here , 
none of them : Gingko fraud , Echinacea fraud , Acai , I don &apos;t even know what . That &apos;s , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it . It &apos;s cheating . 
And you know what ? When I say that , people scream at me and say , &quot; What cares you ? &quot; &quot; Let people do whatever they want . &quot; That 
&apos;s how they feel . And 
you know what ? They &apos;re wrong 
because I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the Health Minister . He says , &quot; Hmm . &quot; I &apos;m going to get the evidence from my experts on mammography . Not assume . Or any cancer quack salver who will treat his patients with coffee intakes . 
If you go down that path where faith and magic , evidence and science replace , you get to a place , where you don &apos;t get to be . 
You get to Thabo Mbeki in South Africa . 
He brought 400,000 of his people around because he insisted that red beds , garlic and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs . We know they &apos;re going to be the ones that can slow down the course of AIDS . 
Hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country worse than any other country plagued by this disease . 
Please don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences . 
They have them . They always have them . 
Now , the most unwieldy epidemic we &apos;re in is this absurd fight between the advocates of genetically modified food and the advocates of the bio @-@ elite . 
This is an idiotic debate . It has to stop . 
It &apos;s a debate about words about metaphors . 
This is ideology . Not science . 
Everything we eat . Every grain of rice , every branch of parsley . Every sprouts has been changed by people . 
You know , there were no mandarin in paradise . 
There were no cantaloupe melons . There were no Christmas trees . We did all of that . 
We did it in the last 11,000 years . 
And some of it worked . And some of it didn &apos;t . 
We got rid of it . What didn &apos;t work . 
Now we can make it more accurate . And of course , there are risks . But we can do something like vitamin A in rice . And the stuff can help millions of people . Millions of people prolong their lives . 
They don &apos;t want to do that . 
I have to say , I don &apos;t understand . 
We reject genetically modified . Food . 
Why do we do that ? 
Well , what I hear all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones . Mono @-@ culture . We don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing . That &apos;s wrong . 
We don &apos;t want companies to patent lives . 
We don &apos;t want companies to own seeds . 
And you know what ? My answer to all of that is 
yes . You &apos;re right . Let &apos;s fix that . 
It &apos;s true . We have a huge food problem . But that &apos;s not science . 
That &apos;s not science . 
It &apos;s right . Moral patent crab . 
You know that science is not a company . 
It &apos;s not a country . 
It &apos;s not even an idea . It &apos;s a process . 
It &apos;s a process . And sometimes it works . And sometimes it doesn &apos;t . But the idea that we don &apos;t want science to allow it to do its work . Because we &apos;re afraid , it &apos;s a real impasse . And it keeps millions of people from flourishing . 
You know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to grow 70 percent more food than we do at the moment . 70 percent . 
That investment in Africa over the last 30 years , 
embarrassing , shameful . 
You need that . And we &apos;re not giving it to you . 
And why ? Genetically modified food . 
We don &apos;t want to encourage people . This rotten stuff to eat , like Maniok Maniok is . 
Something that half a billion people eat . 
It &apos;s about like a potato . 
It &apos;s just a bunch of calories . It &apos;s bad . 
It doesn &apos;t have nutrients . It doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists build it . All of this is inside of it . 
And then people could eat it and wouldn &apos;t become blind . 
They wouldn &apos;t starve . And you know what ? 
That would be nice . It wouldn &apos;t be Chez Panisse . But it would be nice , 
and all I can say is , why do we fight this ? 
I mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves . Why do we fight this ? 
Because we don &apos;t want to push genes around . 
It &apos;s not about pushing genes around . It &apos;s not about chemicals . 
It &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones . Our insistence on greater food , better food , unique food . 
It &apos;s not about Rice Krispies . It &apos;s about keeping people alive . And it &apos;s high time to understand what that means . 
Because you know what ? 
If we don &apos;t do that , if we keep going as we do . Let &apos;s be guilty of something we believe in , I don &apos;t want to be guilty of . High @-@ tech colonialism . 
There &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here . 
It &apos;s selfish . It &apos;s ugly . It &apos;s not worthy of us . And we really have to stop that . 
After this incredibly fun conversation , you might want to say , &quot; Do you still want to be in this ridiculous time machine ? &quot; And go to the future 
anyway . I want to do that anyway . 
She &apos;s in the present moment . But we have an incredible opportunity . 
We can put this time machine on everything we want . 
We can move it where we want to move it . And we will move it to where we want it to be . 
We need to have these conversations . And we need to think . But if we go into the time machine and go into the future , we will be happy . Having done that . 
I know we can . And as far as I &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs now . 
Thank you . 
Thank you . When Steve Lopez , columnist of the Los Angeles Times , One day through the streets in the center of Los Angeles , he heard wonderful music . 
She came from a man , an African @-@ American , sympathetic , rough , homeless , who was playing on a violin that had only two strings left . 
Many of you will know the story , because from Steve &apos;s articles about it , later on , a book was filmed . With Robert Downey Junior , when Steve Lopez and Jamie Foxx , when Nathaniel Anthony Ayers , the contrabass player who studied at the Juilliard Conservatory , and his promising career . Tragically early on , his paranoid schizophrenia ended . 
Nathaniel left Juilliard , suffered a nervous breakdown , and 30 years later , he lived as homeless on the streets of Skid Row . In the center of Los Angeles 
I recommend to you all to read Steves &apos; book or watch the movie so that you can not only understand the wonderful connection that exists between these two men , but also how the music , these connections , make . Helped and how they eventually were the instrument , if this play of words is allowed , that &apos;s half the way . Nathaniel , away from the street , getting away . 
I met Mr. Ayers . In 2008 , two years ago , in the Walt Disney Concert Hall . 
He just had a demonstration of Beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and he came behind the stage to imagine myself . 
He spoke in a very cheerful and sociable tone about yo @-@ yo . MA : And Hillary Clinton , and about how the Dodgers never made it into the Baseball World Series . And all of this because of the insidious passage . The first violin in the last sentence of Beethoven &apos;s Fourth Symphony . 
We came up with the theme of &quot; Music &quot; and a few days later , I got an email saying that Nathaniel was in favor of violin lessons with me . 
I have to mention that Nathaniel is opposed to medical treatment , because he was already in the process of electroshocks and thorazine and handcuffs . A trauma that his entire life has 
followed him as a result of is now particularly vulnerable . For these schizophrenic phases . They &apos;re sometimes so bad that they tear him apart . And he disappears for days . In the streets of Skid Row , this horror is always wandering around and the torturing of his own mind . 
And in just such a charming stage , Nathaniel was when we were in our first lesson at the Walt Disney Concert Hall . He had this crazy flicker in his eyes and he was totally lost . 
He talked about invisible demons and smoke and about how someone in sleep poisoned him . 
I was afraid not for me , but I was afraid I could lose him , that he could lose him , that he could sink into one of his states , and that I could destroy his relationship with the violin . When I started talking about clay ladders and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy . 
So I just started playing . 
I played the first movement of Beethoven &apos;s violin concerto . 
And as I played , I noticed that in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes , a complete change was taking place . 
It was as if under the influence of an invisible doctor &apos;s nei . A chemical reaction , whose catalyst was my game , 
Nathaniel &apos;s maniac anger , turned into understanding , into a calm curiosity and grace . 
And as if by a miracle , he took his violin and began to listen . Some excerpts of violin concerts to play , and then asked me to finish playing them . Mendelssohn Chaikovsky , Sibelius . 
We started then to talk about music . From Bach to Beethoven , Brahms , Bruckner and all the other BS from BartÃ³k to Beethoven , from Esa @-@ Pekka Salonen . 
And I realized that he wasn &apos;t just an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but he had it with her . Also , a close personal relationship . 
He talked about her with passion and understanding that I would otherwise only talk about my colleagues in the Philharmonic , of Los Angeles , by sharing with him music 
and playing about music and talking about music , was out of this paranoid confused . Man who was just walking through the streets of Los Angeles . A kind , educated , excellent musician trained in Juilliard . 
Music is medicine . Music changes us . 
For Nathaniel , music means mental health . 
Because music allows him to express his thoughts and delusions with the help of imagination and creativity into something real . 
And so he escapes his tormenting state . 
I understood that that was the essence of art . 
Exactly . That &apos;s why we make music so that we can do something within all of us deep inside , deep inside . Our emotions through our artistic lens , through our creativity , can shape into reality . 
And the reality of that expression reaches us all , moving , inspiring and uniting us . 
What Nathaniel was doing , the music brought him back to a community of friends . 
The redeeming power of music brought him back to a family of musicians who understood him . He recognized his talent and respected him , 
and I &apos;m going to play with Nathaniel again and again . Whether in the Walt Disney Concert Hall or in Skid Row , because he reminds me of why I &apos;m becoming a musician . 
Thank you very much . 
Bruno Giussani : Thank you very much . Thank you . 
Robert Gupta : 
Robert Gupta : I want to play something that I shamefully stolen from the cellist . 
I hope you will forgive me . 
I &apos;m Jane McGonigal . I design computer games . 
I &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years now . And my goal for the next decade is to be just as easy to make . The world in reality to save as it is in online games to 
save . I have a plan for that . I want to convince more people , including all of you , more time playing bigger and more amazing games . 
We &apos;re spending three billion hours a week now playing online . 
Some of you may think , &quot; This is a lot of time for games . 
Maybe a little too much time . &quot; If you think about how many problems we &apos;re facing in the real world urgently , we need to solve them . In 
fact , but my research at the Institute for the Future suggests that &apos;s exactly the opposite . Right ? 
Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to address the world &apos;s most pressing problems . 
In fact , I am convinced that if we look at the next century on this planet , we want to have to dramatically increase that time . 
I calculated that the time needed was 21 billion hours of playing time . That &apos;s 
per week . That seems a little bit absurd first , maybe . So I &apos;ll repeat it with that . It can work if we can have problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , I think we need to try . Play online for at least 21 billion hours a week until the end of the next decade . 
No . I mean , it &apos;s really serious . 
Why ? This picture 
is pretty accurate . Why ? I think games are so vital to the survival of the human species in the future . Serious . 
This is a portrait of photographer Phil Toledano . 
He wanted to capture the feelings of playing . So he &apos;s in front of the players , he &apos;s built a camera . 
This is one of the classic expressions . 
When playing , if you &apos;re not a player , you may miss some of the nuances . In this picture , 
you probably see this sense of urgency . Something scared . But also extreme concentration , deeply deepened . In solving a really difficult problem . 
If you play , you &apos;ll see some nuances up here , the eyes pulled upwards . And the mouth is a sign of optimism . The eyebrows show surprise . 
This is a player on the edge of what &apos;s called an epic . Victory : 
Oh , you know that ? 
OK . Great . So we have some players here , 
an epic . Victory is a result that &apos;s so very positive that it &apos;s not known before that it was possible at all . 
It was almost beyond imagination . And if you get there , you &apos;re shocked that you &apos;re actually capable of doing 
that . This is an epical victory . 
These players are about to win an epic victory . 
And this is what we see on millions of faces of problem solvers around the world . If we can see the hurdles of the next century , the face of those who face the edge of an epic victory 
, against all odds . Well , unfortunately , we see this face in real life . If we face difficult problems , 
I call it that , in life , I &apos;m bad face . 
And it &apos;s actually my face . See , yeah . OK . 
That &apos;s me . How I &apos;m in life , I &apos;m bad face . Do 
this . This is a graffiti in my former home country in Berkeley , California , where I studied in my PhD thesis . Why do we do better in games than in real life ? 
This is a problem . This is a problem that many players have . 
We think in reality we &apos;re not as good as in games . And 
I mean , not only less successful . Although that &apos;s part of it , 
we do more in games . 
I mean , good in terms of motivation to do something meaningful . Inspired in collaboration with each other . 
If we &apos;re in a game world , I think many of us are in our best version , at any time and immediately , helpful , persistent to solve the problem . Try trying as long as necessary , after the failure , to try again . 
And in reality , if we fail , if we encounter obstacles , we often feel different . We feel overwhelmed . 
We feel ourselves . We feel defeated , we feel threatened . Maybe depressed . Frustrated , right ? Cynical ? 
We never have those feelings . When we play games in games , they just don &apos;t exist . 
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m studying as a PhD student . 
Why is it in games ? It &apos;s impossible to think . You couldn &apos;t just achieve everything . 
How can we get those feelings out of games to reality ? 
So I looked at games like &quot; World of Warcraft , &quot; which is the ideal environment for solving problems in a community . 
And I noticed a few things . The epic victories in online worlds . 
So make it possible first , if you &apos;re going to join one of these online games , especially at World of Warcraft , there are a lot of different characters ready to give you a world saving mission . And that immediately . 
But not just any mission , but a mission . Perfect for your current level in the game . 
Right ? So you can do that . 
You never get a task that you can &apos;t solve . 
But always on the edge of your skills , so you have to make an effort . 
But there &apos;s no unemployment . In World of Warcraft , you &apos;re not sitting around and turning around demons . There are always something very specific about doing important . And 
there are , in a way , 
employees wherever they go . Hundreds of thousands of people working with them to do their epic mission . 
So , to conclude . We have that in real life . Not so easy . This feeling that , when you have a fingercut , you have employees who are willing to do it in a way . 
And there &apos;s this epic story . This inspiring story , why we &apos;re there . And what we have to do is we get this whole positive feedback . 
You &apos;ve certainly got from level up and 1 strength , or 1 intelligence . 
This constant feedback is not in real life . 
If I leave this stage , I don &apos;t have 1 speech and 1 crazy idea . 20 . Crazy idea . 
I get real life . This feedback , not . 
So the problem of collaborative online worlds like World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying . Anytime on the brink of an epic victory , that we prefer to be on the brink of our entire life in these games . 
They &apos;re just better than reality . 
To date , all World of Warcraft players together have 5.93 million years spent virtual problems with the virtual problems of Azeroth . 
That &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing . 
It may sound bad . But let &apos;s just look 
at it in context : 5.93 million years ago , it started . Our first primate ancestors started walking upright . 
The first upright primacy . 
So OK . So when we talk about how much time we have to spend playing games right now , that just makes sense . When you spend time with regard to the scale of human development before you think about it . What &apos;s extraordinary , 
but also appropriate . Because it turns out that by doing this whole time , we &apos;re using it all on play , actually changing it . What we as humans are able to do ? 
We &apos;re becoming too community . Thinking , heartfelt beings . 
That &apos;s the truth . That &apos;s what I believe in . 
Look at it . These interesting statistics , which were recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University . The average young person today in a country with a strong playing culture spends . 10,000 hours playing online until the age of 21 . 
So 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of two reasons . 
First of all , for kids in the United States , 10,080 hours is the exact total time they spend in school , from fifth grade to fifth grade , when they finish high school . If you never miss it , 
so here we have a complete parallel education path where young people are . The same way we learn what it means . A good player , like anything else you &apos;re in school , learning . And maybe 
some of you have the new book by Malcolm Gladwell . Overflying . So you know his theory of success . The theory of success of 10,000 hours . 
It &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science that if we spend 10,000 hours with laborious study of any subject , up to the age of 21 , we will master . In it , 
we will be so good at it . Whatever to do , like the most important people in the world . 
So what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are master players , and 
so the big question is , what exactly are players ? Masterfully good . Because 
if we could figure out that out , we would have , kind of , never before , ever @-@ known human potential at our disposal . 
So many people we have in the world right now , who have at least an hour a day playing online . 
These are our master players , 500 million people . These are extraordinary . Good . There are some . 
And in the next decade , we have another billion players , who are exceptionally good at whatever . 
If you haven &apos;t heard it yet , 
the game industry is developing consoles that save energy . And on mobile networks , instead of broadband Internet , they &apos;re working . So players around the world , especially in India . China , Brazil , playing online , 
you can expect . An additional billion players over the next decade . 
So we &apos;ve got a total of 1.5 billion players . 
So I started thinking about what it is . What these games are doing to us . 
Here are the four things I found . First , urgency optimism . 
OK . Imagine how extreme self @-@ motivation . 
Urgent optimism is desire to do something right away . Mastering a hurdle , along with believing that we have a reasonable hope of success . 
Players always believe that an epical victory is possible and that it is always worth it , it &apos;s worth trying . 
And that &apos;s the same : Players don &apos;t sit around . 
Players are champions in spiders . Poet social networks . 
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research . They show that we like people more . After we played with them , even if they beat us badly . 
The reason for that is that there &apos;s a lot of trust that it takes to play a game with someone . 
We trust that somebody has time to spend with us , that the rules are being respected , that we have the same goal . And up to the end of the game . So that &apos;s where the 
game is allowed to play together . The growth of ties , trust and cooperation . 
As a result , we build stronger social relationships , happy 
productivity . Fantastic . 
You know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of Warcraft players plays 22 hours a week . So , part @-@ time job . 
The reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier at working hard . As if we relax or do nothing . 
We know that we as human beings function optimally . When we do hard , significant work , 
and players are always ready to work hard . When they get the right job and 
eventually epic meaning , 
players love it , part awe . Adorer Missions of planetary dimensions Here &apos;s a 
background information to get this right . You probably know all Wikipedia . The biggest Wiki in the world . The 
second largest Wiki in the world with almost 80,000 entries is : The World of Warcraft Wiki : 
Five million people use it every month . 
They have more information about World of Warcraft . Collected online than about any other topic in any other Wiki that &apos;s in the world . 
They create an epic story . 
They create an epic source of knowledge about the World of Warcraft . 
OK . So these are four superpowers that are able to produce a single result . Players are super @-@ powerful , hopeful individuals . 
They &apos;re human beings . They believe that as individuals , they can change the world . 
And the only problem is they believe . They can change the virtual worlds . But not the real ones . 
That &apos;s the problem I &apos;m trying to solve . 
Edward Castronova is a scientist , and 
his work is brilliant . 
He &apos;s studying . Why people spend so much time , energy and money on online worlds ? 
And he says , &quot; We &apos;re witnessing nothing less than mass emigration to virtual worlds . &quot; And online gaming environments , 
and this by an economist , so he &apos;s logical . 
And he doesn &apos;t say the way I do . I develop games . I &apos;m a little bit exuberant . 
So he says , &quot; That actually makes sense . &quot; Because players can achieve more in online worlds than in real life . 
They can play games with stronger social ties than they do in real life . They get more feedback and rewards . In games than in real life , 
so he says , &quot; It &apos;s perfectly logical right now that players have more time in the virtual world than in real life . 
&quot; I agree . That &apos;s logical . 
But it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation . 
We have to start to put the real world into a game . 
My inspiration comes from an event . The 2nd . 500 years . It &apos;s back . 
There are these ancient cubes . Sheepcrumbs . You know , 
before these fantastic game econtrollers , there were sheep &apos;s necks . 
And these were , so to speak , the first people to develop . Play equipment . And if you &apos;re working with the works of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus . You may know ? This story , the story about how and why games were invented . 
According to Herodotus , games became more accurate craps in the kingdom of Lydia . During a famine 
, there was supposedly such a great famine that the king of Lydia was turning into a crazy idea , right 
? People suffered , people fought . 
It was an extreme situation . It took an extreme solution . 
So they invented , according to Herodotus . The dice game and agreed a national strategy . In one day , you would eat . The next day you would play . 
And they would play so much deeper into the dice game . There are games so fascinating and satisfying , happy productivity that surround us that they would forget that there &apos;s nothing to eat . 
And then the next day you would play . And the next day you would eat . 
And according to Herodotus , they survived for 18 years . This famine by living in one day and eating the next 
, playing the next , I think , we &apos;re going to do the same . Today 
we &apos;re going to play . We &apos;re going to play games to help the suffering of the real world . We &apos;re going to play games to escape everything that &apos;s happening in the real world . Everything that &apos;s not satisfying in real life . And we &apos;re going to get what we need . From the games . 
But that doesn &apos;t have to be the end . 
That &apos;s the exciting thing . 
According to Herodotus , after 18 years of famine , it wasn &apos;t getting any better . So the king decided to start a final dice game . 
They shared the kingdom . In two halves . 
They played a dice game . And the winners were allowed to be an epic adventure . 
They left lydia and they got up in search of a new home . They just left so many people back as food to survive . And they went with the rest to find an area where they could thrive . 
That sounds crazy , right ? 
But the latest DNA evidence shows that the Etruscans , who later formed the Roman Empire , The same DNA as the ancient Lydians , have . 
So scientists recently came to the conclusion that herodotus , crazy story , is actually true . 
And geologists found evidence of global cooling that lasted almost 20 years , which explains famine , right ? So 
this crazy story could be true . Maybe 
they actually have their people saved by playing by 18 years of saving themselves in games , by playing . And then they had this inspiration , and so much learned about playing with each other that it would save the entire civilization . 
So we can . 
We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft since 1994 . 
This was the first real @-@ time strategy game . The World of Warcraft series . 
This was 16 years ago . 
They played craps for 18 years . We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft for 16 years . 
I &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic . Game . 
So they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world . So I &apos;m taking my 21 billion hours of play a week . 
We should agree that half of us are one hour a day with games , right ? Until we solve the problems of the real 
world . I know you &apos;re going to ask , how do we solve problems ? The real world in games . And 
that &apos;s exactly the question I &apos;ve been asking about in recent years at the Institute for the Future . 
We &apos;ve got this banner in our office in Palo Alto . It expresses how we understand the future . 
We don &apos;t want to try to tell the future 
what we want before . Is the future to 
be created ? We want to imagine the best possible outcome . And then empower people to empower this idea to become reality . 
We face epic victories and give people the opportunity to make it happen . 
I &apos;ll show you three games very briefly that I designed to try and make people epic victories . In their own future , 
this is world without oil . 
The game is 2007 . 
It &apos;s an online game where you overcome oil shortages . 
Oil shortages are invented . But we have enough online content to make it realistic for you . And you actually , your real life without oil . So if you sign up to the game , tell us where you live . And then you get real @-@ time news movies showing you how much oil costs , what there is not . How food supplies are affected , 
how transport is . Whether schools are closed , whether there are riots . And you have to figure out how to shape your real life . If it were true , and we ask you to blog about it , to hire videos or photos . 
We have this 1,700 @-@ player game in 2007 . And we &apos;ve been testing it since then for the last three years . 
And I can tell you it was a changing experience . 
Nobody wants to change their lives because it &apos;s good for the environment . Or ... Because we should . 
But if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and you &apos;re told , &quot; We &apos;re going to get oil out . 
&quot; This is a fascinating adventure you &apos;re going to go to . 
Find out how you would survive . Most of our players have learned the habits of the game . So we &apos;ve 
chosen the next world saving game . A bigger , higher goal than just oil shortages . 
We &apos;ve got the Superstruct game at the Institute for the Future . 
The starting point is to calculate a supercomputer that people only have 23 years on the planet left . 
This supercomputer is called Global . Existence / Sensitization System . Of course , 
the call to players to sign up . Do we have almost designed a Jerry Bruckheimer movie ? 
You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies , where there &apos;s the dream team . You have the astronaut , the scientist , the ex @-@ StrÃ¤fling , and just together . Can you save the world ? 
But in our game . Instead of just five people , we say , &quot; Everyone is on the dream team . &quot; And it &apos;s our job . The future for energy , food , health , safety and the future of social justice . 
8,000 players played the game . For eight weeks . 
They found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read . If you Google Superstruct and bring 
the last game , we will be out on March 3 . It &apos;s a game in collaboration with the World Bank . 
If you complete the game , you get the World Bank award for social . Reformer @ 2010 graduation . 
We work with universities across sub @-@ Saharan Africa and invite you to learn how to redesign socially . 
We have a comic book on this . We have levels high for regional understanding . Knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and ingenuity . 
I want to invite you all to play this game with young people . Everywhere in the world , especially in development areas . They benefit from this together , their own social ventures to imagine the world to save . 
Now I &apos;m going to finish . 
I want to ask you something : 
What do you think is happening ? 
Next . We have all these fantastic players . We have games that show us what we can do . But we have the real world not yet saved . 
Well , I hope you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , in real life . And that games matter a lot about change . 
We have all these superpowers , happy productivity . The ability to build tight social networks , urgency optimism . And the desire for epiepical meaning . 
I really hope that together we play important games to play on this planet for another century to survive . 
And I hope you will play with me and design and play these games . 
When I look forward to the next decade , I &apos;m sure about two things : That we create every imaginable future and that we can create all kinds of games . So I say , let &apos;s play the world @-@ changing games . Let &apos;s start . 
Thank you . 
For some time now , I &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect . It may seem strange that a magician is interested in it . Unless you look at it like me , it &apos;s a deception that leads to something real . If someone is just firmly enough to believe in it , 
in other words , have sugar pills . In some studies , a measurable effect has been the placebo effect , and that &apos;s just because of it . Because the person thinks what happens to her is . A pharmaceutical or some kind of pain management . For example , if the patient is only stuck enough to believe in it , there &apos;s a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect . 
A deception becomes something real because someone like this perceives it so 
that we can understand each other . Now I &apos;m going to show you a basic , very simple magic trick . 
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . This is a trick that has been in every magic book for kids since at least the 1950s . 
I myself have taken it from the Cub Scout Magic . The scout scout in the 1970s . 
I &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it to you . 
And then I &apos;m going to explain why I explain it . 
So you see what happens . 
The knife you can look at . My hand you can look at . 
I &apos;m just going to look at the knife in my fist . 
I &apos;m going to push my sleeves back . 
And to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeves or comes out of it , I &apos;m just going to push my wrist right here . 
So you can see that there &apos;s no time anything moving around . As long as I &apos;m pressurizing here , nothing can go in my sleeves or come out . 
And the goal is very simple . 
I &apos;m going to open my hand . And hopefully if everything goes well , the knife will go through my bare physical magnetism . 
It &apos;s actually so tight . It &apos;s in its place that I can shake it without the knife falling down . Nothing moves . 
In my sleeves , or comes out , no trickery . And you can study everything . 
TA @-@ DA : 
Well , this is a trick I often teach small kids who are interested in magic . Because you can learn a lot about deception . If you look more closely , even though it &apos;s a very easy @-@ to @-@ do trick . 
I think many of you here in the room know . This trick , 
it works like this . 
I hold the knife . In my hand , 
I say I close my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or comes out . And this is a lie . 
The reason I hold my wrist is because it contains the actual secret of the illusion of illusion . 
The moment I close my hand from you , so that you turn it from behind , it moves . This finger , my index finger , just moves from where it was to a position where it was stretched out like this . 
Great trick at 
the back . Is there somebody who had no childhood ? 
So he &apos;s right here . 
And when I turn around , the finger changes its position . 
And now you could talk about why this is a deception . Why not realize that down here , only three fingers are visible , because the mind and the way in which it &apos;s processing information , they &apos;re not counting individually . One , two , three , but seeing them as a group . 
But that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about . Now here . Actually not at all . And then I open my hand . 
Of course , it &apos;s held there . But not by the magnetism of my body , but by a trick , by my index finger , which is there now . 
And when I close my hand , the same thing happens : By turning back , this movement hides the finger that the finger moves back . 
I take this hand away . And here &apos;s the knife . 
This trick you can use to show your friends and neighbors . Thank you . 
Now , what about the placebo effect ? A year ago or so , 
I read a study that really cut me around . 
I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher . And that &apos;s why for me , this was an amazing thing . Because what 
it turned out to be is this . If you had a placebo in the form of a white pill , in the form of an aspirin tablet , it &apos;s just a round of white pill that has a certain measurable effect . 
But if you have the shape in which you give placebo , for example , into a smaller pill , change it . And you color that blue and you embosse a letter on it , it &apos;s actually measurable , more effective . 
And that , though none of them are any pharmaceutical . They &apos;re just sugar pills . 
But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill . 
What made me really freak out of 
that ? But it turned out that &apos;s not all that . 
If you take capsules , they &apos;re even more effective than tablets . Any shape , 
a colored capsule , yellow at one end . And red at the other end is better than a white capsule . 
Dosage also plays a role : A 
pill twice a day is not as good as three pills . I can &apos;t get into the exact statistics now . Remember ? 
Sorry . The key thing 
. But is that dosage also plays a role . 
And the shape plays a role . 
And if you have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to grab the needle . 
Right ? A syringe with an ineffective one , a few milliliters , an ineffective substance that you inject into a patient . 
This creates a very strong image . In your head , this is much stronger than a white pill . 
This graph is really . I &apos;m going to show you another time . If we have a projector , 
the fact is that the white pill isn &apos;t working as well as the blue pill . Pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle . 
And none of this has any really pharmaceutical property . It &apos;s just our belief in that , which has a stronger effect in us . 
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a magic trick . 
I take something that is obviously a deception , and I make it look real . 
We know from that study that you can grab a needle . If you want to get to the point , 
this is an 18 @-@ inch @-@ long needle . It &apos;s very , very sharp . And I &apos;m going to sterilize it a little bit first . 
This is really my flesh . It &apos;s not Damian &apos;s special farmed meat . 
This is my skin . This is not a special effect . Hollywood . 
I &apos;m going to put this needle in my skin and through it , until it goes on the other side , and it goes out again . 
If it gets you bad , if you fall slightly powerless . I have a couple of friends . Last night . Shown in the hotel room . And some people I didn &apos;t know , and there &apos;s a woman almost powerless . 
So I propose , if you get sick quickly , look for the next 30 seconds , away . Or ... You know what ? I &apos;m going to get the first delicate part back here . 
You can do it in a moment . You can see , but you can also look away . So if you want 
, it &apos;s going to be right here where my meat starts . On the lower part of my arm , I &apos;m just going to make a little bit of a break . 
I &apos;m really sorry . Is it crazy ? And now 
, just a little bit through my skin . And on the other side , just get 
out again . Now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had with the knife trick . 
About , 
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers . Or ... So I 
&apos;m going to show you . This is one , two , three , four , five . 
Well , 
I know what people think . If you see this , 
you say , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s probably not so stupid . &quot; And it &apos;s just sticking through the skin to just let us know for a few minutes . 
Well , then I &apos;ll show you . 
What does this look like ? Very good . 
Yes . I know . And people back there say , &quot; Okay . &quot; I didn &apos;t really see that . People 
in the adjoining rooms are now coming in , 
let me tell you from near . This is 
really my skin . This is not a special effect . 
Hollywood . This is my flesh . And I can turn this around . 
Sorry . If you &apos;re getting bad , look away . Don &apos;t look at it . 
People in the back , or those who sometime later see this on video , will say , &quot; Well , yeah . &quot; That looks right . Impressive . But if it were real , he would see , &quot; Here &apos;s a hole . &quot; And there , if it was really real , it would bleed . Okay . 
Let me add a little blood to you . 
Squeeze out , yeah . Here it is . 
Normally , I would take out the needle now . 
I would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds there . 
But I think in this frame here and with the intention of delusion , something real , real will I do , I &apos;ll just put the needle in there . And so , from the stage , 
we &apos;ll go in the next few days a few more times . 
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . Thank you very much . 
So I &apos;ve had a lot of fish in my life . 
I just loved two . 
This first one was more like a passionate affair . 
It was a beautiful fish . It was tasty . Good consistency . Hold . Best seller . 
On the menu . 
What else better fish . It became aquaculture after the supposedly highest standards of sustainability . 
So you could feel comfortable growing it for sale . 
I had a relationship with this beauty for several months . 
One day , the company &apos;s CEO called and asked , &quot; Would I be able to speak at an event about the sustainability of the farm ? 
&quot; Of course , I said , 
&quot; Here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem had become for our chefs . How do we keep fish on our menus ? 
&quot; Over the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the seas , we &apos;ve been barking forests . 
It &apos;s hard to overstate destruction : 
90 percent of the big fish we love . The tuna , the curative butte , the salmon , the swordfish . They &apos;ve collapsed . 
It &apos;s almost nothing left . 
So , aquaculture is likely to become bad or bad . Fish growing . Part of our future . 
Many arguments against it : Fish farming plants pollute the environment . Most of them . Anyway . And they &apos;re inefficient . Let &apos;s take tuna at a great disadvantage . 
It &apos;s got 15 percent feed recovery . One . 
That means : 15 pounds . Wild fish are needed to get one pound of farmed tuna . 
Not very sustainable tastes 
very good either . 
So here was finally a company . It tried to get it right . 
I wanted to support it . 
The day before the event , I called the public relations chief for the company . 
Let &apos;s call him . 
Don Don , I just said . Just to get the facts . Right ? You &apos;re famous for that . So far out in the sea , you don &apos;t pollute the environment 
. That &apos;s true , he said . We &apos;re so far out there that the waste is distributed by our fish , not concentrated . And 
then he added . We &apos;re basically a world of our own . 
This 2.5 percent feed recovery to one , he said , 
&quot; The best in the industry . &quot; 
2.5 to one , great 2.5 
to one , what feeds ? Your 
sustainable proteins , he said . 
&quot; Great , &quot; I said , &quot; I got up , 
and that evening I lay in bed and thought , &quot; What the hell is a sustainable protein ? 
&quot; So the next day , I called . Shortly before the Don event . 
I said , &quot; Don , what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot; 
He said , &quot; He doesn &apos;t know . &quot; He &apos;s going to ask . 
Well , I telephoned a few people in the company . Nobody could give me a good answer . Until I finally got on the phone with the leading biologist , 
we call him the same . 
Don Don , I said , &quot; What , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot; 
Well , he mentioned some algae . And some fishmeal . And then he said , &quot; Chicken pellets . &quot; 
I said , &quot; Chicken pellets . &quot; 
He said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; Feathers , skin . &quot; &quot; Bone flour . &quot; &quot; Remnants dried . &quot; And processed into food . 
I said , &quot; How much percent of your food is chicken ? &quot; 
Assuming maybe two percent ? 
Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said . 
I said , &quot; Don , what &apos;s sustainable about feeding chicken to fish ? &quot; 
There was a long break in the pipeline . And he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . 
I fell in love with that fish . 
No . Not because I &apos;m a self @-@ righteous connoisseur and a good man . 
That &apos;s me , even . 
No . I &apos;m actually not in love with this fish because I swear to God , the fish after this conversation , after having tasted chicken . 
This second fish . This is another kind of love story . 
It &apos;s the romantic species , the way you ever better love your fish , the better you get to know your fish , the more you love the fish . 
I first put it in a restaurant in southern Spain . 
A friend journalist had long been talking about this fish . 
She kind of cuddled us . 
He came on the table with a bright one . Almost shimmering . White one . 
Color . The cook had cooked it . 
Hold twice . 
Amazingly , he was still delicious . 
Who can make a fish ? So good to taste after it was cooked . 
I can &apos;t . But this guy can call 
it Miguel . In fact , he &apos;s called Miguel , 
and no . He doesn &apos;t cook the fish . And he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way you and I understand it . 
He &apos;s a biologist at Veta La Palma . 
This is a fish rearing in the southwest corner . Spain , 
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river Guadalquivir , 
until the 1980s . The farm in the hands of Argentines . 
They grew meat cattle on what basically were wetlands . 
They did this by draining the land . 
They built this complicated sequence of canals . And they pushed water out of the country and out . In the river . 
Well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not be economically 
and environmentally , it was a disaster . 
It brought about 90 percent of the birds around . What a place that was there . Many birds are . 
And so in 1982 , a Spanish company with environmental awareness . It bought the land . 
What did they do ? 
They bought the river of water in reverse . 
They literally laid the lever . 
Instead of pushing the water out , they used the channels to get the water back . 
They flooded the channels . 
They created an 11,000 hectares of fish rearing : Perch , sea ash , shrimp , eel . And so Miguel . And his company , the ecological destruction , completely reversed . 
The farm is incredible . 
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this . 
They &apos;re staring out onto the horizon of a million miles away . And everything you see are flooded canals . And this dense , lush march . 
I was there , not long ago , with Miguel . 
He &apos;s an incredible guy . Three parts . Charles Darwin . And one part , a crocodile for kissing . 
Okay . There we were , and we fought through wetlands . And I chash and sweat , I have mud up to my knees , and Miguel keeps calm . A biology lecture 
here , he highlights a rare track . 
Now he mentions the mineral needs of phytoplankton . 
And here he sees a pattern of bundles that will put him on Tanzanian giraffe . 
It turns out Miguel has the biggest part of his career in Mikumi National Park in Africa , where he &apos;s been . 
I asked him how he could become a fish expert . 
He said , &quot; Fish , I don &apos;t know about fish . 
I &apos;m an expert in relationships . And 
then he goes and falls into more talk about rare birds and algae . And strange aquatic plants , 
and don &apos;t get me wrong . &quot; That was really fascinating . You know , the biotic community , unplugged , in the way 
it &apos;s great . But I was in love . 
And my head got weak about this cooked piece of delicious fish that I had on the eve . 
So I interrupted it . I said , &quot; Miguel . &quot; How is it that your fish tastes so good ? He 
pointed to algae . 
I know boy , the algae of phytoplankton . The relationships This is incredible . 
But what do your fish eat ? 
How is the recycling of feed ? Well 
, he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eat what they eat in the wild , what they would eat . 
The plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton . That &apos;s what the fish feed . 
The system is so healthy . It &apos;s completely self @-@ explanatory . 
There &apos;s no food . 
Ever from a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , 
later on the day I drove . On this plot with Miguel around . And I asked him . I said , &quot; For a place that seems so natural , unlike any farm on the farm I &apos;ve ever been . How do you measure success ? &quot; 
At the moment , it was as if a film director had demanded a change of stage . 
And we bowed around the corner and we were offered the most incredible sight . Thousands and thousands of pinkers flamingos , literally pinker carpet . As far as the eye can see , 
that &apos;s success . He said , 
&quot; Look at their bellies . &quot; Pink . 
They &apos;re smuggling , slugging 
. I was completely confused . 
I said , &quot; Miguel , don &apos;t smuggle your fish . &quot; 
Yes , he said . 
&quot; We &apos;re losing 20 percent of our fish . &quot; And fish eggs to the birds . 
Now , last year , 600,000 people were more than 250,000 birds on this site . 
It &apos;s the biggest one today . And one of the most important private bird reserves in Europe . 
I said , &quot; Miguel is a well @-@ thriving bird population , not . The last one you have to have on a fish rearing . &quot; 
He shook his head . No . 
He said , &quot; We &apos;re building extensively , not intensively . 
This is an ecological network . 
The flamingos eat the shrimps , 
the shrimps eat the phytoplankton the pinker . 
&quot; So the belly , the better . The system . Okay 
. Let &apos;s think about that . A farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals . And a farm that can succeed in its predators &apos; health . 
A fish rearing , but also a bird reserve . 
Oh , and by the way , these flamingos shouldn &apos;t even be there from the outset . 
They breed 240 kilometers away in a city where soil quality is better . For nest maintenance 
every morning , they fly 240 kilometers to the farm . 
And they fly every night . They fly 240 kilometers back . 
They do that because they &apos;re on the beaten white line of the A92 highway . 
Seriously . 
I had a kind of trip of penguins . So I looked at Miguel . 
I said Miguel . Fly them . 240 kilometers . The farm , and then fly them . 240 kilometers back . In the 
evening , they do that for the kids . He 
looked at me as if I had just heard a song by Whitney Houston . 
He said , &quot; No . &quot; They do that . Because the food is better . 
I don &apos;t have the skin of my beloved fish mentioned . It was delicious , and I don &apos;t like the skin of fish . I don &apos;t like it sucked . I don &apos;t like it crispy . 
It &apos;s this biting , charred taste . 
I almost never cook with it . And 
yet , when I put it in this restaurant in southern Spain , it didn &apos;t look like the skin of fish at all . 
It tasted sweet and pure as if you were eating a bite from the ocean . 
I mentioned that to Miguel . And he nodded . 
He said , &quot; The skin looks like a sponge . 
It &apos;s the last defense before anything in the body enters . 
&quot; She &apos;s been evolving over the course of evolution to suck up impurities . And 
then he added , &quot; But our water has no impurities . Okay 
. A farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish . A farm that measures its success in the success of its predators . 
&quot; And then I realized when he said , &quot; A farm that doesn &apos;t have impurities , it undermines enormously . &quot; Because the water that flows through this farm comes from the Guadalquivir River . 
It &apos;s a river that connects all these things with all the rivers that are now prone to it , with them , to lead . Chemical pollutants : Outflow of pesticides . 
And if it goes through the system and this one leaves , it &apos;s cleaner than the water it came in , and it &apos;s cleaner than it has come in . 
The system is so healthy . It cleans the water . 
So not only a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals . Not only a farm that is successful in the health of its predators , but a farm that literally measures a water treatment plant . And not only for these fish , but also for you . And me . 
Because when the water flows out , it sinks into the Atlantic , 
a drop in the ocean . I know . But I take it . And you should do that . Because this love story , however romantic , is also instructive . 
You could say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food . Whether we &apos;re talking about meat or perch , 
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , of one where food is . In fact , it tastes good . 
But for many people , it &apos;s a little too radical . 
We &apos;re not realists . We enjoy . We &apos;re lovers . 
We love weekly markets . We love little ones . Family farms . We talk about regional food . We eat . Bio . 
And if you claim that &apos;s the things that are the future of good food insurance . Someone somewhere up and says , &quot; Hey guys , I love pinke flamingos . &quot; But how are you going to feed the world ? How 
are you going to feed the world ? 
Can I be honest . 
I like this question . Not . 
No . Not . Because we &apos;re already producing enough calories to feed the world more than just feed . 
A billion people will starve today . 
A billion . That &apos;s more than ever before . Because of stark inequalities in distribution , not total production . 
Well , I don &apos;t like this question because it &apos;s the logic of our food system that has been going on for the last 50 years . 
Feed grain to vegetable eaters , pesticides to monocultures , chemicals to the Earth , chicken to fish , and all the time , the agricultural industry has just asked . If we feed more people cheaper , how horrible can that be ? That 
was the reason . It was the justification . It was the business plan of American agriculture . 
We should call it what it is . A liquidation business , a business that quickly takes up ecological capital , which allows that very production . 
That &apos;s not a business . And it &apos;s not agriculture . 
Our grain chamber is threatened today , not because of decreasing supply , but because of decreasing resources . 
Not by the latest Moravian and Tractor inventions , but by fertile land . Not by pumps , but by fresh water , not by chainsaws , but by forests . And not by fishing boats . And nets , but by fish in the sea . They 
want to feed the world . 
Let &apos;s start with the question . How are we going to feed ourselves , 
or better ? How can we create conditions that enable each community to feed itself to feed that 
to do ? Don &apos;t look at the agricultural industrial model for the future . 
It &apos;s really old . And it &apos;s done . 
Capital , chemistry and machines are at the top of it . And it never has anything really good to eat . 
Instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model . 
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve had two billion years of work experience . 
Look at Miguel . Farmers like Miguel , 
farms that don &apos;t have worlds for themselves . Farmers that restore . Instead of using up farms that grow extensively . Instead of just intensive farmers who are not just producers , but experts in relationships . 
Because they are the ones who are experts on taste . 
And if I &apos;m really honest , they &apos;re a better cook . When I ever will be , 
you know , I &apos;m right . Because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious . 
Thank you . 
I grew up with a lot of science fiction 
in my school days , and I was driving to school by bus every day , an hour per way . And my 
nose was always in a book , a science fiction book . That &apos;s what kidnapped my thoughts into other worlds and narratives . My deep , insatiable curiosity , deep inside me , satisfied 
this curiosity , also proved to be that whenever I &apos;m not in school , I was always strolling through the woods , wandering and sampling , frogs and snakes and beetles . And pond water brought everything home . And under the microscope , 
I looked at it . I was totally excited about science . 
You know , it was always about trying to get the world . And the limits of what is possible , 
and my love of science . Fiction seemed to reflect in my environment . Because back in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea , 
Jacques Cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating shows that brought us animals and places and a world full of wonders that we never would have imagined before . 
So that &apos;s probably very good for that science fiction role . 
And I was an artist . 
I could draw . I could paint . 
And because it &apos;s neither video games nor this saturation with computer @-@ generated movies , nor the whole visual language . In the media landscape , I had to give the images in my head . 
We all had to do that at the time . If we as children read a book , we took the author &apos;s description and projected it onto the screen . In our minds 
, my reaction was drawing and painting aliens . Aliens &apos; aliens , robots , spacecraft . And all of that . In math class , 
I was constantly caught by the teacher . Like me , hidden in the textbook , 
painting around , creativity had to sort of get out , 
and it was happening . Something interesting that happened to me was what fascinated me about Jacques Cousteaus &apos; shows . The idea of a world that we don &apos;t know about here on our planet . Even 
I would certainly never have an alien world with a spaceship . That seemed pretty unlikely to me . 
But here was a world that I could actually enter . Here on Earth , and it was just as fascinating and exotic as anything I thought I &apos;d ever imagined . When I read these books , 
so I decided when I was 15 , I was going to become a diver . 
The only problem with this was that I was in a small village in Canada , 1,000 miles from the next ocean . 
I left myself undiscouraged by this . 
I annoyed my father until he finally had a diving school in Buffalo , New York . Right on the other side of the border , where we lived . 
I made my diving certificate in a pool of YMCA in the middle of winter in Buffalo , New York . 
But the ocean got a real ocean , I got only two years later . When we moved to California , 
since then , in the 40 years that have passed , I &apos;ve been under 3,000 hours underwater . 500 hours of that in submersible boats . 
And I &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea itself is so rich in the flatter oceans , so fascinating in life . How do we really barely imagine it ? The imagination of 
nature knows . No limits . Unlike our own miserable human imagination , 
it doesn &apos;t . To this day , I find deep awe for what I have to do on my dives . 
And my love of the ocean continues to hold on with the same intensity as ever . 
And ever as I grew up as an adult , it was the filmmaking . 
That seemed the best way to make my inner urge to tell stories . With my need to create images , 
to unite . As a child , I drew comic books all the time . And 
so films were the way , pictures and stories were brought together . That fit together . 
Of course , the stories I chose were from the science fiction field : Terminator Aliens and Abyss . At 
Abyss , I could have my preference for the underwater world . And diving with filmmaking . 
So my two passions sort of intertwined . 
Something interesting happened . At Abyss , to solve a narrative problem in this movie . And that was , we had to create a kind of liquid water system . Let &apos;s grab computer @-@ generated animation . CG : 
What came out of this was the first computer @-@ generated soft surface figure ever to be seen in a movie . 
The film didn &apos;t bring any money . In fact , it just played its production costs . But I noticed something fascinating . The audience around the world was hypnotized . The magic that 
came out of it , according to Arthur Clarke &apos;s law , is , as you know , advanced technology and magic can no longer be distinguished from each other . So 
they saw something magical . 
And I found that incredibly exciting . 
And I thought , &quot; Wow , that absolutely must be involved in film art . &quot; 
So we went to Terminator 2 , my next movie , a lot further . 
Together with ILM , we created the guy there of liquid metal , which was a success . It was a success . How that effect would arrive . 
And it worked . Again , we had created something magical . And the effect in the audience was the same . But we did have a little bit more money with the film . 
Recorded by these two experiences , a whole new world had been achieved . A whole new world of creativity for filmmakers . 
So I started a company with my good friend Stan . Winston , who was the best make @-@ up and creature designer at that time . It was called Digital Domain . 
The basic idea of this company was to start the phase of analog processes with optical printers , etc . , and to start digital productions in a moment . 
And we did that , and we did it . For a while , we had a competitive advantage . 
But in the mid @-@ 1990s , we realized that we were in the Creature and Character Design , which we actually founded the company for . 
We were moving too slowly . I had written this piece of Avatar , which is the benchmark for visual effects and computer @-@ generated effects , pushing the bar to new heights . With realistic human expressive characters made using CG , And the main characters should be all CG . And the world should be CG . 
But the bar pretty much pushed back . And the people in my company told me that for the time being , we &apos;re not yet able to do that . 
So I shifted that , and I made this other movie about the big ship . 
This goes down to the studio , I have that as Romeo and Juliet sold it on a ship . It became a love movie of epic proportions , a passionate movie , secret 
. But did I actually want to be a real wreck ? Dive down the Titanic . So 
I made the film . 
That &apos;s the truth . The studio didn &apos;t know that . 
I convinced them , however , by saying , &quot; We dive to the wreck . &quot; We film the real wreck . 
We will do it in the opening sequence of the film . 
That &apos;s incredibly important . It &apos;s a good marketing tag . And 
I persuaded them to fund an expedition . 
Sounds crazy . But that &apos;s back to the fact that your imagination creates a reality . 
We actually created a reality six months later , where I got into a Russian dive boat , four kilometers below sea level , four kilometers below the North Atlantic . And I got the real Titanic through a bullet . This was 
not a movie . No HD . This was real . 
So this really bypassed me . 
And the preparations for this were enormous . We had to have cameras and headlights and everything . 
And I noticed how much these deep @-@ sea dive gears resembled a space mission . 
Well , they were also high @-@ tech and needed more . Planning : 
You go up into this capsule . Then you float into this dark , hostile environment where there &apos;s no hope of salvation . If you don &apos;t get it back yourself , 
and I thought , wow , that &apos;s the same as if I were in a science fiction movie . 
That &apos;s really cool . I 
was really obsessed . I was obsessed with exploring the deep sea , at least the part 
that has to do with curiosity and science . It was all . It was adventure . It was curiosity . It was imagination . 
And it was an experience that Hollywood didn &apos;t give me . 
Because , you know , I could imagine a being for which we would then create a visual effect . But I couldn &apos;t imagine what I could imagine outside the window , 
right ? Some of the expeditions that followed , I saw beings in thermal springs . And sometimes things I &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things like things that still nobody has ever seen before . And for those who science was at the time we saw them . Not a word 
at all . So that really turned me around . And I wanted more . 
And so I met a slightly unusual decision . 
After the success of Titanic , I said , &quot; Okay , I want to be my main profession as a filmmaker in Hollywood on ice , and I &apos;m going to be a full @-@ time researcher for a while . &quot; 
And then we started planning these expeditions . 
We went to Bismarck and we explored them with robotic vehicles . 
We went back to the wreck of the Titanic . 
We took small robots that we had built , which were carrying out a fiberglass cable . 
Our intention was to dive in and get to see the inside of the ship . What has never been done before . 
Nobody had ever had ever explored the inside of the wreck . You had no means of doing that . So we developed the technology we needed . 
NA : And I &apos;m sitting on the deck now . The Titanic . In a submersible boat , and I see planks that are quite similar to these boards here . And of those I know once the band was playing there . 
And I &apos;m flying through the band with a little robot vehicle . 
I &apos;m actually just operating it . But my consciousness is inside the vehicle . 
It felt like I was physically inside the ship wreck of the Titanic . 
That was the surreal form of a dÃ©jÃ  vu I &apos;ve ever experienced . Because before I was bogging around a corner , I always knew what was going to happen in the light cone of the vehicle . Because I walked over the movie set for months when we shot the film . 
Because the set was an exact copy of the ship &apos;s blueprints . 
So that was a very strange experience . 
She made me realize this telepresence experience that you use robotic avatars like this . And so your consciousness into the vehicle . In this other form of existence , 
it can be moved , it was really incredibly profound . 
And maybe a little bit of a view of what might be happening in a few decades . If you have cyborg bodies to explore something or other things to do . In all sorts of post @-@ human future scenarios that I can imagine as a science fiction fan . 
After these expeditions , we started what we saw down there . Really appreciate learning . For example , these deep sea equals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . These are , like , alien animals . But here on Earth . 
They live with chemosynthesis . 
They don &apos;t exist in sunlight . They exist in a system based on sunlight . As we do . 
And so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees Celsius . Hot water cloud live . And 
you can &apos;t imagine that they survive there . 
At the same time , I was also very interested in space science . This was again science fiction influence . From my childhood , 
and so I ended up with the people who were interested in space . And those with NASA have to do with NASA , and they sit on NASA &apos;s expert board and plan real space missions . They go to Russia , go through before the mission . The biomedical protocol , and all the drum and everything , flies . Then to the International Space Station , and they take our 3D camera systems . 
That was fascinating . 
But in the end , it was because I was a space scientist with us going into the deep sea . I took them 
and I gave them access to the world . Down there , astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme situations . I took them to the sources so they could look around , take samples and test instruments . And so on . 
We turned . We did documentary films . But actually science , more specifically space science , 
so the circle between my existence as a science fiction fan closed . Back then , when I was a kid and I was a reality . 
And as I went on this journey of discovery , I learned a lot . 
I learned a lot about science . But I also learned a lot about leadership . 
Now , you probably think a director must be able to lead . Being a guide , like a ship captain , or something like that . But 
I didn &apos;t understand much about leadership . Before I started these expeditions , 
because at a certain point , I had to tell myself , &quot; What am I doing ? &quot; Here 
. Why am I doing this ? What &apos;s coming out of this ? These 
stupid movies don &apos;t bring us money . We &apos;re just playing 
production costs . One of fame , no trace . 
Everybody thinks I &apos;m between Titanic and Avatar . I &apos;d run away and somewhere on a towel on the beach . 
I &apos;ve all made these movies , these documentary films , for a very small audience . 
No fame , no honor . No money . What are you doing ? 
You &apos;re doing it for the sake of the task , for the sake of the challenge . And the ocean is the most challenging environment that exists . You &apos;re doing it for the discovery . And because of the strange connection that emerges when a small group of people form a team . 
Because we have all of this at just 10 to 12 people who have been working together for years and years . Sometimes we were two to three months in a row at sea . 
And in this community , you can see that the most important thing is respect that you have in front of each other because you &apos;ve done a job that you can &apos;t explain to anyone else . 
If you return to land and say , &quot; We had to do it . &quot; The fiberglass , the sound attenuation . And all around . The whole technique . And the difficulties , the human performance . If you work at sea , you can just not explain that to others . This is like policemen or soldiers who do something in common , and they do . And they know they never can explain it to anyone . 
And there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect . 
So when I came back to my next movie , Avatar , I tried to apply the same leadership style , which is that you respect your team and in return deserve respect . 
And that really changed the dynamics . 
So I stood there again with a small team on unknown terrain . We turned Avatar with a new technology that it had not existed before . 
It was incredibly exciting . 
It was a tremendous challenge . 
And we got to work for a period of four and a half years to become a real family . 
And that changed my way of making films . 
It changed completely . There were people who thought we had these ocean properties . Yes . Really . Good . Tone . And on the planet . Pandora transported . For 
me , it was more of a principled way of doing my job . The actual process that changed as a result . 
So what can we conclude from all of this ? 
What lessons have we learned ? 
I think the first thing is curiosity . 
It &apos;s the most powerful human property . Our 
imagination is a force that even creates a reality . 
And respect for your team is more important than all laurels . This world comes 
to me : Young filmmakers . They say , &quot; Give me a advice . &quot; How do I do this ? And 
I say , &quot; Don &apos;t limit you . &quot; Even 
one that already gets others for you . Don &apos;t do it . Bet yourself , don &apos;t bet against yourself , but take risks for you . 
NASA has such a favorite sentence . Failure is not an alternative . But 
in art and in exploration , failure has to be an alternative . Because there it guarantees a positive outcome of trust . 
No important undertaking . Innovation has ever been approached without risk . 
You have to be ready . Such risks have 
to be taken . That &apos;s the idea I &apos;d like to share with you . Failure is an alternative . Fear . But is not one . Thank you . 
If I can bring you one thing closer today , it &apos;s that the whole data we consume is larger than the data we consume , the sum of their parts . And instead of thinking about overloading information , I want you to think about how we are information . So that we can use patterns to emerge . And we see trends that otherwise are not visible . 
So what we see here is a typical death chart , arranged by age . 
The program I &apos;m using here is a little experiment . 
It &apos;s called Pivot . And what I can do with Pivot is that I &apos;m going to filter for a certain cause of death . Let &apos;s say accidents . 
And immediately I see another pattern that emerges , 
and that &apos;s because in the middle area here , people are the most active . And you &apos;re the most frail over here . 
We can go one step further and sort out the data . Then , new and see that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects . But not for everybody . Now , 
if we go further and sort by age , we say 40 years or younger . Let &apos;s see that accidents are even the main cause . The people worry about should be , and who 
&apos;s researching , see that this is particularly true for men . 
So you realize that the reputation of information and data in this way is very much swimming . In a vivid information graph , it &apos;s reminiscent . 
And if we do this for raw data , why not for content itself ? 
So what we have here are the cover images of each and every sport Illustrated that have ever been printed . 
It &apos;s all here . It &apos;s all online . 
You can like it after I gave my talk in your rooms . 
With Pivot , you can dive into a decade . 
You can dive into a given year . 
You can dive directly to a particular issue . 
Now , if I look here , I see the athletes who are out in this issue and the sports . 
I &apos;m a Lance Armstrong fan . So I click here , which makes all the issues that Lance Armstrong mentions to me . 
Now , if I get just a bigger overview , I could . I think , OK , what ? If I look at cycling , what about cycling , 
so I take a step back and expand the perspective . 
Now I see Greg Lemon . 
And so you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , more targeted , wider , more pure , zooming out . Then you don &apos;t look or surf . Not just . 
You do something that &apos;s actually a little different . 
It &apos;s something in between . And we think it changes the way that information is used , and we think it changes the way that information can be used . 
I want to take this idea a little bit further . So , with about what &apos;s a little crazy , 
what we &apos;ve done here is : We have taken every single wikipedia page and put it down to a little summary . 
The summary contains a short overview and a symbol for the range from which it comes . 
I &apos;ll just show you one . The top 500 of the most popular wikipedia pages . 
But even in this narrow view , we can do a lot of things . 
We get an instant impression of the issues that are most popular on Wikipedia . 
I &apos;m going to vote on the government issue . 
Now , after I &apos;ve elected government , I realize that the categories of wikipedia that are most covered by it -- Time Magazines -- are people of the year . 
This is really important . Because this is a realization that is not in a single wikipedia page . 
This is only to be seen . If you go back a step and look at the whole thing , 
looking at one of these summaries , can I then go into the theme of Time Magazines , People of the Year , and see everybody together ? Now 
, if I look at all these people , I realize that the majority of them are government officials . Some come from science . Some come from economics , some come from economics . Here &apos;s my boss . And one comes from music . 
And interestingly , Bono is also a TED Prize winner . 
So we can jump and take a look at all the TED Prize winners . 
You see , we &apos;re surfing the web . The first time it &apos;s really like it &apos;s a web . Not only from side to side , but much more abstract . 
And so I want to show you what else is , which might be a little surprise . 
I &apos;m just going to show you the New York Times website . 
Pivot . This application . I don &apos;t want a browser . It &apos;s really not a browser . But you can look at websites with it . And we bring this zoom technology to every single website like this . 
So I can take a step back and go directly to a specific section . 
So that &apos;s important because you can only look at websites in this way and look at them all the way the Internet progresses in the same way , in the same way . 
So I can zoom in into my course , in a certain time frame . So 
here &apos;s the state of the whole demonstration that I &apos;ve kept going up to now . 
And I can sort of pull everything I &apos;ve seen so far . I can get back again . 
And if I go out a step and look at everything , I can refresh my course , maybe after my search past . Here I &apos;ve been looking for nepotistic . Here &apos;s Bing , or Here &apos;s live Labs Pivot . 
And from here , I can go into the page . And call it again . 
It &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again . And every time it makes the overall picture bigger than the sum of the data pieces . 
Right now , in this world , we think data is a curse . 
We talk about the curse of the abundance of information . 
We talk about drowning in information . 
What if we could turn this situation around ? And the Internet upside down so that we , instead of always being from one to the other , start . From many things to many things to many things . And by doing that , we can see patterns that would otherwise have been hidden . 
If we can do this , then this hitherto data trap may be a new source of meaningful information . 
And instead of just getting in information , we can know from it . 
And if we know , then maybe we can even know wisdom . So I stop 
learning from it . Thank you very much . 
Everybody talks today about happiness . 
I have some people , the number of books that count with happiness in the title in the last five years , published . And they gave up after about 40 . And there were many more . 
There &apos;s a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers . 
There &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching . 
Everybody would like to make people happier . 
But despite all this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps that , in a way , make it almost impossible . Sure . Thinking about happiness 
and my talk . Today , it &apos;s mostly these cognitive traps that will act . 
That &apos;s true for laymen who are thinking about their own happiness . And it &apos;s true for scientists who are thinking about happiness because it turns out we &apos;re just as confused as anyone else . 
The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity . 
It turns out the word happiness is simply not a useful word anymore . Because we put it on too many different things . 
I think there &apos;s a certain meaning on which we could limit it . But by and large , this is something we &apos;re going to have to give up . And we &apos;re going to have to take the complicated view . What well @-@ being is . 
The second case is a confusion of experience and memory . Basically , it &apos;s between happiness . In his life and being happy about his life or happy with his life . 
And these are two very different concepts . And they &apos;re both thrown together . In the notion of happiness , 
and the third is the concentration illusion . And that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we don &apos;t think about a fact . Well @-@ being affects without distorting its meaning . 
I mean , this is a real cognitive trap . 
There &apos;s just no way . It &apos;s getting right . 
Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example from someone who had a question and answer session . After one of my lectures , which reported a story , it was unclear . He said he &apos;d heard a symphony . And it was absolutely wonderful music . And at the very end of the recording , there was a terrible , creeping sound . 
And then he added , &quot; Really , quite emotionally . That &apos;s ruined the whole experience . 
But it didn &apos;t have 
what it had ruined . &quot; Were the memories of the experience ? 
He had had the experience . 
He had 20 minutes of wonderful music . 
They didn &apos;t count because he stayed with a memory . The memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he kept getting . 
What that really tells us is that we &apos;re talking about ourselves and about other people . In the sense of two kinds of self . 
There &apos;s a self that is alive in the present . And the present knows is capable of rebuilding the past . But basically , only the present has 
it . It &apos;s the living self that the doctor instigates . You know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Is it hurting now ? &quot; If I touch you here , 
and then there &apos;s a remembering self . And the remembering self is that &apos;s what &apos;s mitzÃ¤hlt . And the story of our lives keeps up . And it &apos;s the one that the doctor addresses by asking the question . How did you feel recently ? Or 
how was your journey to Albania ? Or something like that ? 
These are two very different units . The living self . And the remembering self . And confusing the two is part of the coexistence of the term happiness . 
Now , the remembering self is a storyteller . 
And that really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memories . It starts immediately . 
We &apos;re not just telling stories . If we make ourselves tell stories , 
our memory tells us stories . That means what we keep from our experiences is a story . 
And let &apos;s just start with an example . 
There &apos;s an old study . 
These are real patients who are going to undergo a painful procedure . 
I &apos;m not going to go into detail . It &apos;s no longer painful today . But it was painful when this study was done in the 1990s . 
They were asked to do their pain every 60 seconds . And 
here are two patients . These are their records . 
And they &apos;re asked , who of both suffered more ? And 
this is a very simple question . 
Patient B has suffered more clearly . His intestinal reflection was longer . And every minute of pain , the patient had A , patient B and more . 
But now there &apos;s another question : How much did these patients think they suffered ? And 
here &apos;s a surprise . And 
the surprise is that patient A has a much worse memory of intestinal reflection than patient B. Patient B. has had 
the stories of intestinal reflections differently . And because a very critical part of the story is how it ends . 
And none of these stories is very edible or great . But one of them is clear . But one of them is significantly worse than the other . 
And the one that is worse was where the pain was at the very end of its peak . It &apos;s a bad story . 
How do we know that ? 
Because we &apos;re going to ask these people about their gut reflection , and much later on , how bad was it . The whole thing . And 
it was much worse for A than for B in memory . 
Well , this is a direct conflict between the living self and the remembering . Even 
from the perspective of the living self , B clearly had a worse time . 
Now , what you could do with patient A . And we actually did clinical experiments . And it was done . And it works . You could actually use patient A to prolong the intestinal reflection by just putting the tube in . Without too much shake on it . 
That will make the patient suffer , but only a little bit and much less than before . 
And if you do that for a few minutes , you &apos;ve made the living self of the patient A worse off than that . And you &apos;ve made the memory self of patient A much better off than that . Because now you have patient A better story about your experience . 
What does a story look like ? 
And that &apos;s true of the stories that memory gives us . And it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent , which 
makes a story unique . Breaks , significant moments and ends 
are very , very important . And in this case , the end dominated . 
Now , the living self is constantly living its life . 
It has moments of experience one after the other . 
And you ask , what happens to these moments ? 
And the answer is really simple . They &apos;re lost forever . 
I mean , most moments of our lives . And I &apos;ve calculated this . You know , the psychological presence is considered to be for about three seconds . What does it mean ? Do you know that in a life there are about 600 million of them ? In a month , there are about 600,000 . Most of them leave no trace . 
Most of them are completely ignored by the memory self . 
And yet , somehow they get the impression that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience . Our life is , 
it &apos;s the limited resource we consume . While we are in this world 
and how we consume it , it would seem important . But that &apos;s not the story that the memory self keeps for us . 
So we have the memory self . And the living self . And they &apos;re really quite different . 
The biggest difference between them is how to deal with time 
from the perspective of the living . Even if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first . Then the two @-@ week holiday is twice as good as the one @-@ week holiday . 
That &apos;s not how it works at all . For the memorative self , 
for the memorative self , a two @-@ week holiday is . Hardly better than the one @-@ week holiday . Because there are no new memories added . 
You don &apos;t change the story . 
And that &apos;s how time is actually the critical variable that a memorative self distinguishes from a living self , which has time . Very little influence on that story . 
Now , the remembering self makes more than remembering and telling stories . 
It &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions . Because if you have a patient who , let &apos;s say , has two intestinal reflections at two different . Surgeons had , and decides , which one to choose . Then the one who chooses is the one who has the memory that &apos;s less bad . And that &apos;s the surgeon who will be selected . 
The living self has no voice . In this election , actually , 
we don &apos;t choose between experiences . We choose between memories of experiences 
and even experiences . If we think about the future , we think about our future . Normally not as experiences . 
We think about our future as anticipated memories . 
And basically , you can look at that . You know , as a tyranny of the memory self . And you can look at the memory self . As one , the living self , so to speak , tugs through experiences that the living self doesn &apos;t need . 
I have the impression that if we go on vacation , that &apos;s very often the case , that &apos;s to say . We go on vacation as far as possible in the service of the memory self . 
And that &apos;s a little hard to justify , I think . 
I mean , how much do we feed from our memories ? 
That &apos;s one of the explanations that is for the dominance of the memory self . 
And when I think about that , I think about a vacation that we spent a few years ago in Antarctica , which is clearly the best vacation we &apos;ve ever had in Antarctica that I &apos;ve ever had . And I think about it relatively often relative to how often I think about other vacations . 
And I probably have from my memories of this three @-@ week journey . I would say for about 25 minutes in the last four years . 
Now , if I &apos;d ever opened the folder with the 600 images in it , I would have spent another hour . 
Now , that &apos;s three weeks . And that &apos;s at most one and a half hours . 
It seems to be a disagreement . 
Now , I like to be a little extreme . You know , in it , how little appetite I have for feeding memories ? But even if you do more of it , there &apos;s a real question . Why do we give so much weight to memories ? In the scourge to the weight that we give experiences . 
So I want you to think about a thought experiment . 
Imagine your next vacation . You know that at the end of your vacation , all your pictures are destroyed . And you get an amnesty drug so you get nothing to remember , you don &apos;t remember . 
Now , would you choose the same vacation ? And if you choose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species of vacation : Self . And you have to think about how you decide this conflict . And that &apos;s really not obvious at all . Because if you want to think about time , you get an answer . And if you want to think about memories , you could get a different answer . 
Why choose the vacations that we choose is ? A problem that confronts us with a choice between the two types of self . 
Now , the two kinds of self throw two terms of happiness . 
There are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply . One per self . 
So you can ask , how happy is the living self ? 
And then you would ask , how happy are the moments in the life of the living being ? Even , 
and you &apos;re all lucky for moments . Is a fairly complicated process ? 
What are the emotions ? Which can be measured ? 
And by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea . Of the happiness of the living self over time , 
when you &apos;re looking for the happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a very different thing . 
This is not about how happy . A person lives . 
It &apos;s about how satisfied or happy . The person is when this person is thinking about his life , 
very different terms . 
Anyone who doesn &apos;t differentiate these terms will study happiness . And I &apos;m a lot of researchers about well @-@ being , who are long masking the exploration of happiness . Right ? That &apos;s the way that 
the distinction between happiness of the living self and happiness of the remembering self is . In recent years , it &apos;s been recognized , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separately . 
The Gallup Organization has a global survey , where more than half a million people have asked questions about this . What they know about their lives and their experiences ? And there have been other efforts in this direction . 
In recent years , we &apos;ve started to think about the happiness of the two kinds of self . 
And the main lesson we &apos;ve learned , I think , is that they &apos;re really different . 
You can know how satisfied someone with their lives is . And that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happy he lives his life . And vice versa . 
Just to give you an idea of correlation that correlation is , you know ? About five percent of 
what that means is that if you hit somebody , and you would tell them , &quot; Oh , his father is a two @-@ meter man , how much ? &quot; Would you know about his size ? 
Well , you would know something about his size . But there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty . 
You have so much uncertainty . 
If I tell you that someone has his life as eight on a scale of 10 , you know . Do you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy ? He &apos;s with his survivor . 
Even the correlation is small . 
We know something about what happiness self happiness determines . 
We know money is very important . Targets are very important . 
We know happiness means happiness is primarily about being satisfied with people we like , spending time . With people we like , 
there &apos;s other pleasure . But that &apos;s dominant . 
So if you &apos;re lucky about the two kinds of self , you want to maximize it . You &apos;re going to end up doing very different things . So 
the conclusion from what I &apos;ve said here is that we &apos;re really not imagining happiness really when we &apos;re replacing happiness with well @-@ being . 
It &apos;s a completely different term . 
Now , very briefly . Another reason we don &apos;t know clearly about happiness is because of the fact that we don &apos;t think about the same things . When we think about life , and when we actually live 
, when they &apos;re the simple question of how happy the people in California are , will they not be the correct answer ? 
If they ask that question , do they think that the people in California need to be happier ? If they say , &quot; We live in Ohio , &quot; 
and what happens is that if they talk about life in California , they think about the difference between California and other places . And that difference is , say , climate . 
Well , it turns out climate isn &apos;t very important to the living self . And it &apos;s not even very important for the thoughtful . Even that decides how happy people are . 
Well . But because the thoughtful self is responsible , you can end up with some people . At the end , they can move to California , 
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track . What happens to people who move to California ? In the hope of becoming happier , 
now their living self becomes . Not happier , 
we know . 
But one thing will happen . You &apos;ll think you &apos;re happier . Because if you think about it , you &apos;ll be reminded of how terrible the weather in Ohio was . And you &apos;ll feel you &apos;re making the right decision . 
It &apos;s very difficult to think clearly about well @-@ being . And I hope I have an impression of how difficult it is to think about it . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question for you . 
Thank you very much . 
Well , when we telephoned a couple of weeks ago , you told me that it was a pretty interesting result that came out of this Gallup survey , and 
is that something that you &apos;re going to be able to share with us ? Because you &apos;re now left a few minutes . 
Daniel Kahneman : Sure . 
I think the most interesting result we have in the Gallup survey is a number that we have absolutely no idea what to find . 
We found that in terms of happiness for the survivor himself . 
If we looked at how feelings with income vary , 
and it turns out that among the results of an income of 60,000 dollars in a year , for Americans . And that &apos;s a very big sample of Americans . About 600,000 . But it &apos;s a big representative sample of income under 600,000 . About 
60,000 . 
DK : 60,000 , 
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy . And they &apos;re getting increasingly unhappy . The poorer they get 
, we get an absolutely flat line about it . 
I mean , I rarely saw such flat lines . 
What happens is , obviously , money doesn &apos;t get you experience happiness . But that lack of money certainly gives you misery , and we can get this misery very , very clearly . 
In the sense of the other , even the remembering self , you get a different story . 
The more money you make , the more satisfied you are . 
That &apos;s not true of emotions . 
CA : But Danny , throughout America , this is about life . Freedom , the quest for happiness . 
When people take this finding seriously , I think it all seems to be upside down . Everything we believe , for example , in tax policy . And so on , 
there &apos;s a chance that politicians , that the country in general , has a finding like that , would take seriously . And based on that , politics would do 
DK , you know ? I think there &apos;s recognition . There &apos;s recognition for the role of gambling research in politics , 
recognition will be slow . In the United States , no question . But in the United Kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now . And in other countries , it &apos;s happening right now . 
People are acknowledging that they &apos;re lucky thinking about happiness . If you think about politics , 
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will discuss whether you want to explore experience happiness , or whether you want to explore life assessment . So we need to have this discussion pretty soon , 
how to increase happiness , very different things happen . Depending on how you think , and whether you think about the memory self , or whether you think about the living self . 
That will affect politics . I think in the years ahead , 
in the United States , you &apos;re tightening on the experience happiness of the population . 
That , I think , will be in the next decade or two part of national statistics . 
CA : Well , it seems to me that this topic is , or should at least be , the most interesting political debate to follow over the next few years . 
Thank you very much . For the invention of behavioral economics . 
Thank you . Danny Kahneman : Today 
I &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate . 
And that might surprise you a little . Because my full @-@ time work at the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds , about the things we invent and deliver to make the poorest two billion . Better life possible . 
But energy and climate are extremely important . For these people , in fact , even more important than for any other on the planet . 
Climate degradation means that their seeds will not grow for many years , we will be too much rain or too little rain . Things will change as it changes their fragile environment , which will not be sustainable . 
This leads to starvation . It leads to insecurity . It leads to unrest . 
So climate change is going to be terrible for you . And 
also , the energy price is very important for you . 
The fact is , if you &apos;re talking about just one thing , you could reduce the price , to reduce poverty , energy would be by far the most effective . 
Now , the energy price has fallen over time . 
In fact , the progress society is based on energy advances that drove 
coal evolution . The industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid fall in the electricity price . And so we have refrigerators . Air conditioning : We can make modern materials . And so many things do . 
So we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world . 
But if we reduce the price , we let the price halve , we hit a new barrier . And this barrier is related to CO2 , 
CO2 warms the planet and the equation for CO2 is . Actually , pretty clear . 
They sum up . The one that &apos;s emitted . CO2 . Which leads to temperature increase . And this temperature increase has some very negative effects on the weather . And maybe worse , the indirect effect is that natural ecosystems are undergoing such rapid change that they cannot adapt . And so whole systems collapse . 
Now , the exact link between a CO2 increase and the resulting temperature change , and where its further consequences lie . There are some ambiguities . But not very many . 
And there &apos;s certainly uncertainty about how bad these consequences will be . But they will be extremely bad . 
I &apos;ve asked the top scientists several times , &quot; Do we really have to get down to near zero ? 
&quot; &quot; Is not half or a quarter enough ? 
&quot; The answer is , until we get near zero . Will the temperature continue to rise ? 
So it &apos;s a big challenge . 
It &apos;s quite different from saying . We have a three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ foot truck that &apos;s under a three @-@ meter bridge . It &apos;s got to come here , and you can sort of squeeze it down below 
. This has to be down to zero . 
Well , we run a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons . 
Every American , about 20 tons of people from poor countries , less than one on average , 
it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet . 
And somehow we have to create changes that reduce that to zero . 
It &apos;s been constantly increasing . 
Just different economic ones . Changes have actually affected it . And we have to move from rapid growth to reduction and a reduction , to zero . 
This equation has four factors : A bit of multiplication . You have this thing on the left , CO2 , that you want to get to zero . And that &apos;s determined by the number of people , by the services that every human being uses on average , by the average energy for every service and by the CO2 per unit of energy . 
So let &apos;s take a look at each factor individually . And let &apos;s think about how we get that to zero . 
One of these numbers probably has to get very close to zero . 
Now , this is basic algebra . But let &apos;s go through it . 
First of all , we have the population living 
today . 6.8 billion people . 
And it goes to 9 billion , 
which goes to 9 billion , to 9 billion . If we succeed very successfully with new vaccines , healthcare and reproductive medicine . Could we possibly do that by 10 to 15 percent ? But right now we &apos;re seeing a 1.3 percent rise . 
The second factor is the services we use . 
That includes all the food we eat : Clothing , television , heating . 
These are very good things . And poverty reduction means these services to almost everyone on the planet . 
It &apos;s great that this number is rising 
in the rich world , in the top billion , we might be able to make cuts and use less . But on average , this number is going to rise every year , and so it &apos;s more than doubling overall . The number of services per person that are provided . 
Here &apos;s a very basic service . Is there light at home to do the homework ? 
And these students don &apos;t have it . So they go out and read . Their school tasks under the street light . 
Now , effectiveness , the E , the energy per service , is finally good news . 
We have something that doesn &apos;t go up . 
Because of various successes in the lighting sector , other types of cars , new building methods . There are many services whose energy consumption can drastically reduce them , and they can be drastically reduced . 103.00 , 05.50,000 GT , 00.05.53.53 , 000.000 Some services can be reduced by 90 % . 
Some individual services can be reduced by 90 % . 
Other services , such as fertilisers production ( 105.00 , 05.56.000 ) , GT 00 , 05.58.58 000 or the aviation sector or air transport , are subject to 
room for improvement , much smaller . Overall , if we are optimistic , we may get a reduction of a factor 3 or perhaps even a factor 6 . 
But in the first three factors , we &apos;re now from 26 billion to maybe the very best . 13 billion tons went . And that &apos;s just not enough . 
So let &apos;s look at the fourth factor . And this will be a key factor . That &apos;s the amount of CO2 per unit of energy emitted . 
It &apos;s the question of whether you can get that to zero . 
If you burn coal , no , 
if you burn natural gas , no , 
almost every method of producing electricity emits . Today , CO2 , except renewable energy and nuclear energy . 
So what we do on a global scale is a new system to 
create . We need energy under . 
Now , if I use the term &quot; miracle , &quot; I don &apos;t mean the impossible , 
the microprocessor is . A miracle , the PC is a miracle . 
The Internet and its services are a miracle . 
The people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles . 
Normally , there &apos;s no deadline for you to do a miracle by a certain date . 
Normally , you &apos;re just standing next to it . And some don &apos;t come to others . In 
this case , we have to give full gas , and a miracle in a very short time . 
Well , I wondered , how can I really get this over ? 
Is there a natural illustration , a demonstration , that shows the idea of the people here ? 
I remembered last year . When I brought mosquitos , and somehow people liked that . 
The idea really became tangible to them . You know , there are people who live with mosquitos 
, for energy , I noticed this . 
I decided that releasing fireflies was my contribution this year to the environment here . 
So here are some natural fireflies . 
I &apos;ve been assured they &apos;re not biting . In fact , they &apos;re not even going to leave the glass . 
Well , there are all kinds of game solutions like this . But they &apos;re not all doing much . 
We need solutions . Either one or more that can scale unimaginable and unimaginable reliability . And though there are many directions where people are looking for it , I really see only five of them who are able to meet these big demands . 
I have tides , geothermal fusion and biofuels . 
They may make a moderate contribution . And if they do better than I expect , that would be great . But my key message here is that we are working on all of those five . And we can &apos;t give up on them because they intimidate us . Because everybody has significant problems . 
Let &apos;s first look at burning . Fossil fuels : Burning either coal or natural gas . 
What you have to do there may seem simple . But that &apos;s not it . You have to take all the CO2 that comes out of the chimney after burning . Capture under pressure , liquefy . And then store somewhere and hope that it stays there . 
There are some pilot projects that do this at a 60 / 80 level . But it &apos;s getting to 100 , it &apos;s going to be very difficult , and an agreement on the storage of CO2 is a big challenge . But the biggest problem . Here &apos;s the question of storage time . 
Who will make sure ? 
Who can guarantee something ? What literally is many billion times bigger than any kind of waste you get from nuclear and other things you 
can imagine . That &apos;s a lot of volume . 
So this is a hard nut . 
Next , nuclear energy 
, which also has three major problems . The cost , especially in highly regulated countries , is high . The question of security , that you really feel that nothing can go wrong . Despite human collaboration , that the fuel is not used for weapons . 
And then what do you do ? With the waste . 
Because although it &apos;s not very big , there are a lot of concerns . 
People have to feel good about it . 
184,00 , 10 , 20,000 GT , 00 , 10 , 25,000 . So three very difficult problems that may be solvable . So three very difficult problems that may be solvable . And so you should work on those , 
the last three of the five have . So I &apos;ll summarize . 
These are renewable energy . As you &apos;re often called , 
and they also have , although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel . They have some disadvantages . 
One is . The energy density that these technologies generate is dramatically lower than that of power plants . 
These are low @-@ energy energy . You talk about many square kilometers , thousands of times more space than a normal power plant . And 
also , these sources are subject to interruptions . 
The sun doesn &apos;t shine all day long . Nor does it shine every day . And the wind doesn &apos;t blow all the time . 
So if you &apos;re from these sources , you have to have a way to use energy even in times . If it &apos;s not available to 
get it . So there are big price challenges here . There are challenges in transmission . For example , if we say that the energy source is outside the country , you don &apos;t just need technology . You also need to deal with the risk that the energy is coming from where it comes from . 
And there &apos;s the storage problem . 
And to show the dimension , I &apos;ve looked at all kinds of batteries that are made , which are used for cars , computers , cell phones , flashlights for everything . And I &apos;ve got that with the amount of electronic energy that the world uses . I found that all the batteries that we &apos;re now producing are less than 10 minutes of total energy storage . 
Could we need a big breakthrough here ? Something that &apos;s better by a factor of 100 than the approaches . Right now , 
that &apos;s not impossible . But it &apos;s not that easy . 
That &apos;s what happens when you try to get these interrupted sources to , say , 20 @-@ 30 percent of consumption . 
If you &apos;re 100 percent to rely on that , you need an incredible wonder battery . 
Now , where are we going to go ? What &apos;s the right approach ? 
A Manhattan project . How do we get to the finish ? 
What we need is a lot of companies working on it . Hundreds 
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people . 
For many , you &apos;ll say , they &apos;re crazy . That &apos;s good . 
I think here in the TED group , there are many who are already engaged . 
Bill Gross has several companies , including one called Esolar . The great . Solar thermal technologies have 
Vinod . Khosla is investing in dozens of companies . The great things are doing and have interesting opportunities . And I &apos;m trying to support that . 
Nathan Myhrvold : And I fund a company that , surprisingly , perhaps has a nuclear approach . 
There are some innovations in the nuclear sector : Modular , liquid , 
that &apos;s developing . In this industry some time ago , it stopped , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts lie around , and 
the Terrapower concept means that instead of a part of the uranium , one percent , you have the U235 . We decided to burn the 99 . The U238 . This 
is a pretty crazy idea . But 
in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time . But you could never simulate it sensibly . Whether it would work , but since there are modern supercomputers . Can you simulate it ? And you can see that , yes , with the right approach to matter , it looks like it works , 
and because you burn these 99 , it &apos;s like this . The cost profile is much better . In fact , 
you burn the garbage , and you can even burn the garbage from today &apos;s reactors as 
a drive . Instead of turning your head apart , they just burn it . A great thing . 
Uranium is being used gradually . A little bit like a candle . 
You can see that it &apos;s a kind of column . It &apos;s often called a wandering wave reactor 
, which really solves the fuel problem . 
Here &apos;s a picture of a place in Kentucky . 
This is the waste . The 99 . You have the part that &apos;s burned today . You have taken it out . So it &apos;s called depleted uranium . 
That drives U.S. for hundreds of years to come . 
And if you buy ocean water cheaply and simply filtered , you get enough fuel . For the rest of the planet &apos;s 
life . You know , there are many challenges there . But it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward to get ahead . 
Let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success 
. How should our testimony look ? 
Well , we go to the goal that we need to achieve . And then we talk about the intermediate step . 
Many talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 . 
It &apos;s really , really important that we get there , 
the remaining 20 percent is produced in poor countries , and still some agriculture . Hopefully , forest threats and cement will be clean by then . 
So to get to that 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like China , needs to completely transform their generation of electricity . 
The other note says , is we using zero emissions technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries ? And we &apos;re on the way to getting them to the 
rest . That &apos;s super important . 
That &apos;s going to be a key element . This certificate , if we 
go back from there . How should that look like 2020 ? 
It should be back in the two elements . 
We should use the effectiveness measures to get reduction on the way . The less we emit , the lower the amount of CO2 will be . And so will the temperature . 
But actually , this note is for the things we do , those that are not completely related to the big reductions . Just the same or even a little less . Important , like the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs . 
We need to track these breakthroughs with full @-@ gas . And we can measure that . In company numbers , in pilot projects and regulatory changes . 
There are many great books on this subject , 
the Al Gore book . We have the choice , and David McKay &apos;s Sustainable Energy . Without the Hot Air , you 
really go through it and create a framework in which this is widely discussed . Because we need support from all sides for this . 
There are some things that need to come together . 
This is a wish . 
A very concrete wish that we invent this technology . 
If you just want me a wish for the next 50 years . I could choose the president , a vaccine . And I love that . Or I could choose that wish . This is half @-@ energy price . Without CO2 , it &apos;s invented . I would take that 
wish . This one has the greatest impact . 
If we don &apos;t get that wish , the gap between the long @-@ term and the short @-@ term thinking people will become terrible . Between the United States and China , between poor and rich countries , and almost all lives . This two billion is going to be much worse . 
So what do we have to do ? 
What action do I appeal for ? 
We have to work for more research funding . 
If countries are in places like Koppenhagen , they should not only be talking about CO2 . 
They should be discussing this innovation strategy . And they would be shocked by the ridiculous . Low money for these innovative approaches is spent . 
We need market incentives . We need carbon taxes . CAP . Amp ; Trade . Something that sends a price signal . 
We need to spread the news . 
We need dialogue , rationality and completeness , and also the things that the government is doing . 
It &apos;s an important wish . But I think we can fulfill it . 
Thank you very much . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . Thank you . 
Thank you . Thank you very much . Just to get a little better at understanding Terrapower . First of all , you can give us an idea of the magnitude of this investment . 
Bill Gates : To simulate on a supercomputer . To get all the big scientists what we &apos;ve done , we just need a few 10 million . And even if we put our materials in a Russian reactor to make sure it &apos;s reasonable to work . Is it only in the 100 million that you 
&apos;re tough ? Step is building the first reactor , another billion to find . The regulations and the place where they actually build the first one . 
Once the first one is finished , when it &apos;s running as promised , then it &apos;s all very clear . Because the economic viability , the energy density , is as different as nuclear energy as we are . 
You know . CA : To understand that correctly . That means deep into the ground . Almost like a vertical pillar of nuclear fuel . This used uranium , and then the process starts up and continues . Down . 
BG : Exactly . Today you always have to refill the reactor . So there are lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong . This thing where you open it and things in or out . That &apos;s not good . 
But if you have very cheap fuel , you can refill it for 60 years . Think of a column that you bury without the whole complexities . 
And it sits there and burns . For 60 years . And then it &apos;s done . 
CA : A nuclear reactor that itself is a solution to the garbage . 
BG : Yeah . Now , what happens to the garbage ? You can let it sit . There &apos;s much less garbage . So with this method , you take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it further . 
And we start by taking the garbage that already exists , which is in these refrigerators or dry containers at the reactors . That &apos;s our starting fuel . So what is 
that for these reactors was a problem ? What we do in our fill , and that &apos;s dramatically reducing the garbage volume . During that process . 
CA : But as you go with different people in the world and talk about these possibilities , Where 
is the greatest interest ? So , to actually implement this . 
BG : Well , we haven &apos;t yet set ourselves in a place . And there &apos;s a lot of interesting disclosure rules for everything . The nuclear in the name is there . There &apos;s a lot of interest . And the people of the company were in Russia , India , China . I was here and I met the energy minister and talked about how this fits into the energy agenda . 
I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the French and Japanese have something in the direction . 
This is a variant of one thing . It was done . 
This is an important step forward . But it &apos;s like a fast reactor . And some countries have built this . So anyone who &apos;s implemented a fast reactor is . A candidature for our first one . 
CA : In your imagination , timeframe and probability . So , to really create this . 
BG : Well , we need one of these scalable , power generating things that is very cheap . We &apos;ve got 20 years to invent . And then 20 years to deploy . 
This is kind of the deadline that environmental models have shown us that we have to meet . 
And you know , Terrapower , if everything goes well . And this is a big wish . Could that keep 
it easy ? And fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds that , if their approaches work , work the same way . Promoting their pilots works for that . Can compete , 
and it would be best . If several do , because then you could use a mix . In any case , 
we need a solution . 
CA : Concerning the big possible breakthroughs , this is the biggest thing you know . 
BG : An energy break is the most important thing . 
That would be without the environmental challenge . But it &apos;s still so much more important to do it 
in the nuclear sector . Are there other innovative things 
? Companies ? You know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as they do . But there &apos;s the modular method . That &apos;s a different approach . 
There &apos;s a liquid reactor type that seems a little difficult . But maybe they say that about us . 
And so there are different ones . But the nice thing about this is that a uranium molecule is a million times as much energy as a coal molecule , let &apos;s say . And so if you deal with the problems and they &apos;re mostly the radiation of the footprint . And the cost plays the potential . So the impact on the land and other things , almost in a league of its own . 
CA : If that doesn &apos;t work , what 
do we have to do is take emergency measures to try and keep the Earth temperature stable ? 
BG : If you get into this situation , it &apos;s as if you ate too much . And just before a heart attack , you &apos;re about to say , &quot; What do you do ? &quot; Then ... You might need a heart surgery or something like that . 
There &apos;s a research that &apos;s called geoengineering , which is based on different techniques to deal with the delay in warming , so that we can take 20 or 30 years longer to get together . 
This is just an insurance method . 
You hope we don &apos;t need that . 
Some people say you shouldn &apos;t be at insurance first because you have to maybe be lazy because you &apos;re going to eat , because you know you &apos;re going to have heart surgery rescuing you . 
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart if you think about the importance of this problem . But there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you can have that at your disposal . If things get faster or this innovation takes longer than we expect . 
CA : Climate skeptics , do you have one or two sentences ? For those around you , maybe to convince you . 
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps . 
Those who make scientific arguments are very little . 
Tell them that there are negative effects that are associated with clouds . Things shift . 
There are very , very few things that you can even say about , which give it a chance in a million . 
The main problem here is similar to AIDS . 
You make the mistake . Now , and you pay for it much later . 
And so the idea is now . If you can have all kinds of urgent problems investing in something you &apos;re only going to have later on , and then , the investment is not so clear . In fact , the IPCC Report is not necessarily . The worst scenario . And there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC and say , &quot; Okay . This is not a big drama . The 
fact is that this uncertainty is supposed to worry us . 
But my dream here is that if you make it economically and at the same time eliminate CO2 . &quot; Then the skeptics also say . Okay . I &apos;m not interested in it emitting CO2 . I almost wish it did . But I &apos;m probably going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . CA 
: And that would be your answer to the BjÃ¶rn Lomborg argument that if you were to spend all this time and energy on the CO2 problem , you would have to solve it . All the other goals , including poverty reduction , are suffering . Fighting malaria and so on , so that it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources . Investing money for it , while there are better things we can do . 
BG : Well , the actual spending on research , let &apos;s say , the U.S. should . 10 billion a year . Expenditure more than you do today . That &apos;s not so dramatic . Underneath 
it , other things should not suffer . 
You get to big amounts of money . And here , reasonable people can disagree . If you have something that &apos;s not economic and try to finance that . For me , this is what &apos;s happening . Most waste . 
Unless you &apos;re very short of a cost breakthrough and you only fund the learning curve . I think we should try more things that have the potential . Very , much cheaper to be . 
If the swab you get is a very high energy price . Then only the rich can keep up . 
I mean , each of us here could do five times as much for our energy without changing our lifestyle . For 
the bottom two billion . But is it a disaster ? And 
even Lomborg thinks about 
his new mesh , &quot; Why is research not going to be discussed anymore ? &quot; 
He &apos;s still being discussed because of his earlier stories with the skeptic camp . But he understood that this is a very lonely group . And so he &apos;s now bringing the research argument . 
And this is a thought that I think is appropriate . 
Research , it &apos;s just crazy . How little support is given to this . 
CA : Bill . I think I speak for almost all the people here . When I say , &quot; I really hope that your wish will come true . &quot; Thank you very much . 
BG : Thank you . 
I &apos;d like to tell you something . What I got a couple of months ago when I wrote an article for Italian . Wired noticed , 
I always wrote my synonymous dictionary . But I was busy editing the text . And I noticed that I &apos;ve never been in my life looking at it . What really hampers the word , I 
read you the entry , 
disabled , adjective , crippled . Helpless , useless , destroyed . Deceased , mutilated , wounded , prepared . Ham , separated , preserved , deserved , weakened , impotent , castrated , paralyzed . Gehandicapt senil , age @-@ weak , withdrawn , repaired , done , broken . Gehnsten , counted , see also injured . Useless and weak . 
Anonyme @ healthy , strong . Efficient . 
I have this list read out loud to a friend and I had to laugh first . It worked so ridiculous . But I just came up to prepared and couldn &apos;t speak any more and had to stop reading . And first of all , collect me after this invincible flood of words and the emotional stuff that goes with it . 
Shock . Of course , this was a fractured old synonym dictionary . I just thought that the issue was pretty old , it had 
to be . But in fact , it was an issue in the early &apos; 80s . When I was just starting primary school , and that started my self @-@ image . Outside my family environment , I started building and shaping . Also , with regard to other children and the rest of the world around me . 
And thank God , I didn &apos;t use a synonymous dictionary at the time , 
I would take this entry seriously . Would I have been born into a world that someone like me would perceive as a person whose lives are not in any way positive ? But today I &apos;m going to be in favor of the opportunities and adventures I &apos;ve experienced . 
So I was celebrating the online edition of 2009 , and I expected that I would be able to find a more appealing contribution here . 
Here &apos;s the updated version . This entry , 
unfortunately , is not much better . 
In particular , the last two words under Near Antonym shake me . All right and healthy . But 
it &apos;s not just about the words . 
It &apos;s about what we think about the people we think about with these words . 
It &apos;s about the values that are in those words , and how we construct those values . 
Our language influences our thinking . And how we influence the world and the people around us . 
Many ancient societies , including Greeks and Romans , really believed that we could have a debate on a curse , a great force , because what we call loud is that what we can manifest . 
So what do we actually want to manifest , a disabled person or a powerful person ? 
People alone , a human being mindless . To call it a child could be enough to limit them and give them ideas . To put 
them over would not be more beautiful to open doors to them . A 
human being who opened doors to me was my pediatrician . AM A.I. DuPont Institute in Wilmington , Delaware . 
His name is Dr. Pizzutillo , an Italo @-@ American whose name , you can imagine , is : Most Americans don &apos;t have the ability to pronounce correctly . So he &apos;s always been called Dr. P. 
And Dr. P. always wore very colorful flies and was responsible for working with kids . Simply made . 
I found the time I was in this hospital , just great . Except my physiotherapy . 
I had to do some exercises , seemingly infinitely often . With these thick elastic bands in different colors . You know that around . Building my leg muscles , and I hated these bands more than anything else . I hated them . I cursed them . I hated them 
and imagine if they were . I even had a child as a five @-@ year @-@ old negotiating with Dr. P. And so this is how I try to stop these exercises . Natural , without success . 
And one day he took me to one of my exercises . These exercises were just tiring and merciless . And he said to me , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young . Girl : You &apos;ll one day tear one of these tapes . 
And if you can do it , I &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot; 
That was , of course , just a simple trick by Dr. P. to do the exercises that I didn &apos;t want to do . With the prospect that the richest five @-@ year @-@ old girl in the hospital will be on the second floor . But he actually got me to do my daily exercise horror with new eyes . So it turned into a new and promising experience . 
And I wonder today how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl . Shaped my self @-@ image , and I could imagine myself as one of nature &apos;s strong , powerful and atlethic people , seeing myself as one of the most atlethic . 
This is just one example of many of how adults are in power positions . The imagination of a child can inspire . 
But like the examples from the synonymous dictionaries already cited , our language doesn &apos;t allow us any room to imagine something . What we all want would be for each and every one of us to be able to see themselves as powerful people . 
Our language lags behind the social changes that , in many cases , are triggered by technological change . From a medical point 
of view , it is , of course , possible to say that my legs , laser surgery for visually impaired visually impaired , knee joints made of titanium and artificial hip joints for aging bodies , which allow people to really use all their possibilities and to transcend the limits that their natural destiny has set them . Not to mention social networking platforms . People allow themselves to have their own identity , give themselves in their own way , define themselves , 
thereby becoming global groups that they are looking for , choosing themselves . 
So perhaps this technological change is clearer . Because ever since , it &apos;s always been a different truth , that every human being in society has something very special and very powerful to give , and that human ability to adapt . Our greatest plus is 
human ability to adapt . This is an interesting story . Because people keep asking me to tell me how to deal with adversity . And I &apos;ll confess something to you : This sentence has . Never fit for me , and I &apos;ve always been very uncomfortable . Feeling with it . People &apos;s questions to answer . And I think gradually I understand . 
Why ? This sentence about dealing with adversity lives from the idea that success or happiness depends on it . To master a challenge . Without the experience that it entails , when it comes to shaping my life as if it had been so successful . Because I &apos;m going to compare the possible traps of a life with a prosthetic . Or anyway , people , with my disability , perceive me . 
But the truth is that we change . Of course , we are shaped by the challenge . Whether you &apos;re physical , emotional or even both . 
And I claim that &apos;s good . 
Adversity is not an obstacle that we need to curve to better understand with our lives . 
Adversity is simply part of our lives . 
And I tend to think of adversity as my shadow . 
Sometimes I realize it &apos;s very present . Sometimes it &apos;s hard to see . But it &apos;s always with me . 
And I don &apos;t want to mean the impact or severity of a human struggle to be reduced . 
There are adversity and challenges in life , and they &apos;re all too real . And every person is different with it . But the question is not whether we can be clear with adversity or not , but how we can get it clear . 
So we &apos;re not just responsible for that . The people we love to save from blows of fate , but also to prepare them for it . All right . 
To be clear . And we &apos;re not doing our kids a favour . If we give them the feeling that they &apos;re not able to adapt . 
You have to clearly separate two things . One is that the medical fact of being amputated and the other is that it &apos;s . The social opinion about whether I &apos;m disabled or not . 
And to be honest , the only real and lasting disability with which I &apos;m dealing is the only real disability that I have had to deal with is that the world is constantly saying . It can connect with these definitions . 
In our desire to protect the people who care about us and to give them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis , or even a prognosis about quality of life , which they expect , we need to do . We need to be careful not to lay the foundation for someone actually being disabled . 
Maybe the current concept is just a focus . What &apos;s broken in a broken , and how we fix it for each individual , a greater disability than pathology itself . 
If we don &apos;t treat a person holistically and not all of his forces and possibilities . And we recognize , in addition to the natural struggle that you may need to fight . 
Another disease . We degrade a person who is responsible for our society . 
So we need to look beyond patology and look at all areas of human potential , 
and focus on this . But most importantly , it &apos;s that there &apos;s a gap between perception of our inadequacies and our great inventive spirit . 
We should not devalue these challenging times or deny them . We should not try to avoid them . We should not try to sweep them under the carpet , but it &apos;s possible . That &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to see in the odds . 
I might rather be interested in making it clear that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome adversity , but that we are open to embracing it , embracing it , hugging it in the head , and also expressing a fight . And maybe even dancing with it . 
And maybe we can do adversity as something natural , coherent and useful , and feel like this through their presence , not anymore , so burdened . 
This year , we celebrate the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin . And when he was 150 years ago writing about evolution , Darwin wrote about evolution , in my view , has something very true in human character . 
I would rewrite it that way , not the strongest of its kind survives . Nor does it survive the smartest of its kind , but the one that can best adapt to change . 
Conflict creates creativity , not just 
from Darwin &apos;s work . Do we know that human ability to survive and flourish from struggle of human mind ? It &apos;s determined to change through conflict . 
So again , change and adaptation are the greatest abilities of human beings . 
And maybe we know only from which wood . We &apos;re carved when we &apos;re really tested . 
Maybe that &apos;s the sense of adversity . A perception of ego . A sense of our own power . 
We can feel something like that . 
We can give adversity a new meaning that goes beyond difficult times . 
Maybe we can see adversity as change . 
Adversity represents a change that we are still not adapting to . 
I think the greatest damage we do to ourselves is to give faith that we 
are normal , that we should be normal . Let &apos;s face it . Who is normal ? 
There is no normal . 
There is the usual , the typical , but not the normal , and would you be this poor , gray person ? Really , you know . You want to learn . If you really existed , 
I don &apos;t think so . It would be great 
if we could counter this pattern of normality against another of the possibilities or the strength , to even a little more dangerous to put it . So we can exchange the forces of very many children . And invite them to share their very special and valuable skills in society . 
Anthropolgen has found that we humans are being led by the members of our society to always have one thing to do : To be useful and to contribute . 
There are indications that even Neanderthals are 60 000 years ago older people and people with human difficulty with physical injuries , with whom they were born . And that might have happened because life experience in these people &apos;s struggle for survival was valuable to society . 
They didn &apos;t break these people as broken and useless . They were seen as something special . And valuable . 
A few years ago , I went to the city where I grew up in , to a food market . In that Red Zone in the northeast of Pennsylvania , and I stood in front of a cup of tomatoes . 
It was summer . And I had shorts . And 
I hear a guy behind me say , &quot; &quot; Well , if that &apos;s not Aimee Mullins , 
and I turn around and see this older man . &quot; I had no idea who he was . 
And I said , &quot; Excuse me . &quot; Sir , do we know ? I can &apos;t get to . You remember . And 
he said , &quot; Well , yeah . &quot; You &apos;re unlikely to get to grips with that . 
I remember when I first saw it , I first looked at it from the belly of her mother . 
Oh , so , he 
did , and of course it did , but click . 
This was Dr. Kean . A man I just made from my mother &apos;s stories about that day . Because of course I was typical of my birthday , two weeks late . 
The doctor for prenatal diagnosis of my mother was on vacation . And so my parents knew the man who gave me birth at all . 
And because I was born without a calf &apos;s legs . And my feet were directed towards them . And I just had a few toes . On this one and a few toes on the other foot , he was the handler , this stranger had to . The bad news has to pass . 
He said to me , &quot; I had to tell your parents that you would never walk and never be so mobile . Would you be like other kids , or you would never be able to live an independent life ? &quot; And since then , they &apos;ve just lied to me . They &apos;ve punished me . Really 
? Exceptionally , I found that he &apos;s collected newspaper clips of my entire childhood . Whether I was competing for a letter in second grade . Whether I was winning with the scouts at Halloween Parade , no matter whether I was on my scholarship or one of my sporting victories . And he used these clips to get his students to teach . Medical students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School . 
And he called this part of his course the X factor , the potential of human will . 
You just can &apos;t stress enough how crucial this factor is to the quality of life of a human being . 
And Dr. Kean went on to tell us . He said , &quot; I learned that if children don &apos;t constantly say something else , and even if they just say a little bit of support , they get a little bit of support . If you leave kids to 
themselves , then kids can do a lot . Look . 
Dr. Kean has changed his thinking . He understood that medical diagnosis and how someone can handle it . Two different things are , 
and so are two different things . I &apos;ve changed my thinking over time . If you &apos;ve changed me at the age of 15 , would you have asked me if I could have changed my prostheses against legs made of meat and bones ? Then I wouldn &apos;t have hesitated for a second . 
I absolutely wanted to be normal at the time . 
If you ask me that today , I &apos;m not so sure . 
And that &apos;s what happened because I have experienced something with my legs , not despite these experiences . 
And maybe that change could happen , because I &apos;ve met so many people who have opened doors to me . Instead of meeting people who restrict me or give me an idea . 
See ? It really only takes a person to demonstrate to you . How they can manifest their forces , and they &apos;re through . 
If they allow someone to create their own inner forces . The human mind is so receptive . If they can do that and for someone at a critical moment , open a door . Then they &apos;re a very good thing teacher for these people . 
They teach them to open doors to themselves . 
The real meaning of the word . Educate is rooted in the word educe . It 
means to create something that is in one that tickles out the potential . Again 
, what potential do we want ? Well , in 
the &apos; 60s , in Britain , a case study was done . Back then , high schools were transformed into schools . 
They call that streaming trials . In the United States , 
we call that tracking , and students are divided into grades . 
And the A students are being tested orally harder . The better teachers , etc . 
, they have students with high school capacity for three months . The grade was very good . They were told . They were aces , they were very smart . And after those three months , they really wrote one . 
And of course , it breaks you down . Hearing the heart that the other way around was told to the students of the one . They 
were just enough . And it was the same after the three months . But only 
those who still were in school , apart from the students who were in school , apart from the students who had thrown the school . 
And the crucial thing about this study was that the teachers were not inaugurated . 
The teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed . 
They were simply told that the Einser students were , and that the students with the grade are sufficient . And they also taught them something . 
And she treats the only real disability is a broken mind . A spirit that was broken has no hope anymore . It finds nothing beautiful anymore . It lacks our natural childish curiosity and our innate ability to imagination . But 
if we can do it , the human mind can help to continue to hope , to hope for itself and other people around it . To find beautiful , to be curious and imaginative . Then we really put our forces into a positive position . 
If a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new forms of existence . 
I want to end with a poem written by a Persian poet named Hafiz in the 14th century . And of which my friend Jacques Dembois told me , and the poem is called &quot; The God Who Words Only Four Words . &quot; Every child doesn &apos;t know God , the God . The name , not the God . The prohibition , but the God Who knows only four words . And this one is repeated all the time . He only always 
says , &quot; Come dance with me . &quot; &quot; Come dance with me . &quot; Thank you very much .
