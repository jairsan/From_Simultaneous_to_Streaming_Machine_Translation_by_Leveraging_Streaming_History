A few years ago here at TED , Peter Skillman presented a design competition called &quot; The Marshmallow Challenge . &quot;
The idea is pretty simple .
Four teams have to have the widest possible freestanding structure with 20 spaghetti .
CA : 1m tape .
CA : 1m thread and build a marshmallow .
The marshmallow has to be up there .
And though it really seems easy , it &apos;s actually really hard .
Because it &apos;s pushing people to work together very quickly .
And so I thought this is an interesting idea .
And I turned it into a design workshop .
It was a huge success .
Since then , I &apos;ve been doing about 70 workshops around the world with students , developers and architects , even CTOs , the Fortune 50 companies .
And there &apos;s something about this task .
What enables deep impressions of the nature of collaboration .
And I want to share some of these with you .
Normally , most people start orienting themselves on the task .
They talk about it .
They think about what it will look like .
They &apos;re rangling for power .
Then they spend a little time planning and organization , they sketch and put spaghetti out .
They spend a lot of their time building up constantly growing structures .
And finally , just before they don &apos;t have time anymore , someone takes the marshmallow and they gently put it .
And they take a step back to the top and TA @-@ da , and they admire their work .
But what happens then almost always is that TA @-@ da becomes an UH @-@ Oh , because the weight of the marshmallow causes the whole thing to bend and collapse .
There are a number of people who have much more UH @-@ Oh moments than others , and among the worst are freshest BWL graduates .
They lie , they cheat .
They &apos;re confused and they really produce poor shapes .
And of course there are teams that have much more TA @-@ DA formations .
And among the best are freshly graduates of the kindergarten .
And that &apos;s quite amazing , as Peter told us .
Not only do they produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
What you might ask is , how does this come about ?
Why ?
What about those ?
And Peter doesn &apos;t tell one .
The kids spend time being the head of Spaghetti GmbH .
They don &apos;t spend time in power struggles .
But there &apos;s another reason , and that is that BWL students were trained to find a real plan .
OK .
And then to realize it .
What happens when you put the marshmallow on top ?
They don &apos;t have time anymore .
And what happens ?
It &apos;s a crisis .
Sounds familiar . What kindergarten kids do differently is they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes .
Successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so they have multiple possibilities to repair dilapidated prototypes .
Constructors recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of an iterative process .
And with every attempt , the kids get immediate feedback about what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
So the performance is to work with prototypes .
But let &apos;s see how different teams operate .
The average for most is about 50 centimeters of BWL students create .
Half of them lawyers , a little bit more , but not much kindergarten kids are better than adults .
Who is the most successful architect and engineer ?
Fortunately , 1m is the highest .
What I &apos;ve seen and why ?
Because you understand triangles .
And self @-@ reinforcing geometric patterns are the keys to building stable structures .
CEOs are slightly above average .
But here it is .
Interestingly , you put an executive administrator .
On the team , they get significantly better .
It &apos;s incredible .
You look around and you see .
This team will win .
You can predict that .
Why is that ?
Because you have special skills in process monitoring .
You run the process .
You understand it and that team .
That regulates and pays attention to the work , the performance of the team will significantly improve .
Specialized skills and process skills and their combination will lead to success .
If you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six that have stable structures .
I tried something exciting .
I thought , let &apos;s get the poker bet right away .
So I offered a $ 10,000 prize for the winners .
What do you think happened to these design students ?
What was that ?
Result .
This didn &apos;t happen .
A team had a stable structure .
If anyone had built a two @-@ inch construction , they would have borne the prize home .
So isn &apos;t it interesting that high betting has a strong effect ?
We repeated this exercise with the same students .
What do you think ?
Well , it happened .
Do you understand the advantage of prototyping ?
So the same bad team , one of the best ones , got out of the same bad team .
They made the highest construction in the least time .
So there are profound lessons for us about the nature of propulsion and success .
You may ask .
Why would anyone actually invest time creating a Marshmallow challenge ?
The reason is , I &apos;m helping create digital tools and processes to help teams .
Creating cars , video games and visual effects .
And what the Marshmallow Challenge does is :
It helps you identify hidden assumptions .
Because frankly , every project has its own Marshmallow .
The challenge is a shared experience .
A common language or attitude to build the right prototype .
And this is the value of this experience .
This is such a simple exercise , and those of you who are interested can .
MarshmallowChallenge .
COM :
Visit :
It &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the Marshmallows .
There &apos;s a step @-@ by @-@ step guide there .
You &apos;ll find crazy examples from around the world , like people optimize and refining the system .
There &apos;s also world records , and the basal lesson , I think , is the construction .
In fact , a connecting sport is that it requires that we all focus our senses on the task and that we use our thinking optimally , like our emotions and our actions , in the challenge that lies ahead of us .
And sometimes a small prototype of this experience is .
Everything it takes us to move from an UH @-@ Oh to a TA @-@ DA moment .
And that can make a big difference .
Thank you very much .
Let &apos;s pretend we have a machine here .
A big machine .
A cool TED @-@ like machine .
And that &apos;s a time machine .
And everybody in this room has to be in .
And you can go into the past .
You can go into the future .
You can &apos;t stay in the here and now .
And I wonder what you would choose because I &apos;ve been asking my friends a lot lately .
And they all wanted to go into the past .
I don &apos;t know .
They wanted to go back to time .
Before there were cars , or Twitter or America , they wanted the superstar .
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re kind of drawn to nostalgia , to wishful thinking .
And I understand that .
I &apos;m not part of it .
I have to say to this group , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go back to the past , &quot; and not because I &apos;m an adventurer .
It &apos;s because opportunities on this planet don &apos;t go back .
They go forward .
So I want to go into this machine .
And I want to go into the future .
This is the greatest time that there has ever been on this planet .
No matter what scale you &apos;re setting , health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , falling rates of disease .
There has never been a time like this before .
My great grandparents all died .
When they were 60 , my grandparents pushed this number to 70 .
My parents are 80 on the heels .
So there should be a nine .
At the beginning of my death there should be a nine .
But it &apos;s not even about people like us .
Because this is a bigger thing than this .
A kid born today in New Delhi can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world .
100 years ago , think about it .
This is an incredible fact .
And why is this ?
Skirts , smallpox , have killed billions of people on this planet .
They &apos;ve redesigned Earth &apos;s demographics in a way that no war has ever done .
They &apos;re gone .
They &apos;ve disappeared .
We &apos;ve defeated them .
Puff : In the rich world , there are diseases that have threatened millions of us just a generation ago .
Hardly any diphtheria yet .
( Rubella )
Patitation knows anything .
Somebody else knows what that is .
Vaccines , modern medicine .
Our ability to feed billions of people .
These are successes of the scientific method .
And in my view , the scientific method is to try things out .
Look , whether it works .
It changes .
If it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
So that &apos;s the good news .
Unfortunately , that &apos;s the good news .
Because there are some other problems .
And they &apos;ve been mentioned many times .
And one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people in the world go hungry to bed every day .
That number is rising , and it &apos;s rising very quickly .
And that &apos;s embarrassing .
And not just that .
We &apos;ve used our imagination to thoroughly devastate this world : Drinking water , primal land .
Rainforests , oil .
Gas .
They disappear .
And soon .
And if we don &apos;t innovate out of this chaos , we disappear .
So the question is , can we do that ?
I think so .
I think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food .
The billions of people will feed without rape the land they live in .
I think we can provide this world with energy that doesn &apos;t destroy it at the same time .
I really think so .
And no .
This is not wishful thinking .
But this keeps me awake at night .
One of the things that keeps me awake at night .
We &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as much as we &apos;ve never done before .
And we &apos;ve never been able to use it sensibly , as we can do today .
We &apos;re on the threshold of amazing , amazing events in many areas .
And yet I really think we need to go back hundreds of 300 years before the Enlightenment to find a time when we &apos;ve been fighting progress where we &apos;ve been more violent about these things , on more fronts than we have now .
People are wrapping themselves in their beliefs so tight that they can &apos;t be liberated .
Not even .
The truth will liberate them .
And listen .
Everybody has a right to their opinion .
Even a right to their opinion on progress .
But you know what they don &apos;t have a right to .
They don &apos;t have a right to their own .
Facts : They don &apos;t have a charge .
And I took a while to figure out , about a decade ago , I wrote an article about vaccines for The New Yorker , a little article .
And I was amazed to encounter resistance , resistance to what ultimately is the most effective measure in the health care sector in the history of humanity .
I didn &apos;t know what to do .
So I just did what I always do .
I wrote an article and I went on .
And soon afterwards , I wrote an article about genetically modified .
Food : The same thing , just bigger .
People were crazy .
So I also wrote an article about it .
And I couldn &apos;t understand why .
People thought that was frankenfood . Why did they think molecules were moving around in a certain way , rather than a random way , an attack on the territory of nature ?
But you know , I &apos;m doing what I &apos;m doing .
I wrote the article .
I went on .
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist .
We type .
We type in .
We go eating .
That &apos;s okay .
But these articles worried me .
And I couldn &apos;t figure out why .
And finally , I found out .
And that &apos;s because these fanatics who made me crazy .
Anyway .
They weren &apos;t fanatics .
They were prudent people , educated people , decent people .
They were just like the people in this room .
And that got me so confused .
But then I thought , &quot; You know what ? Let &apos;s be honest .
We &apos;ve got to a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we used to have .
We talk about it in two ways .
We talk about it ironically , with small quotes .
That &apos;s why progress is .
Okay .
There are reasons for that .
And I think we know what reasons are .
We &apos;ve lost trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself .
And there &apos;s no reason why that shouldn &apos;t be like that .
You can just name a few names .
And people will understand Chernobyl , Bhopal .
Challenger @ Vioxx Weapons of Mass Destruction , the 2000 US presidential election .
I mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
There are questions and problems with the people we thought were always right with .
So be skeptical .
Ask questions : Ask evidence .
Ask evidence .
Don &apos;t take evidence for granted .
But now , if you get evidence , you have to accept that evidence .
And that &apos;s not good for us .
And I can say that for the reason that we &apos;re now living in an epidemic of fear , as I &apos;ve never seen before , and hopefully never again .
About 12 years ago , a story was published .
A terrible story that linked the autism epidemic to the measles , mumps and rubells , vaccine .
Very scary , shocking , shocking .
Studies were done to see if that was true , shoddy .
Studies were to be done .
That &apos;s a serious matter .
The data came in .
The data came in from the United States , from England , from Sweden , from Canada .
And they were all the same , no correlation .
No connection , no connection at all .
It makes no difference .
It makes no difference .
Because we believe in anecdotes .
We believe what we see , what we believe to see , what causes us to feel real .
We don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents from a government agency that gives us data .
And I understand that .
I think that &apos;s what we do .
We all do .
But you know what ?
The result of that was catastrophic , catastrophic .
Because of that fact .
The United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is falling .
That &apos;s scandalous .
And we should be ashamed .
It &apos;s terrible .
What happened ?
That we could do that .
Well , I understand that .
That &apos;s what I do .
Because does anybody have measles here ?
Does one in the audience have a measles ?
The person who sees people die of measles doesn &apos;t happen very often .
In this country , it doesn &apos;t happen at all .
But 160,000 times in the world last year .
These are many deaths from measles , 20 per hour .
But because this hasn &apos;t happened here , we can displace it .
And people like Jenny McCarthy can walk around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like Oprah and Larry King live .
And they can do that because they don &apos;t connect cause and correlation .
They don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never are the same .
And that &apos;s something we need to learn .
And it &apos;s very fast .
This guy was a hero .
Jonas Salk .
He liberated us from one of the worst scourges of humanity .
Don &apos;t worry , no pain , polio .
Puff disappeared .
The guy in the middle , not so much .
His name is Paul Offit .
He &apos;s just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a few other people .
He can save the lives of 400 , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
Very good .
Not .
Well , that &apos;s good .
Apart from Paul walking around talking about vaccines and saying how valuable they are , and that people should just stop complaining .
And that &apos;s what he actually says .
So Paul is a terrorist .
When Paul speaks at a public hearing , he cannot say without armed guards .
He gets calls at home because people like to tell him they know where his kids are going to school .
And why ?
Because Paul made a vaccine .
I don &apos;t need to say that .
But vaccines are essential .
Take them away .
Returning the diseases .
Terrible diseases .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s happening right now .
We have measles in this country now .
And that &apos;s getting worse .
And pretty soon , kids will die of it again .
Because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
And they will not just die of measles .
What about polio ?
Let &apos;s take that .
Why not ?
A fellow militant of mine wrote to me a few weeks ago saying , &quot; She thinks I &apos;m a little too shrill .
Nobody has that .
Ever before , she said she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against polio .
Absolutely not fine .
Why ?
Because we don &apos;t have polio .
And you know what ?
We didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
Today , I don &apos;t know .
Maybe this morning somebody went up in Lagos to an airplane and is flying to Los Angeles .
He &apos;s over Ohio right now and he &apos;s landed in a few hours .
He and he rents a car .
And he comes to Long Beach .
And he &apos;s going to be one of those fantastic things .
TEDDinner tonight .
And he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s infected with a paralyzing disease .
And we don &apos;t know .
Because that &apos;s how the world works .
Well , this is the planet we live on .
Don &apos;t pretend he &apos;s not .
We love to lie in lies .
We love that .
Do you all have that this morning ?
Take your vitamins , Echinacea .
A little antioxidant that helps you jump .
I know you did that because half of Americans do that every day .
You take the stuff .
And you take alternative remedies .
And it doesn &apos;t make any difference how often we find that they &apos;re useless .
The data records that all the time .
They evaporate their urine .
They almost never do that .
That &apos;s okay .
They like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
I totally agree with you : Dark urine , dark .
Why do we do that ?
Why do we do that ?
Well , I think I understand .
We hate the pharmaceutical industry .
We hate too strong a government .
We don &apos;t have confidence in the system .
And we shouldn &apos;t .
Our healthcare system is bad .
It &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
It &apos;s absolutely amazing , cold and soul @-@ reeling , even to us who can afford it .
So we &apos;re walking away from it , and where are we going ?
We &apos;re walking into the arms of the placebo industry .
That &apos;s great .
I love the placebo industry .
But you know , that &apos;s really a serious matter .
Because the stuff is crap .
And we spend billions of dollars on it .
And I have all sorts of little props here , none of them : Gingko fraud , Echinacea fraud , Acai .
I don &apos;t even know what that is .
But we spend billions of dollars on it .
It &apos;s cheating .
And you know what ?
When I say that , people scream at me and say , &quot; What cares you ? Let &apos;s do it . &quot;
People do what they want .
That &apos;s how they feel good .
And you know what ?
They &apos;re wrong because I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the Health Minister .
He says , &quot; Hmm , I &apos;m not going to accept the evidence of my experts on mammography or any cancer quack salver who wants to treat his patients with coffee intakes . &quot;
If you go down that path where faith and magic replace evidence and science .
You get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
You get to Thabo Mbeki in South Africa .
He killed 400,000 of his people because he insisted that red beds , garlic and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know can slow down the course of AIDS .
Hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country .
Worse than any other person who &apos;s plagued by this disease , please don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
They have them .
They always have them .
Now , the most brainless epidemic we &apos;re in is this absurd battle between the advocates of genetically modified foods .
And the bio @-@ elite .
This is an idiotic debate .
It has to stop .
It &apos;s a debate about words about metaphors .
This is ideology , not science .
Everything we eat .
Every grain of rice , every branch of parsley .
Every sprouts have been changed by people .
You know , there were no mandarin in paradise .
There were no cantaloupe melons .
There were no Christmas trees .
We did all of that .
We did it in the last 11,000 years .
And some of it worked and some of it didn &apos;t .
We got rid of what didn &apos;t work .
Now we can make it more accurate .
And of course , there are risks .
But we can do something like vitamin A in rice .
And the stuff can help millions of people .
Millions of people prolong their lives .
They don &apos;t want to do that .
I have to say , I don &apos;t understand .
We reject genetically modified food .
Why do we do that ?
Well , what I hear all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture .
We don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing .
That &apos;s wrong .
We don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
We don &apos;t want companies to own seeds .
And you know what ?
My answer to all of that is yes .
You &apos;re right .
Let &apos;s fix that .
It &apos;s true .
We have a huge food problem .
But that &apos;s not science .
That &apos;s not science .
It &apos;s quite morality , patent crab .
You know that science is not a company .
It &apos;s not a country .
It &apos;s not even an idea .
It &apos;s a process .
It &apos;s a process .
And sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t .
But the idea that we should not allow science to do its work .
Because we &apos;re afraid , it &apos;s a real impasse .
And it keeps millions of people from flourishing .
You know , over the next 50 years , we &apos;ll have to grow 70 percent more food .
When at the moment , 70 percent of that investment in Africa .
In the last 30 years , embarrassing , shameful .
You need that .
And we &apos;re not giving it to you .
And why ?
Genetically modified food .
We don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this rotten stuff , like Maniok .
Maniok is something that half a billion people eat .
It &apos;s like a potato .
It &apos;s just a bunch of calories .
It &apos;s bad .
It doesn &apos;t have nutrients .
It doesn &apos;t have protein .
And scientists are building all this right in there .
And then people could eat it and not become blind .
They wouldn &apos;t starve .
And you know what ?
That would be nice .
It wouldn &apos;t be Chez Panisse .
But it would be nice .
And all I can say about it is why .
Let &apos;s fight that .
I mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves .
Why do we fight that ?
Because we don &apos;t want to push genes around .
It &apos;s not about pushing genes around .
It &apos;s not about chemicals .
It &apos;s not about our ridiculous ones .
It &apos;s about passion for hormones .
It &apos;s about insisting on greater food , better food , unique food .
It &apos;s not about Rice Krispies .
It &apos;s about keeping people alive .
And it &apos;s high time to understand what that means .
Because you know what ?
If we don &apos;t do that , if we keep going as we do .
Let &apos;s be guilty of something we don &apos;t want to be guilty of , I think .
High @-@ tech colonialism .
There &apos;s no other description for that .
What &apos;s happening here ?
It &apos;s selfish .
It &apos;s ugly .
It &apos;s not worthy of us .
And we really have to stop that .
So after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; Do you still want to be in this ridiculous time machine ? &quot;
And go into the future .
Anyway .
I definitely want that .
Right now , it &apos;s in the present .
But we have an incredible opportunity .
We can put this time machine on everything .
What we want , we can move it where we want to move it .
And we will move it there .
Where we want it to be .
We need to have these conversations .
And we need to think .
But if we go into the time machine and go into the future , we will be glad to have done that .
I know we can , and as far as I &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs now .
Thank you .
Thank you .
When Steve Lopez , columnist of the Los Angeles Times , one day walked through the streets in the center of Los Angeles , he heard wonderful music .
She came from a man , an African @-@ American , sympathetic , rough , homeless , playing on a violin that had only two strings left .
Many of you will know the story .
Because from Steve &apos;s article about it , later on , a book was filmed .
With Robert Downey Junior , Steve Lopez .
And Jamie Foxx , when Nathaniel Anthony Ayers , the contrabass player who studied at the Juilliard Conservatory , and whose promising career tragically ended early on with paranoid schizophrenia .
Nathaniel left Juilliard , suffered a nervous breakdown .
And 30 years later , he lived as homeless on the streets of Skid Row .
In the center of Los Angeles .
I recommend you read all the Steves book or watch the movie so you can understand not only the wonderful connection .
The one that &apos;s been created between these two men , but also how the music creates that connection .
Helped .
And how it was , after all , the instrument when this word play is allowed .
That helped Nathaniel get away from the street .
I met Mr. Ayers in 2008 .
Two years ago at Walt Disney Concert Hall .
He had just heard a demonstration of Beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony and came behind the stage to imagine myself .
He talked about yo @-@ yo in a very cheerful and savory tone .
MA : And Hillary Clinton : And about how the Dodgers would never make it into the Baseball World Series .
And all of this because of the insidious passage of the first violin in the last sentence of Beethoven .
Fourth Symphony : We came to the theme of &quot; Music &quot; .
And a few days later , I got an email saying that Nathaniel was interested in violin lessons with me .
I have to mention that Nathaniel refused medical treatment , because he had already been treated with electric shocks and with thorazine and handcuffs .
A trauma that haunted him all his life .
As a result , he &apos;s now particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases .
They &apos;re sometimes so bad that they &apos;re threatening to tear him apart .
And he &apos;s disappearing for days .
In the streets of Skid Row , he &apos;s always wandering around this horror and suffering from torture in his own mind , and in just such a charming stage , Nathaniel was when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall .
He had this crazy flicker in his eyes and he was totally lost .
He talked about invisible demons and smoke and about how someone wanted to poison him in sleep .
I was afraid , not for me , but I was afraid I could lose him , that he could sink into one of his states , and that I could destroy his relationship with the violin .
When I started talking about clay ladders and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin education .
So I just started playing .
I played the first movement of Beethoven &apos;s violin concerto .
And as I played , I noticed that in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes , there was a complete change .
It was as if he was under the influence of an invisible doctor , a chemical reaction of its catalyst .
My game was Nathaniel &apos;s Manian .
Wrath turned into understanding , into a calm curiosity and grace .
And as if by a miracle , he took his violin and began to listen .
Some clips of violin concerts to play and then asked me to finish playing them .
Mendelssohn Chaikovsky , Sibelius .
We started talking about music .
From Bach to Beethoven , Brahms , Bruckner and all the other BS from Bartók to ESA @-@ Pekka Salonen .
And I realized that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but also connected him to it with a close personal relationship .
He talked about her with a passion and understanding that I usually know only of my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic by playing music and talking about music was a paranoid , confused man who was just walking through the streets of Los Angeles , a kind , educated , excellent musician trained in Juilliard .
Music is medicine .
Music changes us . For Nathaniel , music means mental health .
Because music allows him .
It allows him to transform his thoughts and delusions into something real with the help of his imagination and creativity .
And so he escapes his tormenting state .
I understood that this is the essence of art .
This is precisely why we make music so that we can do something deep inside of us all .
Shape our emotions through our artistic lens , through our creativity into reality .
And the reality of that expression reaches us all and moves , inspires and unites us what Nathaniel was about .
So music brought him back to a community of friends .
The redeeming power of music brought him back to a family of musicians who understood him , who recognized his talent and respected him .
And I will play with Nathaniel again and again .
Whether at Walt Disney Concert Hall or at Skid Row , because he reminds me why I became a musician .
Thank you very much .
Bruno Giussani : Thank you very much .
Thank you .

I want to play something that I shamefully stolen from the cellist .
I hope you will forgive me .
I &apos;m Jane McGonigal .
I design computer games .
I &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it just as easy .
Save the world in reality as saving it in online games is .
I have a plan for that .
I want to convince more people , including all of you , more time playing .
Spend bigger and more great games .
We &apos;re spending three billion hours a week now playing online .
Some of you may think , well , that &apos;s a lot of time for games .
Maybe a little too much time .
If you think about how many problems we urgently have to solve in the real world , in fact .
But according to my research at the Institute for the Future , that &apos;s exactly the opposite .
Right ? Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the world &apos;s most pressing problems .
In fact , I &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to dramatically increase that time .
I &apos;ve calculated that the time needed is 21 billion hours of playing time .
That &apos;s a little bit absurd per week .
So I &apos;ll repeat it with that .
It can work if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity .
I have to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours per week by the end of the next decade .
No .
I mean , it &apos;s really serious .
Why ?
This picture is pretty accurate .
Why ?
I think games are so vital to the survival of the human species in the future .
Serious .
This is a portrait of the photographer .
Phil Toledano .
He wanted to capture the feelings of playing .
So he built a camera in front of the players .
This is one of the classic expressions of playing .
If you &apos;re not a player , you may miss some of the nuances .
In this picture , you probably see this sense of urgency , some fear , but also extreme concentration , deeply deepened in solving a really difficult problem .
If you play , you see some nuances .
Here &apos;s the upward @-@ drawn eyes .
And the mouth is a sign of optimism .
The eyebrows show surprise .
This is a player on the edge of what &apos;s called a &quot; edge . &quot;
Epic victory . Oh .
You know that ?
OK .
Great .
So we have some players .
Here &apos;s an epic .
Victory is a result that &apos;s so extraordinarily positive that you didn &apos;t even know before that it was possible at all .
It was almost beyond imagination .
And if you get there , you &apos;re shocked that you &apos;re actually capable of doing that .
This is an epical victory .
This player is about to win an epic victory .
And this is what we have to see on millions of faces of problem solvers around the world .
If we tackle the hurdles of the next century , the face of those who face all odds .
Standing on the edge of an epic victory .
Well , unfortunately , we see this face more in real life .
If we face difficult problems , I call it that .
In life , I &apos;m bad face .
And it &apos;s actually my face .
Look , yeah .
OK .
That &apos;s me .
How I am in life , I &apos;m doing bad face .
This is a graffiti in my former home country in Berkeley , California , where I studied in my PhD thesis why we are better at playing than in real life .
This is a problem .
We think many players are not as good in reality as in play .
And I mean , not only less successful , although that &apos;s part of it .
We &apos;re getting more in play worlds .
I mean , good at motivating us to do something meaningful .
Inspired at working with each other .
If we &apos;re in a game world , I think many of us are turning into our best version , always and immediately ready to help solve the problem , persistent .
Try trying as long as necessary to try it again after the failure .
And in reality , if we fail , if we encounter obstacles , we often feel different .
We feel overwhelmed .
We feel defeated .
We feel threatened .
Maybe depressed , frustrated or cynical .
We never have those feelings .
If we play games in games , they just don &apos;t exist .
And that &apos;s what I wanted to study as a PhD student .
Why is it impossible to think in games ?
You couldn &apos;t just achieve everything .
How can we transfer those feelings from games to reality ?
So I looked at games like World of Warcraft , which is the ideal environment for solving problems together .
And I noticed a few things .
Make the epic victories in online worlds as possible .
So first of all , when you step into one of these online games , especially at World of Warcraft , there are a lot of different characters willing to entrust you with a world saving mission , and immediately .
But not just any mission , but a mission that is perfect to your current level .
In the game , it fits right .
So you can do that .
You never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
But always on the edge of your skills .
So you have to make an effort .
But there &apos;s no unemployment in World of Warcraft .
You don &apos;t sit around and turn around demons .
There &apos;s always something very important to do .
And there are , in a way , employees wherever they go .
Hundreds of thousands of people working with them to complete their epic mission .
That &apos;s what we have in real life .
Not so easy , that feeling that , when you have fingerprints , people are willing to be there .
And there &apos;s this epic story .
This inspiring story : Why are we there ?
And what we have to do is we get all this positive feedback .
You &apos;ve certainly got from level up .
And 1 strength , or 1 intelligence .
This constant feedback is not in real life .
When I leave this stage , I don &apos;t have 1 speech and 1 crazy idea .
20 crazy idea .
I get in real life .
This feedback , not .
So the problem with online collaboration worlds like World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying .
Being on the brink of an epic victory at any time , that we prefer to spend all our time in these game worlds .
They &apos;re just better than reality .
So far , all World of Warcraft players have spent together 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth .
That &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
It may sound bad .
But to see it in context , 5.93 million years ago , it started .
Our first primate ancestors were going to walk upright .
The first upright primacy .
So OK .
So when we talk about how much time we spend playing at the moment .
Does that make sense ?
When do you spend time on the scale of human development ?
Keep in mind what &apos;s extraordinary , but also appropriate .
Because it turns out that by using it all the time , we &apos;re playing .
In fact , changing what we as humans are able to do .
We &apos;re becoming too community .
Thinking , heartfelt beings .
That &apos;s the truth .
That &apos;s what I believe in .
Take a look at these interesting statistics that have been published recently by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University .
The average young person today in a country with a strong playing culture spends 10,000 hours playing online until the age of 21 .
So 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number for two reasons .
First of all , for kids in the United States , 10,080 hours is .
The exact total time they spend in school , from fifth grade to high school completion .
So if you never miss it , we have a complete parallel education path here where young people learn the same way .
What it means to be a good player , like anything else they learn in school .
And maybe some of you have read the new book by Malcolm Gladwell , flying fliers .
So you know his theory of success .
The theory of success of 10,000 hours .
It &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science that if we spend 10,000 hours studying any subject hard until the age of 21 , we will master it .
We will do as well in whatever way as the most important people in the world .
So what we have here is a complete generation of young people .
The master players are the big ones .
So question is , what ?
Exactly , are players masterful ?
Good .
Because if we could figure out this out , we would have , kind of , never before , ever @-@ known human potential at our disposal .
So many people in the world we currently have , who spend at least an hour a day playing online .
These are our master players , 500 million people , who are exceptionally good at something .
And over the next decade , we have another billion players , who are exceptionally good at whatever .
If you haven &apos;t heard it yet , the game industry has developed .
Consoles that save energy and work on mobile networks , rather than broadband Internet .
So players around the world , especially in India .
China , Brazil , playing online is expected .
An additional billion players in the next decade .
So we have a total of 1 .
Five billion players .
So I started thinking about what it is .
What these games are doing to us .
Here are the four things I found .
First , urgency optimism .
OK .
Imagine this as extreme self @-@ motivation .
Urgent optimism is desire to do something right away .
Mastering a hurdle , along with believing that we have a reasonable hope of success .
Players always believe that an epical victory is possible and that it &apos;s always worth trying it .
And that &apos;s the same : Players don &apos;t sit around .
Players are champions in spiders .
Poet social networks .
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research .
They show that we like people more after we &apos;ve played with them .
Even if they &apos;ve defeated us badly .
The reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
We trust that someone spends time with us , that the rules are being respected , that we have the same goal and stay with them until the end of the game .
So playing together allows for the growth of ties , trust and interconnectedness as a result .
We build stronger social relationships , happy productivity .
Fantastic .
You know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of warcraft player plays 22 hours a week .
So as part @-@ time job .
The reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier working hard .
As if we relax or do nothing , we know that we work optimally as human beings .
When we do hard , significant work , and players are always ready to work hard .
When they get the right job , and eventually epic meaning , players love it , part of awe .
Adorable missions to become planetary dimensions .
Here &apos;s a background information to put that in perspective .
You probably know all Wikipedia .
The biggest Wiki in the world .
The second largest Wiki in the world with almost 80,000 entries is :
The World of Warcraft Wiki : Five million people use it every month .
They &apos;ve collected more information about the World of Warcraft online than about any other topic .
In any other Wiki in the world .
They create an epic story .
They create an epic source of knowledge about the World of Warcraft .
OK .
So these are four superpowers that lead to a single result .
Players are super @-@ powerful , hopeful individuals .
They &apos;re people who believe that as individuals they can change the world .
And the only problem is they believe .
They can change the virtual worlds , but not the real ones .
That &apos;s the problem I &apos;m trying to solve .
Edward Castronova is a scientist .
His work is awesome .
He &apos;s studying why .
People spend so much time , energy and money on online worlds .
And he says , &quot; We &apos;re witnessing no less than mass emigration to virtual worlds and online gaming environments . &quot;
And that from an economist , so he &apos;s logical .
And he doesn &apos;t say the way I do .
I develop games .
I &apos;m a little bit exuberant .
So he says , &quot; That actually makes sense . &quot;
Because players can do more in online worlds than in real life .
They can build stronger social ties in games than in real life .
They get more feedback and rewards in games than in real life .
So he says , &quot; It &apos;s perfectly logical right now that players spend more time in the virtual world than in real life . &quot;
I agree .
That &apos;s logical .
But it &apos;s definitely .
It &apos;s not an optimal situation .
We have to start turning the real world into a game .
My inspiration comes from an event .
It &apos;s 2,500 years back .
There are these ancient cubes .
Sheepskin , you know , before these fantastic game econtrollers , there were sheep &apos;s cocks .
And these were , so to speak , the first game tools developed by humans .
And if you &apos;re familiar with the works of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus , you might know this story .
The story about how and why games were invented .
According to Herodotus , games were invented more precisely in the kingdom of Lydia during famine .
There was supposedly such a great famine that the king of Lydia decided to become a crazy idea .
People suffered , people fought .
It was an extreme situation .
It took an extreme solution .
So they invented .
According to Herodotus , the dice game , and agreed a national strategy .
In one day , you would eat .
The next day you would play , and they would be so deeply immersed in the dice game .
Because games are so fascinating and surrounded by satisfying , happy productivity that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
And then the next day you would play .
And the next day you would eat .
And according to Herodotus , they survived this famine for 18 years by eating one day .
And the next day they played , I think .
Let &apos;s put in games today .
We put in games to escape the suffering of the real world .
We put in games to escape everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world .
It &apos;s not satisfying to anything that &apos;s not in real life .
And we get what we need .
From the games .
But that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
That &apos;s the exciting thing .
According to Herodotus , after 18 years of famine , it wasn &apos;t getting any better .
So the king decided to start a final dice game .
They divided the kingdom into two halves .
They played a dice game .
And the winners were allowed to break into an epic adventure .
They left lydia and they went looking for a new home .
They just left as many people as there were food to survive , and they were looking for the rest of a place where they could thrive .
That sounds crazy , right ?
But the latest DNA evidence shows that the Etruscans who later formed the Roman Empire .
They have the same DNA as the old lydians .
So scientists recently came to the conclusion that herodotus , crazy story , is actually true .
And geologists found evidence of global cooling that lasted almost 20 years .
So what the famine could explain could be this crazy story .
Maybe they actually saved their people by playing by fleeing games for 18 years .
And then they had this inspiration and learned so much about playing with each other that they saved the whole civilization .
So we can .
We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft since 1994 .
This was the first real @-@ time strategy game in the World of Warcraft series .
This was 16 years ago .
They played for 18 years .
Craps .
We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft for 16 years .
I &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
So they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world .
So I take my 21 billion hours of play a week .
We should agree that half of us spend an hour a day playing until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world .
I know .
You &apos;ll ask , how do we solve problems of the real world in games ?
And that &apos;s exactly the question I have in my work .
In recent years , I &apos;ve been working at the Institute for the Future .
We &apos;ve got this banner in our office in Palo Alto .
It &apos;s how we should understand the future .
We don &apos;t want to try to tell the future beforehand what we want is to create the future .
We want to imagine the best possible outcome and then empower people to do it .
Transforming that idea into reality .
We imagine epic victories and give people the opportunity to reach them .
I &apos;ll show you very briefly three games that I &apos;ve designed to try and get people epic victories in their own future .
This is a world without oil .
The game is from 2007 .
It &apos;s an online game where you have to overcome an oil shortage .
Oil shortages are invented .
But we have enough online content to make it realistic for you and actually live your real life without oil .
So if you sign up for the game , tell us where you live .
And then you get real @-@ time news movies showing you .
How much oil does it cost , what it doesn &apos;t exist ?
How food supplies are affected , how transport is affected , whether schools are closed .
Whether there are riots .
And you have to figure out how to shape your real life .
If it were true , and we ask you to blog about it , to hire videos or photos .
We tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 .
And we &apos;ve been accompanying them for the last three years .
And I can tell you , it was a changing experience .
Nobody wants to change their lives because it &apos;s good for the environment .
Or ...
Because we should .
But if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and you &apos;re told , &quot; We &apos;re going to get oil out . &quot;
This is a fascinating adventure you &apos;re going to go to .
Find out how you would survive .
Most of our players have kept the habits learned in the game .
So we &apos;re going to go for the next world saving game .
We &apos;ve set a bigger , higher goal than just oil shortages .
We &apos;ve developed the Superstruct game at the Institute for the Future .
The starting point is to calculate a supercomputer that people have only 23 years left on the planet .
This supercomputer is called the Global Dismortality Sensitization System , of course , the call to players to sign up .
Have we almost designed a Jerry Bruckheimer movie ?
You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies , where there &apos;s the dream team .
You have the astronaut , the scientist , the ex @-@ Sträfling , and only together can you save the world .
But in our game , instead of just five people , we say , &quot; Everyone is on the dream team . &quot;
And it &apos;s our job to build the future for energy , food , health , safety .
And the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game .
For eight weeks .
They found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read .
If you Google Superstruct and the last game , we &apos;ll release it on March 3rd .
It &apos;s a game in collaboration with the World Bank .
When you complete the game , you get the World Bank Award for Social Reformer 2010 .
We work with universities all over Sub @-@ Saharan Africa and invite you to learn how to redesign socially .
We have a comic book on this .
We have levels high for regional understanding , knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
I want to invite you all to share this game with young people .
All over the world , especially in developing areas , that benefit from imagining together their own social ventures to save the world .
So I &apos;m going to finish .
I want to ask you something .
What do you think is going to happen next ?
We have all these fantastic players .
We have games that show us what we can do .
But we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
Well , I hope you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a great deal of significance for change .
We have all these superpowers : Happy productivity , the ability to build tight social networks , urgency optimism and the desire for epiepitic meaning .
I really hope that together we play important games on this planet .
Another century to survive .
And I hope you will design and play with me these games .
If I look forward to the next decade , I &apos;m sure about two things : That we can create every imaginable future and that we can play all kinds of games .
So I say , let &apos;s start with the world @-@ changing games .
Thank you .
I &apos;ve been interested in Placebo for some time .
It may seem strange that a magician is interested in it .
Unless you look at it .
Like me , it &apos;s a deception that becomes something real .
If someone just believes in it hard enough , in other words , have sugar pills .
In some studies , a measurable effect has been the placebo effect , just because the person thinks what happens to him is a pharmaceutical or a kind of pain management .
For example , if the patient believes in it hard enough , there &apos;s a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect .
A deception becomes something real , because somebody perceives it so that we understand each other , I want to show you a basic , very simple magic trick .
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works .
This is a trick that has been in every magic book since at least the 1950s .
For kids , I stand for it . I have it from the Cub Scout Magic .
The scout in the 1970s .
I &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
And then I &apos;m going to explain why I explain it .
So you see what happens .
The knife you can look at .
My hand you can look at .
I &apos;m just going to look at the knife like this .
In my fist , I &apos;m going to push my sleeves back .
And to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeves or comes out of it , I &apos;m just going to get my wrist .
Just press it together here .
So you can see that at no time is anything moving .
As long as I &apos;m pressurizing here , nothing can go in my sleeves or come out .
And the goal ?
It &apos;s quite simple .
I &apos;m going to open my hand .
And hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife is held by my bare physical magnetism .
It &apos;s actually so firmly in its place that I can shake it without the knife falling down , nothing wanders into my sleeve , or comes out , no trickery .
And you can study everything .
TA @-@ DA :
Now , this is a trick I often teach small kids who are interested in magic .
Because you can learn a lot about deception .
If you look more closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick to do .
I think many of you here in the room know .
This trick .
It works like this .
I hold the knife .
In my hand .
I say I close my wrist to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeve or comes out .
And that &apos;s a lie .
The reason I hold my wrist is because it &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
The moment I turn my hand away from you so you see it from behind , that finger moves .
Here , my index finger just moves from where it was to a position where it &apos;s stretched out like this . Great trick .
There &apos;s somebody sitting back there who had no childhood .
So he &apos;s right here .
And when I turn around , the finger changes its position .
And now you could talk about it .
Why that ?
A deception is why you don &apos;t realize that there are only three fingers down here .
Because the mind and the way it processes information doesn &apos;t count them individually .
One , two , three , but it sees them as a group .
But that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about .
Now , actually , not at all .
And then open .
I mean , hand .
Of course , it &apos;s held there .
But not by the magnetism of my body , but by a trick .
By my index finger , which is there now .
And when I close my hand , the same thing happens by turning back , it &apos;s hidden by this movement that the finger moves back .
I take that hand away .
And here &apos;s the knife .
This trick you can show to your friends and neighbors .
Thank you .
Now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ?
A year ago or so , I read a study that really cut me around .
I &apos;m not a doctor , right ?
Researchers , and that &apos;s why for me , this was an amazing thing .
Because it turned out to be the following .
If you offer a placebo in the form of a white pill in the form .
An aspirin tablet is just a round white pill that has a certain measurable effect .
But if you change the shape in which you give placebo , for example , to a smaller pill .
And color this blue and paint a letter on it , it &apos;s actually measurably more effective .
And that , though none of them are any pharmaceutical .
They &apos;re just sugar pills , but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
What made me really freak out of that .
But it turned out that &apos;s not all of that .
If you take capsules , they &apos;re even more effective than tablets .
Any shape , a colored capsule , yellow at one end .
And red at the other end is better than a white capsule .
Dosage also plays a role .
A pill twice a day is not as good as three pills .
I can &apos;t remember the exact statistics now .
Sorry , the key thing is that dosage also plays a role .
And the shape plays a role .
And if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to grab the needle .
Right ?
A syringe with an ineffective one .
A few milliliters of an ineffective substance that you inject into a patient .
This creates a very strong image in your head .
This is much stronger .
As a white pill , this graph is really .
I &apos;m going to show you another time .
So if we have a projector , the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work so well .
Like a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle , and none of it has any really pharmaceutical property .
It &apos;s just our belief in it that has a stronger effect in us .
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a magic trick .
I take something that is obviously a deception and make it look real .
We know from that study that you have to grab on the needle .
If you want to get to the point , this is an 18 @-@ inch @-@ long needle .
It &apos;s very , very sharp .
And I &apos;m going to sterilize it a little bit first .
This is really my flesh .
It &apos;s not Damian &apos;s special farmed meat .
This is my skin .
This is not a special effect .
Hollywood : I &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin and drive through it until it &apos;s on the other side .
It &apos;s going to leave again .
If you &apos;re going to get sick when you &apos;re just fainting .
I have a couple of friends .
Last night , I showed it in the hotel room and some people I didn &apos;t know .
And there &apos;s a woman almost fainting .
So I propose , if you get bad quickly .
Then you look away for the next 30 seconds .
Or you know what ?
I &apos;m going to do the first delicate part back here .
You can see it in a moment .
But you can also look away .
So if you want , it &apos;s going to be just where my meat starts .
On the lower part of my arm , I &apos;m just going to make a little bit of a break .
I &apos;m really sorry .
Is it crazy ?
And now , just a little bit through my skin .
And on the other side , again , out again , now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had with the knife trick .
About .
But now you can &apos;t count my fingers .
Or so I &apos;m going to show you .
This is one , two , three , four , five .
Well , I know what people think .
If you see this , you say , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s certainly not so stupid . &quot;
And it just stirs through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes .
Well , then I &apos;ll show you .
What does this look like ?
Very good .
Yes .
I know .
And people back there say , &quot; Okay , I haven &apos;t seen this right .
People in the adjoining rooms are now coming in . &quot;
Let me show you from near .
This is really my skin .
This is not a special effect .
Hollywood . This is my flesh .
And I can turn this around .
Sorry .
When you get bad , look away .
Don &apos;t look at it .
People in the back , or those who will see this on video at some point in the future , will say ,
Well , yes .
It looks pretty impressive .
But if it were real , he would see .
You see , here &apos;s a hole .
And there , if it were really real , it would bleed .
Okay .
Let me squeeze a little blood out for you .
Yes .
Here it is .
Normally I would take out the needle now .
I would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds there .
But I think in this frame here , and with the intention of making something real out of a deception , I &apos;m just going to leave the needle in there .
And so , from the stage , we &apos;re going to meet again a few times in the next few days .
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that .
Thank you very much .
So I &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
I just loved two .
This first one was more like a passionate affair .
It was a nice fish , tasty , good consistency , rich , a bestseller on the menu .
What better fish !
It was bred in aquaculture according to the supposedly highest standards of sustainability .
So you could feel comfortable selling it .
I had a relationship with this beauty for several months .
One day , the company &apos;s boss called and asked if I could talk at an event about the sustainability of the farm .
Of course , I said , &quot; Here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem has become for our chefs .
How do we keep fish on our menus ?
Over the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the seas , how we &apos;ve been barking forests .
It &apos;s hard to overstate destruction .
90 percent of the big fish we love , the tuna , the curative butte , the salmon , the swordfish .
They &apos;ve collapsed .
There &apos;s almost nothing left .
So aquaculture is probably going to become , or bad aquaculture , fishing .
Part of our future will be many arguments against polluting fishing facilities .
The environment , most of you anyway , and they &apos;re inefficient .
Let &apos;s take tuna as a big disadvantage .
It &apos;s got 15 percent feed recovery to one .
That means 15 pounds of wild fish are needed to get one pound of farmed tuna .
Not very sustainable , not very good tastes either .
So here was finally a company .
It tried to get it right .
I wanted to support you the day before .
I called the company &apos;s chief of public relations .
Let &apos;s call him .
Don .
Don , I just said , &quot; To get the facts .
Right ? &quot;
&quot; Do you have a reputation for growing out there in the sea so that you don &apos;t pollute the environment ? &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s true , &quot; he said .
&quot; We &apos;re so far out that the waste is distributed by our fish , not concentrated . &quot;
And then he added .
&quot; We &apos;re essentially a world of our own .
This 2.5 to one feed recovery , &quot; he said , &quot; the best in the industry , 2.5 to one , great , 2.5 to one , what feeds ?
Your sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; Great , &quot; I said , &quot; and that evening I lay in bed and thought , &quot; What the hell is a sustainable protein ? &quot;
So the next day , just before the event , I called Don .
I said , &quot; Don , what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
He said , &quot; He doesn &apos;t know . &quot;
He &apos;s going to ask .
Well , I telephoned a few people in the company .
Nobody could give me a good answer until I finally telephoned with the leading biologist .
Let &apos;s call him also .
Don .
Don , I said , &quot; What , for example , are sustainable ? &quot;
Proteins .
Well , he mentioned some algae and some fishmeal .
And then he said chicken pellets .
I said chicken pellets .
He said , &quot; Yes , feathers . &quot;
Skin , bone meal , residues dried and processed into food .
I said , &quot; How much percent of your ? &quot;
Futters are chicken , assuming maybe two percent .
Now , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
I said , &quot; Don . &quot;
What &apos;s sustainable about feeding chicken to fish ?
There was a long break in the pipeline .
And he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chicken in the world .
I fell in love with this fish .
No .
Not because I &apos;m a self @-@ righteous connoisseur and a good man .
That &apos;s me . &quot;
Even no .
I really fell in love with this fish because I swear to God who tasted fish after this conversation after chicken .
This second fish .
This is another kind of love story .
It &apos;s the romantic species , the way you ever know your fish .
Do you learn the fish ?
The more you love it .
I ate it first in a restaurant in southern Spain .
A friend journalist had long talked about this fish .
She kind of cuffed us .
He came on the table with a bright one .
Almost shimmering white color .
The cook had cooked it .
Hold twice .
Amazingly , he was still delicious .
Who can make a fish taste so good ?
After he was cooked , I can &apos;t .
But this guy can .
Let &apos;s call him Miguel .
In fact , he &apos;s called Miguel .
And no .
He didn &apos;t cook the fish .
And he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that they do .
And I understand it .
He &apos;s a biologist at Veta La Palma .
This is a fish rearing in the southwest corner of Spain .
It &apos;s near the mouth of the river Guadalquivir , until the 1980s .
The farm in the hands of Argentines , they grew meat cattle on what were basically wetlands .
They did this by draining the land .
They built this complicated sequence of canals , and they pushed water out of the country and out into the river .
Now , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not economically and ecologically , it was a disaster .
It killed about 90 percent of the birds , which is a lot of birds for this place .
And so in 1982 , a Spanish company with environmental awareness bought the land .
What did they do ?
They reversed the river of water .
They literally relaid the lever .
Instead of pushing out the water , they used the channels to reconnect the water .
They flooded the channels .
They created an 11,000 hectares .
Fish farming , perch , sea ash , shrimp .
Eel , and Miguel .
And his company , the ecological destruction , completely reversed .
The farm is incredible .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this before .
You &apos;re staring out at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see are flooded canals .
And this dense , lush march .
I was there , not long ago , with Miguel .
He &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts .
Charles Darwin and one part , a crocodile for kissing .
Okay .
We were there and we fought through wetlands .
And I chash and sweat , I have mud up to my knees .
And Miguel keeps calm .
A biology lecture .
Here he highlights a rare track .
Now he mentions the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
And here .
Here he sees a pattern of bundles reminiscent of Tanzanian giraffe .
It turns out Miguel spent most of his career in Mikumi National Park in Africa .
I asked him how he became a fish expert .
He said , &quot; Fish . &quot;
I don &apos;t know about fish .
I &apos;m an expert on relationships .
And then he goes and falls into more talk about rare birds and algae .
And strange aquatic plants .
And don &apos;t get me wrong .
That was really fascinating .
You know , the biotic community , unplugged ?
So , in the way it &apos;s great .
But I was in love .
And my head got weak over this cooked piece .
Delicious fish I had on the eve .
So I interrupted it .
I said , Miguel .
How does it come that your fish tastes so good ?
He pointed to the algae .
I know boy , the algae of phytoplankton , the relationships .
That &apos;s incredible .
But what do your fish eat ?
How is the feed recovery ?
Well , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
The plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton .
That &apos;s what the fish feed .
The system is so healthy .
It &apos;s completely self @-@ explanatory .
There &apos;s no food .
Ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals .
Later on the day , I drove around on this plot with Miguel .
And I asked him .
I said , &quot; For a place that seems so natural , unlike any farm I &apos;ve ever been to .
How do you measure success ? &quot;
The moment it was , a film director asked for a stage change .
And we bowed around the corner , and we had the most incredible sight .
Thousands and thousands of pinkers flamingos .
A literally pinker carpet .
As far as the eye can see .
That &apos;s success .
He said .
Look at her bellies .
Pink .
They &apos;re smuggling , slugging .
I was completely confused .
I said , Miguel , don &apos;t mess your fish .
Yes , he said , we &apos;re losing .
20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to the birds .
Now , last year , on this plot , 600,000 birds were more than 250 different species .
It &apos;s the largest one today .
And it &apos;s become one of the most important private bird reserves in Europe .
I said , Miguel is a good thing .
It &apos;s not a thriving bird population .
The last thing you want to have on a fish farm is he shook his head .
No .
He said , &quot; We &apos;re building extensively , not intensive . &quot;
This is an ecological network .
The flamingos eat .
The shrimps .
The shrimps eat the phytoplankton .
So the closer the belly , the better .
The system , okay ?
Let &apos;s think about that .
A farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , and a farm that measures its success in the health of its predators .
A fish rearing , but also a bird reserve .
Oh .
And by the way , these flamingos shouldn &apos;t even be there from the outset .
They breed in a city 240 kilometers away , where the soil is better .
For nest maintenance every morning , they fly 240 kilometers to the farm .
And every night , they fly 240 kilometers back .
They do that because they &apos;re on the white line yesterday .
The A92 highway can follow seriously .
I had imagined a kind of penguins journey .
So I looked at Miguel .
I said , Miguel , fly 240 kilometers to the farm and fly them .
Then 240 kilometers back in the evening .
Make that for the kids .
He looked at me as if I had just quoted a song by Whitney Houston .
He said , &quot; No . &quot;
They do that because the food is better .
I didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish .
It was delicious .
And I don &apos;t like the skin of fish .
I don &apos;t like it sucked .
I don &apos;t like it crispy .
It &apos;s this biting , charred taste .
I almost never cook with it .
And yet , when I tried it in this restaurant in southern Spain , it didn &apos;t taste for fish skin at all .
It tasted sweet and pure as if you were taking a bite from the ocean .
I mentioned that to Miguel .
And he nodded .
He said , &quot; The skin looks like a sponge . &quot;
It &apos;s the last defense before anything enters the body .
It &apos;s evolved over the course of evolution to suck up impurities .
And then he added , &quot;
But our water has no impurities .
Okay .
A farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish .
A farm that measures its success in the success of its predators . &quot;
And then I realized .
When he says , &quot; A farm that doesn &apos;t have impurities , it undermines enormously . &quot;
Because the water that passes through .
This farm flows from the river Guadalquivir .
It &apos;s a river that carries all the things that rivers tend to do with them today .
Chemical pollutants , outflow of pesticides .
And when it &apos;s fought through the system and it leaves , the water is cleaner than it &apos;s come in .
The system is so healthy .
It cleans the water .
So not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals .
Not only a farm that measures its success in the health of its predators , but a farm that is literally a water treatment plant .
And not only for these fish , but also for you and me .
Because when the water flows out , it sinks into the Atlantic , a drop in the ocean .
I know , but I take it .
And you should do that .
Because this love story , however romantic , is also instructive .
You could say it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food .
Whether we &apos;re talking about beef or meat cattle , what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , of a concept where food actually tastes good .
But for many people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
We &apos;re not realists .
We enjoy .
We &apos;re lovers .
We love weekly markets .
We love small family businesses .
We talk about regional food .
We eat .
Bio . And if you claim that this is the stuff that insure the future of good food .
Does anybody stand up somewhere and say , &quot; Hey guys , I love pink flamingos . &quot;
But how are you going to feed the world ?
How are you going to feed the world ?
Can I be honest .
I like this question .
Not .
No .
Not because we &apos;re already producing enough calories to feed the world more than just feed the world .
A billion people will starve today , a billion .
That &apos;s more than ever before .
Because of stark inequalities in distribution , not total production .
Now , I don &apos;t like this question because it &apos;s the logic of our food system .
Over the last 50 years , what &apos;s been going on is feeding grain to plant @-@ eaters , pesticides , monocultures , chemicals , chicken to the Earth , fish .
And all the time , the agricultural industry has just asked .
If we feed more people cheaper , how terrible can that be ?
That was the reason .
It was the justification .
It was the business plan of American agriculture .
We should call it what it is .
A business in liquidation , a business that quickly takes up ecological capital that allows that very production .
That &apos;s not a business .
And it &apos;s not agriculture .
Our grain chamber is now threatened not by decreasing supply , but by decreasing resources , not by the latest mower and tractor inventions , but by fertile land , not by pumps , but by fresh water .
Not by chainsaws , but by forests .
And not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
They want to feed the world .
Let &apos;s start .
The question is , how are we going to feed ourselves ?
Or better .
How can we create conditions that enable each community to feed itself ?
To do that , don &apos;t look at the agricultural industrial model for the future .
It &apos;s really old .
And it &apos;s done .
Capital , chemistry and machines are at the top of it .
And it never really produced good food .
Instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
This is the one that &apos;s been going on for two billion years .
Work experience .
Look at Miguel .
Farmers like Miguel , farms that are not worlds for themselves , farms that are restoring .
Instead of using up farms that grow extensively , instead of just intensive farmers , who are not just producers , but experts in relationships .
Because they are the ones who are experts on taste .
And if I &apos;m really honest , they &apos;re a better cook .
When I ever be , you know , I &apos;m right .
Because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
Thank you .
I grew up with a lot of stuff .
Science fiction .
In my school days , I went to school by bus , every day , one hour per way .
And my nose was always in a book , a science fiction book .
That kidnapped my thoughts into other worlds and narratives .
That satisfied my deep @-@ seated insatiable curiosity .
And that curiosity also turned out to be that whenever I wasn &apos;t in school , I would always stroll through the woods and collect samples , frogs and snakes and beetles and pond water .
I would bring everything home .
And under the microscope , I looked at it , it was total .
Science enthusiasts , you know , it was always about trying to understand the world and exploring the limits of what was possible .
And my love of science fiction seemed to reflect in my environment .
Because back in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea .
Jacques Cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows showing us animals and places and a world full of wonders that we could never have imagined before .
So that &apos;s probably very good for that .
Science fiction role .
And I was an artist .
I could draw .
I could paint .
And because it &apos;s neither video games nor this saturation with computer @-@ generated films .
And yet , the whole visual language in the media landscape was still there , I had to create the images in my head .
We all had to do that at the time .
When we read a book as kids , we took the author &apos;s description and projected it on the canvas in our heads .
My reaction to that was drawing and painting alien alien worlds , robots , spacecraft .
And all of this in math class , I was constantly caught by the teacher , like I was hiding behind the textbook .
Mint around .
Creativity had to sort of get out of it .
And something interesting happened .
Because what fascinated me about Jacques Cousteaus &apos; shows was the idea of a world that we had never seen before .
Here on our planet .
Even surely I would never reach an alien world with a spaceship .
That seemed pretty unlikely to me .
But here was a world that I could actually enter .
Here on Earth , and it was just as fascinating and exotic .
Like all of the things I &apos;d always imagined .
When I read these books , so I decided ,
When I was 15 , I was divers .
The only problem with this was that I lived in a small village in Canada , 1,000 kilometers from the next ocean .
But I didn &apos;t let myself be discouraged by this .
I annoyed my father until he finally found a diving school in Buffalo , New York .
Right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
I made my diving certificate in a pool of YMCA .
In the middle of winter in Buffalo , New York , the ocean , but I only saw a real ocean two years later .
When we moved to California , since the 40 years that have passed , I &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours underwater .
500 hours of that in submersible boats .
And I &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flatter oceans , is as rich in fascinating life as we can really hardly imagine .
Nature &apos;s imagination knows no boundaries .
It &apos;s quite unlike our own miserable human imagination to this day .
I have the deepest awe for what I see on my dives .
And my love of the ocean continues at the same intensity as ever .
And ever since I was an adult , it was filmmaking .
That seemed the best way to tell my inner urge to tell stories .
It was by my need to create images , to unite .
As a child , I was constantly drawing comic books .
And so films were the way to bring images and stories together .
That was what fit together .
Of course , the stories I chose were from the science fiction field : Terminator , Aliens and Abyss .
At Abyss , I could combine my preference for the underwater world and diving with filmmaking .
So my two passions sort of intertwined .
Something interesting happened at Abyss to solve a narrative problem in this movie .
And that was , we had to create a kind of liquid water system .
Let &apos;s take back computer @-@ generated animation , CG .
What came out of this was the first computer @-@ generated soft surface figure ever to be seen in a movie .
The film didn &apos;t bring money .
In fact , it just played its production costs .
But I noticed something fascinating .
The audience around the world was hypnotized by the magic that came out of it .
Arthur Clarke &apos;s law says , well , advanced technology and magic are no longer to be distinguished .
So you saw something magical .
And I found that incredibly exciting .
And I thought , wow .
It &apos;s absolutely essential to be involved in film art .
So we went much further in Terminator 2 , my next movie .
Together with ILM , we created the guy there from liquid metal .
The success was very much dependent on how this effect would arrive .
And it worked .
Again , we had created something magical .
And the effect in the audience was the same .
But we already have a little more money with the movie .
Recorded from these two experiences , a whole new world had been achieved .
A whole new world of creativity for filmmakers .
So I started a company with my good friend Stan .
Winston , who was the best make @-@ up and creature designer at that time , called Digital Domain .
The basic idea of this company was to skip the phase of analog processes with optical printers , etc . , and to start digital productions in a moment .
And we did that , and we got a competitive advantage for a while .
But in the mid @-@ 1990s , we realized that we were in the Creature and Character Design , which we actually founded the company for .
We were moving too slowly .
I had written this piece of Avatar , which was supposed to shift the bar to new heights in visual effects and computer @-@ generated effects .
With realistic , human expressive characters made using CG .
And the main characters were supposed to be all CG .
And the world was supposed to be CG .
But the bar pushed back pretty much .
And the people in my company told me that we &apos;re not yet in a position to do that for the time being .
So I shifted that , and I made this other movie about the big ship .
This goes down to the studio , and I sold that as Romeo and Juliet on a ship .
It became a love movie of epic proportions , a passionate movie , secret .
But did I actually want to be a real wreck ?
Dive down the Titanic , so I made the film .
That &apos;s the truth .
The studio didn &apos;t know that .
But I convinced them by saying , &quot; We dive to the wreck . &quot;
We film the real wreck .
We &apos;ll show it in the opening sequence of the film .
That &apos;s incredibly important .
It &apos;s a good marketing tag .
And I persuaded them to fund an expedition .
Sounds crazy .
But that &apos;s back to the fact that your imagination can create a reality .
We actually created a reality six months later , where I found myself in a Russian submersible , four kilometers below the surface of the North Atlantic , and me the real Titanic .
And I looked through a bullet .
This was not a movie .
No HD .
This was real .
So this really bypassed me , and the preparations for this were enormous .
We had to build cameras and headlights and everything .
And I noticed how much these deep @-@ sea dive gears resembled a space mission .
Well , yeah .
They were also high @-@ tech and needed extensive planning .
You go up into this capsule .
Then you float down into this dark , hostile environment where there is no hope of salvation .
If you don &apos;t get it back yourself .
And I thought , wow .
That &apos;s just as if I were in a science fiction movie .
That &apos;s really cool .
I was really obsessed .
I was obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
Anyway , of the part that has to do with curiosity and science .
It was all .
It was adventure .
It was curiosity .
It was imagination .
And it was an experience that Hollywood could not give me .
Because , you know , I could imagine a creature for which we could then create a visual effect .
But I couldn &apos;t imagine what I would see outside the window .
In some of the subsequent expeditions , I saw beings in thermal springs .
And sometimes things I &apos;d never seen before , sometimes things that nobody had ever seen before .
And for those who had not found words at the time we saw them , science had not found words at all .
So that really turned me around .
And I wanted more .
And so I made a slightly unusual decision .
After the success of Titanic , I said to myself :
Okay .
I want to put my main job as a filmmaker in Hollywood on ice and become full @-@ time researcher for a while .
And then we started planning these expeditions .
We went to Bismarck and we explored them with robotic vehicles .
We went back to the wreck of the Titanic .
We took small robots that we had built that were carrying out a fiberglass cable .
Our intention was to dive in and look at the inside of the ship , which had never been done before .
Nobody had ever explored the inside of the wreck .
You had no means of doing that .
So we developed the technology we needed .
NA : And
I &apos;m sitting on the deck of the Titanic .
In a submersible boat , I see planks that are quite similar to these boards here .
And of those I know the band once played there .
And I &apos;m flying through the aisles of the ship with a little robot vehicle .
I &apos;m actually just using it .
But my consciousness is inside the vehicle .
It felt like I was physically present inside the Titanic ship wreck .
This was the surreal form of a déjà vu I &apos;ve ever experienced .
Because before I was bogging around a corner , I always knew what would appear in the light cone of the vehicle .
Because I had walked over the movie set for months when we shot the film .
Because the set was an exact copy .
The ship &apos;s blueprints .
So this was a very strange experience .
It made me realize this telepresence experience that you &apos;re using robotic avatars like this .
And so your consciousness into the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
It can be laid , it was really incredibly profound , and maybe a little bit of a view of what might happen in a few decades .
If you have cyborg bodies to explore or do other things .
In all sorts of post @-@ human future scenarios that I can imagine as a science fiction fan .
After these expeditions , we really started to appreciate what we had seen down there .
For example , these deep @-@ sea equals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals .
These are , like , alien animals .
But here on Earth .
They live with chemosynthesis .
They don &apos;t exist in a sunlight @-@ based system like we do .
And so you see animals living right next to a 500 degrees Celsius water cloud .
And you can &apos;t imagine they can survive there .
At the same time , I was also very interested in space science .
This was again the science fiction influence from my childhood .
And so I ended up with the people who are interested in space and who are involved with NASA .
And sit on NASA &apos;s expert board and plan real space missions .
They go to Russia , go through before the mission .
The biomedical protocol , including ,
Everything around it , then fly to the International Space Station and take our 3D camera systems .
That was fascinating .
But in the end , it was going to mean that I took space scientists with us into the deep sea .
I took them and I scaled them into the world .
Down there , astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in such extreme situations .
I took them to the sources so they could look around , take samples and test instruments .
And so on .
We did documentary films .
But actually science , more specifically space science .
So the circle between my existence as a science fiction fan , then as a child , closed .
And implementation into reality .
And as I went on this journey of discovery , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot about science .
But I also learned a lot about leadership .
Now you probably think a director must be able to lead , be a leader like a ship captain or something .
But I didn &apos;t understand much about leadership .
Before I started these expeditions , because at a certain point , I had to say , &quot; What am I doing here ? &quot;
&quot; Why am I doing this ? &quot;
&quot; What &apos;s coming out of this ? &quot;
These stupid movies don &apos;t bring us money .
We &apos;re just playing the production costs , fame , no trace .
Everybody thinks I &apos;ve walked away from Titanic and Avatar and would have cheered my nails on a towel on the beach somewhere .
I &apos;ve made all these movies , these documentary films , for a very small audience .
No fame , no honor .
No money .
What are you doing ?
You &apos;re doing it for the sake of the task , for the sake of the challenge .
And the ocean is the most challenging environment that exists .
You &apos;re doing it for the discovery .
And because of the strange connection that emerges when a small group of people form a team .
Because we &apos;ve done all of this with just 10 to 12 people who have worked together for years and years .
Sometimes we &apos;ve been at sea for two to three months in a row .
And in this community , you realize that the most important thing is respect that you have for each other , because you &apos;ve done a job that you can &apos;t explain to anyone else .
When you go back to land and say , &quot; We had to do it . &quot;
The fiberglass , the sound attenuation , and all around it , the whole technology .
And the difficulties , the human performance .
When you work at sea , you just can &apos;t explain that to others .
This is like policemen or soldiers who have gone through something together .
And you know they can never explain it to anybody .
There &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
So when I came back to make my next movie , Avatar , I tried to apply the same leadership style , which is that you respect your team and in return deserve respect .
And that really changed the dynamics .
So I stood there again with a small team on unknown terrain .
We turned Avatar with a new technology that had not existed before .
Extremely exciting , an enormous challenge .
And we became a real family for a period of four and a half years .
And that changed my way of making films .
Completely .
There were people who thought we had really done this ocean estate .
And transported to the planet Pandora .
For me , it was more of a principled way of doing my job .
The actual process that changed as a result .
So what can we conclude from all of this ?
What lessons have we learned ?
I believe in first .
The curiosity is there .
It &apos;s the most powerful human property .
Our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
And the respect for your team is more important than all the laurels of the world .
I have young filmmakers who say , &quot;
Give me a advice on how to do this . &quot;
And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t restrict yourself , &quot; and others are already worried about you .
Don &apos;t do it for you .
Even bet not against yourself , but take risks for you .
NASA has such a favorite sentence .
Failure is not an alternative .
But in art and exploration , failure must be an alternative .
Because there it guarantees a positive benefit of trust .
No important undertaking .
Innovation has ever been approached without risk .
You have to be ready .
Take risks like that .
That &apos;s the idea I &apos;d like to give you .
Failure is an alternative . Fear .
But is not a thank you .
If I want to bring you one thing closer today , it &apos;s that the whole data we consume is larger than the sum of your parts .
And instead of thinking about overloading information , I want you to think about how we can use information in a way that gives rise to patterns and we see trends that would otherwise not have been visible .
So what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical death chart arranged by age .
The program I &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
It &apos;s called Pivot .
And what I can do with Pivot is I can filter for a certain cause of death .
Let &apos;s say accidents , and immediately I see another pattern that emerges .
And that &apos;s because in the middle , here , people are most active .
And they &apos;re most frail over here .
We can go one step further and rearrange the data , and see that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everybody .
So if we go on and sort out age , we say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are even the main cause that people should be worried about .
And anyone who &apos;s going to study can see that this is particularly true for men .
So you can see that the image of information and data in this way is very reminiscent of swimming in a living information graph .
And if we can do this for raw data , why not for content itself ?
So what we have here are the front images .
Every single Sports Illustrated that has ever been printed .
It &apos;s all here .
It &apos;s all online .
You can test it after my talk in your rooms .
With Pivot , you can dive into a decade .
You can dive into a given year .
You can jump directly to a particular issue .
So if I look here , I see the athletes who are out in this issue .
And the sports , I &apos;m a lance .
Armstrong .
Fan .
So I click here to see what all the issues that Lance Armstrong is mentioned to me are .
Now , if I just want to get a bigger overview , I could think .
OK .
What if I look at everything about cycling ?
So I take a step back and expand the view .
Now I see Greg Lemon .
And so you get an idea of how , if you look through this kind of information , you zoom out more targeted , wider , more pure .
You don &apos;t look for it or surf .
Not just .
You do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
It &apos;s something in between .
And we think it changes the way information can be used .
So I want to take this idea a little bit further , with something like , what &apos;s a little crazy ?
What we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wikipedia page and reduced it to a little summary .
The summary contains a short overview and a symbol of the area from which it comes .
I &apos;m just going to show the top 500 of the most popular wikipedia pages .
But even in this narrow view , we can do a lot of things .
Immediately , we get an idea of the issues that are most popular on Wikipedia .
I &apos;m going to vote on the issue of government .
Now , after I &apos;ve elected government , I realize that the Wikipedia categories that cover most of this are Time Magazines , people of the year .
This is really important .
Because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single Wikipedia page .
It &apos;s only to be seen .
If you go back a step and look at the whole thing , look at a particular one .
So I can then go into the theme of Time Magazines , &quot; People of the Year . &quot;
And all of you see together , now , when I look at all of these people , I realize that the majority of them are government officials .
Some of them come from science .
Some of them come from economics even less .
Here &apos;s my boss .
And one comes from music .
And interestingly , Bono is also a TED Prize winner .
So we can jump and take a look at all the TED Prize winners .
You see , we &apos;re surfing the web .
The first time it &apos;s really a web .
Not only side by side , but much more abstract .
And so I want to show you something else that might be a little surprise .
I &apos;m just going to show you the New York Times website .
Pivot , this application .
I don &apos;t want to call it a browser .
It &apos;s really not a browser .
But you can look at websites with it .
And we bring this zoom technology to every single website like this .
So I can take a step back and jump directly to a specific section .
That &apos;s important because you can only look at websites in this way , look at the whole web process in the same way .
So I can zoom in into my web page in a certain time frame .
So here &apos;s the state of the whole demonstration that I &apos;ve been holding up to this point .
And I can sort of see everything I &apos;ve been looking at today .
I can get back again .
And when I go out and look at everything , I can retrace my web page .
Maybe arrange for my search past .
Here I &apos;ve been looking for nepotistic .
Here &apos;s Bing , right ?
Here &apos;s live .
Labs Pivot
And from here I can go into the page and call it again .
It &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again .
And every time it does the overall picture .
Larger than the sum of the data pieces in the world right now .
Let &apos;s think that data is a curse .
We talk about the curse of the abundance of information .
We talk about drowning in information .
What if we could turn this situation around and turn the Internet upside down so that instead of always going from one to the other , we can start going from many things to many things .
And by doing so , we can see patterns that would otherwise have been hidden .
If we can do this , this data trap may become a new source of meaningful information .
And instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge from it .
And if we know , we may even learn wisdom from it .
That &apos;s what I stop hearing .
Thank you very much .
Everybody talks about happiness today .
I &apos;ve let some people count the number of books published with Happiness in the title over the last five years .
And they stopped after about 40 .
And there were many more .
There &apos;s a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
There &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching .
Everybody would like to make people happier .
But despite all this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps that make it almost impossible , so to speak .
Sure thinking about happiness .
And my talk today will mainly be about these cognitive traps .
That &apos;s true for laymen who think about their own happiness .
And it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness .
Because it turns out we &apos;re just as confused as anyone else .
The first of these traps is to admit reluctance to complexity .
It turns out that the word happiness is simply no longer a useful word .
Because we apply it to too many different things .
I think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could limit it to .
But by and large , this is something that we need to give up .
And we &apos;re going to get the complicated view .
We need to think about what well @-@ being is .
The second case is a confusion of experience and memory .
Basically , it &apos;s between happiness in his life and happiness about his life or happiness with his life .
And these are two very different concepts .
And they &apos;re both thrown together in the notion of happiness .
And the third is the concentration illusion .
And that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about one thing .
Well @-@ being affects without distorting its meaning .
I mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
There &apos;s just no way .
It &apos;s getting right .
Now I &apos;d like to start with an example from someone who had a question and answer session .
After one of my lectures , which was a story , it was unclear .
He said he &apos;d heard a symphony .
And it was absolutely wonderful music .
And at the very end of the recording , there was a terrible , creeping sound .
And then he added , &quot; Really , quite emotionally .
That &apos;s ruined the whole experience .
But that wasn &apos;t what it had ruined . &quot; Were the memories of the experience ?
He had the experience .
He had 20 minutes of wonderful music .
They didn &apos;t count because he had stayed with a memory .
The memory was ruined .
And the memory was everything he had been given to keep .
What this really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and about other people .
In the sense of two kinds of self .
There is a living self that lives in the present .
And the present knows how to experience the past again .
But basically , only the present has it . It &apos;s the living self that the doctor instigates .
You know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Is it hurting now ? &quot;
When I touch you here .
And then there &apos;s a remembering self .
And the remembering self is that that &apos;s what mitzählt .
And keeps the story of our lives upright .
And it &apos;s the one that the doctor addresses by asking the question .
How did you feel lately ?
Or how was your journey to Albania or something like that ?
These are two very different units .
The living self .
And the remembering self .
And confusing the two is part of the coexistence of the term happiness .
Now , the remembering self is a storyteller .
And that really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memories .
It starts immediately .
We &apos;re not just telling stories .
When we make ourselves tell stories .
Our memory tells us stories .
That means what we can keep from our experiences is a story .
And let &apos;s start with an example .
There &apos;s an old study .
These are real patients who undergo a painful procedure .
I &apos;m not going to go into detail .
It &apos;s no longer painful today .
But it was painful .
When this study was done in the 1990s , they were asked to report every 60 seconds about their pain .
And here are two patients .
These are their records .
And they &apos;re asked , who has suffered more from both ?
And this is a very simple question .
Patient B has suffered more clearly .
His intestinal reflection was longer .
And every minute of pain .
Patient A had patient B and more .
But now there &apos;s another question : How much did you think ?
These patients that they suffered ?
And here &apos;s a surprise .
And the surprise is that patient A had a much worse reminder of intestinal reflection .
When patient B had the stories of intestinal reflections , different things were different .
And because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
And none of these stories is very edible or great .
But one of them is clear .
But one of them is significantly worse than the other , and the one that is worse was where the pain was at its peak at the very end .
It &apos;s a bad story .
How do we know that ?
Because we asked these people about their spinal reflections , and much later .
How bad was the whole thing ?
And it was much worse for A than for B in memory .
Well , this is a direct conflict between the living self and the remembering .
Even from the perspective of the living self , B clearly had a worse time .
Now , what you could do with patient A .
And we actually did clinical experiments .
And it was done .
And it works .
You could actually extend patient A &apos;s intestinal reflection by just leaving the tube in there .
Without too much shake on it .
That will cause the patient to suffer , but only a little bit less than before .
And if you do that for a few minutes , you &apos;ve made the living person worse off even patient A .
And you &apos;ve made the memory self of patient A much better off .
Because now you &apos;ve given patient A a better story about his experience .
What does a story look like ?
And that &apos;s true of the stories that memory gives us .
And it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent .
What makes a story look like is upheavals , significant moments and ends .
Ends are very , very important .
And in this case , the end dominated .
Now , the living self is constantly living its life .
It has moments of experience one after the other .
And you ask , what happens to these moments ?
And the answer is really simple .
They &apos;re lost forever .
I mean , most moments of our lives .
And I &apos;ve calculated that .
You know , the psychological presence is considered for about three seconds .
What does it mean ? Do you know that there are about 600 million of them in a life ?
In a month , there are about 600,000 .
Most of them leave no trace .
Most of them are completely ignored by the memory self .
And yet , somehow , they get the impression that they should count .
That what happens during these moments of experience .
Our life is it &apos;s the limited resource that we consume while we &apos;re in this world , and how we consume it would seem important .
But that &apos;s not the story that keeps the memory self for us .
So we have the memory self .
And the living self .
And they &apos;re really quite different .
The biggest difference between them is the way that time is handled from the perspective of the living .
Even if you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good as the first week .
Then the two @-@ week holiday is twice as good as the one @-@ week holiday .
That &apos;s not how it works at all .
For the remembering self , for the remembering self , a two @-@ week holiday is hardly better than a one @-@ week holiday .
Because there are no new memories added .
You haven &apos;t changed the story .
And in this way , time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from a living one .
Even time has very little influence on this story .
Now , the remembering self makes more than remembering and telling stories .
It &apos;s actually the one .
It makes decisions .
Because if you have a patient who , let &apos;s say , had two intestinal reflections with two different surgeons and decided which to choose .
Then is the one who chooses the one who has the memory that &apos;s less bad .
And that &apos;s the surgeon who will be selected .
The living self has no voice in that choice .
We actually don &apos;t choose between experiences .
We choose between memories of experiences .
And even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t normally think about our future as experiences .
We think about our future as anticipated memories .
And basically , you can look at that .
You know , as a tyranny of the memory self .
And you can think of the memory self as one .
So , the living self is dragging through experiences that the living self doesn &apos;t need .
I have the impression that when we go on vacation , it &apos;s very often the case .
That means we go on vacation , as far as possible , at the service of the memory self .
And that &apos;s a little hard to justify , I think .
I mean , how much do we feed from our memories ?
That &apos;s one of the explanations given for the dominance of the memory self .
And when I think about that , I think about a vacation we made a few years ago in Antarctica that was clearly the best vacation I &apos;d ever had .
And I think relatively often about how often I think about other vacations .
And I probably have my memories of this three @-@ week journey .
I would say , for about 25 minutes , I &apos;ve been driving in the last four years .
Now , if I &apos;d ever opened the folder with the 600 images in it , I &apos;d spent another hour .
Now , that &apos;s three weeks .
And that &apos;s at most .
One and a half hours .
There seems to be disagreement .
Now , I like to be a little extreme .
You know , in it , how little appetite I have for feeding memories .
But even if you do more of that , there &apos;s a real question .
Why do we give memories so much weight in the scourge to the weight that we give experiences ?
So I want you to think about a thought experiment .
Imagine your next vacation .
You know that at the end of your vacation , all your pictures are destroyed .
And you get an amnesty drug , so you don &apos;t remember anything .
Now , you would choose the same vacation .
And if you chose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two kinds of self .
And you have to think about how you decide this conflict .
And that &apos;s really not obvious at all .
Because if you think about time , you get an answer .
And if you think about memories , you could get a different answer .
Why choose the vacations that we choose is ?
A problem that confronts us with a choice between the two types of self .
Now , the two kinds of self throw two terms of happiness .
There are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply : One per self .
So you can ask , how happy is the living self ?
And then you would ask , how happy are the moments in the life of the living self ?
And you &apos;re all happiness .
For moments , it &apos;s a pretty complicated process .
What are the emotions that can be measured ?
And by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea .
From happiness of the living self over time .
If you ask about happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
It &apos;s not about how happy .
A person lives .
It &apos;s about how satisfied or happy .
The person is when that person thinks about his life .
Very different .
The notion of anyone who doesn &apos;t distinguish these terms will mask the exploration of happiness .
And I &apos;m a lot of researchers about well @-@ being who have long masked the exploration of happiness .
In that very way , the distinction between the happiness of the living self .
And the happiness of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years .
And now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separately .
The Gallup Organization has a global survey that asked more than half a million people questions about what they think about their lives and their experiences .
And there have been other efforts in the direction .
So in recent years , we &apos;ve started learning about the happiness of the two kinds of self .
And the main lesson we &apos;ve learned , I think , is that they &apos;re really different .
You can know how satisfied someone is with his life .
And that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happy he lives his life .
And vice versa .
Just to give you an idea of the correlation .
The correlation is about five percent .
What that means is that if you hit someone , and you would tell them , &quot; Oh , his father is a two @-@ meter man . &quot;
How much would you know about his height ?
Well , you would know about his size .
But there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
You have so much uncertainty .
If I tell you that somebody has classified his life as eight on a scale of 10 .
Do you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self ?
So the correlation is low .
We know something about what determines happiness self .
We know money is very important .
Targets are very important .
We know happiness is basically about being satisfied with people we like to spend time with people we like .
There &apos;s other pleasure .
But that &apos;s dominant .
So if you want to maximize happiness of the two kinds of self .
Will you end up doing very different things ?
The conclusion from what I said here is that we really shouldn &apos;t imagine happiness as a substitute for well @-@ being .
It &apos;s a completely different term .
Now , very briefly .
Another reason why we can &apos;t think clearly about happiness is that we don &apos;t care about the same things .
When we think about life and when we actually live .
So if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California .
Will they not get the right answer ?
If you ask that question , do they think that people in California need to be happier ?
If you say we live in Ohio ?
And what happens is that if you think about life in California , think about the difference between California and other places .
And that difference is , say , climate .
Well , it turns out climate is not very important to the living self .
And it &apos;s not even very important to the thoughtful self .
That decides how happy people are .
Now , because the thoughtful self is responsible , you can end up .
Some people could end up moving to California .
And it &apos;s kind of interesting to track .
What happens to people moving to California in the hope of becoming happier ?
Well , their living self won &apos;t get happier .
We know that .
But one thing will happen .
You &apos;ll think you &apos;re happier .
Because if you think about it , you &apos;ll be reminded of how terrible the weather was in Ohio .
And you &apos;ll feel you &apos;ve made the right decision .
It &apos;s very difficult to think clearly about well @-@ being .
And I hope I &apos;ve given you an idea of how difficult it is .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
I have a question for you .
Thank you very much .
Now , when we telephoned a few weeks ago , you told me that there was a pretty interesting result that came from this Gallup survey .
Is that something you can share with us ?
Because you now have a few minutes left .
Daniel Kahneman : Sure . I think the most interesting result we found in the Gallup survey is a number that we had absolutely not expected to find .
We found that in terms of happiness for the survivor himself .
When we looked at how feelings vary with income , and it turns out that under an income of 60,000 dollars a year for Americans .
And this is a very large sample of Americans , about 600,000 .
But it &apos;s a big representative sample of an income of 600,000 dollars a year .
About 60,000 .
DK : 60,000 .
000 .
60 .
000 .
Dollar
In the year , people are unhappy .
And they &apos;re getting increasingly unhappy .
The poorer they get , we get an absolutely flat line about it .
I mean , I rarely saw such flat lines .
What happens is obviously that money doesn &apos;t raise happiness from an experience .
But that lack of money certainly creates misery .
And we can measure this misery very , very clearly .
In the sense of the other self , the memory self , you get a different story .
The more money you make , the more satisfied you are .
That &apos;s not true of emotions .
CA : But Danny , throughout the American endeavor , it &apos;s about life , freedom .
The aspiration for happiness .
If people were to take this finding seriously , I think it seems to turn everything on their head .
Everything we believe , for example , in tax policy .
And so on , there &apos;s a chance that politicians , that the country would generally take a finding like the seriousness .
And based on that , politics would do it .
DK : You know ?
I think there &apos;s recognition for the role of gambling research in politics .
Recognition will be slow .
In the United States , no question .
But in the United Kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now .
And in other countries , it &apos;s happening right now .
People are recognizing that they should think about happiness .
When you think about politics , it &apos;s going to take a while .
And people will discuss whether they want to explore experience happiness or whether they want to explore life assessment .
So we need to have this discussion pretty soon , how to increase happiness .
It &apos;s very different .
Depending on how you think .
And whether you think about the memory self , or whether you think about the living self .
That &apos;s what politics is going to be .
I think it &apos;s going to be influencing .
In the coming years in the United States , you &apos;re going to be tightening on the happiness of the people .
That &apos;s going to be part of national statistics , I think , in the next one or two decades .
CA : Well , it seems to me that this topic is going to , or should , be at least the most interesting political debate to follow .
Over the next few years .
Thank you very much .
For the invention of behavioral economics .
Thank you .
Danny Kahneman : Today I &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
And that might surprise you a little bit , because my full @-@ time work at the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds , about the things we need to invent and deliver to enable the poorest two billion to live better .
But energy and climate are extremely important to these people .
In fact , even more important than any other on the planet .
Climate degradation means that their seeds will not grow for many years , we will rain too much or too little .
Things will change as their fragile environment cannot endure .
That leads to starvation .
It leads to insecurity .
It leads to unrest .
So climate change will become terrible for them .
And also , the energy price is very important for them .
The fact is , if you could just reduce the price from one thing .
To reduce poverty , energy would be by far the most effective .
Now , the energy price has fallen over time .
In fact , the progress society is based on energy progress .
Coal evolution drove the Industrial Revolution .
And even in the 20th century , there was a rapid fall in the electricity price .
And so we have refrigerators , air conditioning .
We can make modern materials and do so many things .
So we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
But if we reduce the price , we can halve the price .
Let &apos;s hit a new barrier .
And this barrier is related to CO2 .
CO2 warms the planet , and the equation for CO2 is actually pretty clear .
They sum up the CO2 emitted , which leads to temperature increase .
And this temperature increase has some very negative effects on the weather .
And perhaps worse , the indirect consequence is that natural ecosystems cannot adapt to such rapid changes .
And so whole systems collapse .
Now , the exact link between a CO2 increase and the resulting temperature change , and where its further consequences lie .
There are some ambiguities .
But not very many .
And there &apos;s certainly uncertainty about how bad these consequences will be .
But they will be extremely bad .
I &apos;ve asked the top scientists several times , &quot; Do we really have to get down to near zero ? &quot;
&quot; Is that enough ? &quot;
Not half .
Or a quarter .
The answer is until we get close to zero .
Will the temperature continue to rise ?
So it &apos;s a big challenge .
It &apos;s quite different from saying we have a 3.5 @-@ meter truck that has to come under a three @-@ meter bridge .
You can squeeze that down below .
This has to be down to zero .
Well , we emit a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons .
Every American , about 20 tons of people from poor countries , less than one , on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
And somehow we have to create changes that reduce that to zero .
It &apos;s been constantly increasing .
Just different economic ones .
Changes have actually affected it .
And we have to go from rapid growth to reduction and to a reduction to zero .
This equation has four factors .
A little multiplication .
You have this thing on the left , CO2 , that you want to get to zero .
And that will depend on the number of people , on the services that every human being uses on average , the average energy for every service , and the CO2 emitted per unit of energy .
So let &apos;s look at each factor individually .
And let &apos;s think about how we get that to zero .
Probably one of these numbers has to come very close to zero .
Now , this is basic algebra .
But let &apos;s go through it .
First of all , we have the population today .
6.8 billion people , and it &apos;s going to reach 9 billion , moving to 9 billion .
If we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , health care and reproductive medicine .
Could we reduce that by 10 to 15 percent ?
But right now , we &apos;re seeing a 1.3 percent slope .
The second factor is the services we use .
That includes all the food we eat : Clothing , television , heating .
These are very good things .
And poverty reduction means making these services accessible to almost everyone on the planet .
It &apos;s great that this number is rising in the rich world , in the top billion , we might be able to make cuts and use less .
But on average , this number is going to rise every year , and so it &apos;s more than doubling overall .
The number of services that are provided per person .
So here &apos;s a very basic service .
Is there light at home to read the homework ?
And these students don &apos;t have it .
So they go out and read their homework under the street light .
Now , effectiveness , the E : The energy per service , finally there &apos;s good news .
We have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
Because of different successes in the lighting sector , because of other types of cars , because of new methods in building houses .
There are many services that you can drastically reduce their energy consumption .
You can drastically reduce that . 103.00 , 05.50 , 000 GT , 00.05 , 53,000 .
Some services can be reduced by 90 % .
Some services can be reduced by 90 % .
Other services , such as fertilisers ( 105.00 , 05.56 , 000 GT , 00.05 , 58.000 ) or air transport or air transport , have a much smaller overall room for improvement .
If we are optimistic , we may get a 3 factor reduction , or maybe even a 6 factor reduction .
But in the first three factors , we &apos;re now from 26 billion to 26 billion .
Maybe the very best 13 billion tons have gone .
And that &apos;s just not enough .
So let &apos;s look at the fourth factor .
And this will be a key factor .
That &apos;s the amount of CO2 per unit of energy .
It &apos;s emitted .
The question is , can you get that to zero ?
If you burn coal , no , if you burn natural gas , no , almost every method of producing electricity emits .
Today , CO2 , except renewable energy and nuclear energy .
So what we need to do at a global level is create a new system .
We need energy under .
Now , if I use the term &quot; miracle , &quot; I don &apos;t mean the impossible .
The microprocessor is a miracle .
The PC is a miracle , the Internet , and its services are a miracle .
People here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
Normally , there &apos;s no deadline for you to need a miracle by a certain date .
Normally , you &apos;re just standing by .
And some don &apos;t come .
But in this case , we have to give full gas .
And get a miracle in a very short time .
Well , I wondered , how can I really get this over ?
Is there a natural illustration ?
A demonstration that sparks the idea of people here .
I remembered .
Last year , when I brought mosquitos , and somehow people liked that .
The idea became really tangible to them .
You know , there are people who live with mosquitos , for energy fell .
I got this one .
I decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment this year .
So here are some natural fireflies .
I &apos;ve been assured they &apos;re not biting .
In fact , they &apos;re not even going to leave the glass .
Well , there are all kinds of game solutions like this .
But they &apos;re not all doing much .
We need solutions .
Either one or more of them have unimaginable scaling and unimaginable reliability .
And although there are many directions where people are looking for it , I really see only five of them who can make these big demands .
I &apos;ve omitted tides , geothermal fusion and biofuels .
They may make a moderate contribution .
And if they do better than I expect , that would be great .
But my key message here is that we need to work on all of those five .
And we can &apos;t give up on them because they intimidate us .
Because everybody has significant problems .
Let &apos;s first look at them .
Burning fossil fuels , burning either coal or natural gas .
What you have to do there may seem simple .
But that &apos;s not it .
You have to capture all the CO2 that comes out of the chimney after it &apos;s burned , under pressure , liquefied .
And then store somewhere and hope it stays there .
There are some pilot projects that can do that at a 60 / 80 level , but getting it to 100 .
It &apos;s going to be very difficult to get an agreement on the storage of CO2 , and it &apos;s a big challenge .
But the biggest problem here is the storage time issue .
Who will make sure ?
Who can guarantee something ?
What literally is many billion times larger than any kind of waste you can imagine about nuclear and other things .
That &apos;s a lot of volume .
So this is a hard nut .
Next , nuclear energy , which also has three major problems .
The cost , especially in highly regulated countries , is high .
The question of security , that you really feel that nothing can go wrong .
Despite human cooperation , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
And then what do you do with the waste ?
Because although it &apos;s not very big , there are a lot of concerns .
People have to feel good about it .
184,00 , 10 , 20,000 GT , 00 , 10 , 25,000 .
So three very difficult problems .
So they may be solvable , so three very difficult problems .
They may be solvable , and they should work on them .
So I summarized the last three of the five .
They &apos;re renewable energy , as they &apos;re often called .
And they also have , although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel .
They have some disadvantages .
One is that the energy density that these technologies generate is dramatically lower than that of power plants .
These are low @-@ energy energy .
You talk about many square kilometers more space than a normal power plant .
And these sources are also subject to interruptions .
The sun doesn &apos;t shine all day long .
It doesn &apos;t shine every day either .
And the wind blows the same way .
Not all the time .
So if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , you have to have a way to do that , even in times .
If it &apos;s not available to get it .
So there are big price challenges here .
There are challenges in transmission .
For example , if we say that the energy source is outside the country , it &apos;s not just technology that you need .
You also have to deal with the risk that the energy comes from where it comes from .
And there &apos;s the storage problem .
And to show the dimension , I have all kinds of batteries .
They &apos;re made , looking at cars , computers , mobile phones , flashlights for everything .
And I &apos;ve compared that to the amount of electronic energy that the world uses .
I found that all the batteries that we &apos;re now producing .
We could store less than 10 minutes of total energy .
So we need a big breakthrough here , something that will be 100 percent better than the approaches at the moment .
It &apos;s not impossible .
But it &apos;s not that easy .
That &apos;s what happens when you try to tell these interrupted sources about .
We &apos;re going to bring 20 to 30 percent of consumption .
If you want to rely on it 100 percent , you need an incredible wonder battery .
Now where are we going to go ?
What &apos;s the right approach ?
A Manhattan project .
How do we get to the finish line ?
What we need is a lot of companies .
They &apos;re working on it .
Hundreds of people in each of these five areas need at least 100 people .
For many , they &apos;ll say , &quot; They &apos;re crazy . &quot;
That &apos;s good .
I think here at TED .
There are many people who are already engaged in this .
Bill Gross has several companies , including one called Esolar .
The great solar thermal technologies have invested Vinod Khosla in dozens of companies .
They do great things and have interesting opportunities .
And I &apos;m trying to support that .
Nathan Myhrvold and I are funding a company that maybe surprisingly has a nuclear approach .
There are some innovations in the nuclear sector : Modular , liquid .
The development in this industry stopped some time ago .
So it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are lying around .
The Terrapower concept means that instead of a part of the uranium , you &apos;re the one percent .
The U235 : We decided to burn the 99 .
The U238 .
This is a pretty crazy idea .
But in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time .
But you could never reasonably simulate whether it would work .
But since there are modern supercomputers , you can simulate it and see that , yes , with the right approach to matter , it looks like it works .
And because you burn these 99 , the cost profile is much better .
In fact , you burn the garbage , and you can even burn the garbage from today &apos;s reactors .
As a drive , rather than breaking your head over it , they just burn it . A great thing .
The uranium is being used gradually .
A little bit like a candle .
You can see that it &apos;s a kind of column .
It &apos;s often called a wandering wave , reactor .
It really solves that .
The fuel problem .
Here &apos;s a picture of a place in Kentucky .
That &apos;s the waste , the 99 percent .
You have the part that &apos;s burned today .
You have taken it out .
So it &apos;s called depleted uranium .
That &apos;s what drives the U.S. for hundreds of years .
And if you filter ocean water cheaply and easily , you get enough fuel for the rest .
Life of the planet .
You know , there are many challenges there .
But it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward .
Let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
What should our testimony look like ?
Well , we go to the goal that we need to achieve .
And then we talk about the intermediate step .
Many talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
It &apos;s really , really important that we get there , the remaining 20 percent .
Poor countries are still producing agriculture .
Hopefully forest threats and cement will be clean by then .
So to achieve that 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like China , needs to completely transform their generation of electricity .
The other note says whether we &apos;re using zero emissions technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to getting it to the rest .
That &apos;s super important .
That &apos;s going to be a key element .
That certificate , if we go back from there .
What should that 2020 certificate look like ?
It should contain the two elements again .
We should use the effectiveness measures to get reduction going .
The less we emit , the less CO2 we emit .
And so will the temperature .
But actually , this note is the same for the things we do , which don &apos;t completely lead to the big reductions , or even a little less important than the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
We have to track these breakthroughs with full @-@ gas .
And we can measure that .
In company numbers , in pilot projects and regulatory changes .
There are many great books on this subject .
The Al Gore book .
We have the choice , and David McKay &apos;s Sustainable Energy Without The Hot Air .
They really go through it and create a framework where this can be widely discussed .
Because we need support from all sides to do that .
There are a lot .
There &apos;s a need for this coming together .
That &apos;s a wish .
A very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
If you will allow me just one wish for the next 50 years .
I could choose the president , a vaccine , and that &apos;s what I love .
I or I could choose that wish .
That &apos;s half the energy price .
Without CO2 , it &apos;s invented .
That &apos;s what I would like to see . This one has the greatest impact .
If we don &apos;t get that wish , the gap between long @-@ term and short @-@ term thinking will be .
People will be terrible between the United States and China , between poor and rich countries .
And almost all of them will live on these two billion , and they will be much worse .
So what do we have to do ?
What action do I appeal for ?
We have to work for more research funding .
When countries meet in places like Koppenhagen , they should not just talk about CO2 .
They should discuss this innovation strategy .
And they would be shocked by the ridiculously low money spent on these innovative approaches .
We need market incentives , carbon taxes .
Cap &amp; amp ; Trade , something that sends a price signal .
We need to spread the news .
We need to have dialogue more rational and complete .
And also the things that the government is doing .
It &apos;s an important wish .
But I think we can fulfill it .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Just to get Terrapower a little better .
First of all , you can give us an idea .
The scale of this investment Bill Gates is giving to do the simulation on a supercomputer .
Getting all the big scientists what we &apos;ve done .
Do we need just a few 10 million ?
And even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a Russian reactor to make sure it works properly , you &apos;re only in the 100 million .
The difficult step is to build the first reactor , find billions more .
The regulations and the place that actually builds the first one .
Once the first one is finished , when it &apos;s going as promised , it &apos;s all very clear .
Because the economic viability , the energy density , is as different as we are with nuclear energy .
You know about it , to understand it correctly .
That means building deep into the ground .
It &apos;s almost like a vertical pillar of nuclear fuel , this consumed uranium .
And then the process begins .
Up there , it continues to work down .
BG : Right now , you have to refill the reactor .
So there are lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong .
This thing , where you open it and bring things in or out .
That &apos;s not good .
But if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years .
Think of a column that you bury without all the complexities .
And it sits there and burns for 60 years .
And then it &apos;s done .
CA : A nuclear reactor that itself provides a solution to the garbage .
BG : Yeah .
Now what happens to the garbage ?
You can let it sit .
There &apos;s much less garbage .
With this method , then you take it and grab it .
In the next reactor , you burn it further .
And we start by taking the garbage that already exists , which is in these cooling basins or dry tanks , at the reactors .
That &apos;s our starting fuel .
So what was a problem for these reactors is what we fill in .
And that dramatically reduces the garbage volume .
During this process , about , but during the process , you talked to different people in the world about these possibilities .
Where is that ?
The biggest interest .
So , to actually implement this .
BG : Well , we haven &apos;t yet set ourselves in a place .
And there &apos;s a lot of interesting disclosure rules for everything that &apos;s nuclear in the name .
There &apos;s a lot of interest .
And the people of the company were in Russia , India , China .
I was here and I met the energy minister and talked about how this fits into the energy agenda .
I &apos;m optimistic .
You know , the French and the Japanese have made something in the direction .
This is a variant of one thing .
It was done .
This is an important step forward .
But it &apos;s like a fast reactor .
And some countries have built this .
So anyone who has implemented a fast reactor is a candidate for our first .
CA : In your imagination , timeframe and probability , to really bring this to life .
BG : Well , we need one of these scalable , power generating things that is very cheap .
We &apos;ve got 20 years to invent .
And then 20 years to deploy .
This is kind of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we need to comply with .
And you know , Terrapower ?
If everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish .
Could that keep it easy ?
And fortunately , there are dozens of companies today .
And we need hundreds of them as well .
If their approaches work , the promotion for them .
Pilots can compete for that .
And it would be best if they could do several .
Because then you could use a mix .
In any case , we need a solution .
CA : So , with regard to the big , possible breakthroughs , this is the biggest thing you know .
BG : An energy break is the most important thing .
It would have been without the environmental challenge .
But it makes it even more important in the nuclear sector .
Are there other innovative companies ?
You know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as they do .
But there &apos;s the modular method .
That &apos;s a different approach .
There &apos;s a liquid reactor type that seems a little bit difficult .
But maybe they say that about us .
And so there are different ones .
But the nice thing about this is that a uranium molecule has a million times as much energy .
Like a carbon molecule , let &apos;s say .
And so if you can deal with the problems , you can .
And these are mainly the radiation of the footprint .
And the cost is the potential .
So the impact on the country and other things , almost in a league of its own .
CA : If that doesn &apos;t work , what do we have to do is take emergency measures to try and keep the Earth temperature stable ?
BG : When you get into this situation , it &apos;s as if you ate too much .
And you &apos;re about to have a heart attack .
What do you do ?
You might need a heart surgery or something like that .
There &apos;s a research that &apos;s called geoengineering that &apos;s looking at different techniques to delay warming , so that we could get 20 or 30 years longer to get together .
This is just an insurance method .
You hope we don &apos;t need that .
Some people say you shouldn &apos;t work on insurance at all because you might be lazy , so you eat , because you know that the heart surgery will save you .
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart .
If you look at the importance of this problem .
But there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you should have that at your disposal .
If things get faster or this innovation takes longer than we expect .
CA : Climate skeptics , do you have one or two sentences for those to convince you ?
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
Those who make scientific arguments are very little .
Tell them there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds .
They move things .
There are very , very few things that you can even say , of which there is a chance in a million .
The main problem here is very much like AIDS .
You make the mistake .
Now , and you pay for it much later .
And so the idea now , when you have all kinds of urgent problems , is to invest in something that you only have later , and then the investment is not so clear .
In fact , the IPCC Report is not necessarily the worst scenario .
And there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC and say , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
The fact is that this uncertainty should worry us . &quot;
But my dream here is that if you can make it economically and at the same time eliminate CO2 , then the skeptics also say .
Okay .
I &apos;m not interested in it emitting CO2 .
I almost wish it did .
But I &apos;m probably going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method .
CA : And that would be your answer to that .
Björn Lomborg &apos;s argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve the CO2 problem , you can do it .
All the other goals suffer from it .
Poverty reduction , malaria control , and so on , that it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources to invest money for it , while there are better things we can do .
BG : Well , the actual spending on research , let &apos;s say , the U.S. should .
10 billion a year .
Expenditure more than you do today .
That &apos;s not so dramatic .
It &apos;s not something that should suffer other things .
You get too much money .
And here , reasonable people can disagree .
If you have something that &apos;s not economic and you try to finance it .
For me , most waste is happening here .
Unless you &apos;re very close to a breakthrough in cost and you &apos;re financing it .
Just the learning curve .
I think we should try more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
If the swab you get is a very high energy price , only the rich can keep up .
I mean , each of us here could spend five times as much on our energy without changing our lifestyle .
For the bottom two billion , but is it a disaster ?
And even Lomborg .
Think about his new mesh now , why is research not being discussed anymore ?
He &apos;s still associated with the skeptic camp because of his earlier stories .
But he understood that this is a very lonely group .
And so he &apos;s now bringing the research argument .
And this is a thought that I think is appropriate .
Research , it &apos;s just crazy how little support is given to it .
CA : Bill .
I think I &apos;m speaking for almost .
All the people here .
When I say , &quot; I really hope that your wish will come true . &quot;
Thank you very much .
BG : Thank you .
I &apos;d like to tell you something that I was told a few months ago when I wrote an article for Italian .
Wired noticed , I noticed when I wrote .
I always have my synonymous dictionary ready for use .
But I was already done with editing the text .
And I noticed that I &apos;ve never looked after my life .
What the word &quot; obstructs &quot; really means : I read you the entry &quot; obstructed &quot; .
&quot; Adjective &quot; : Curved .
&quot; Helpless , useless . &quot;
&quot; Destroyed &quot;
&quot; Deathed , mutilated &quot;
&quot; Wounded , &quot; &quot; prepared , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lost , deserved , weakened , impotent , castrated , paralyzed .
Gehandicapt.senil : Age @-@ weak , withdrawn , repaired , done , broken .
Getreibsten , counted @ ( see also : Injured , useless and weak )
Anonyme : Healthy , strong , powerful
I read this list out loud to a friend and I had to laugh first .
It worked so ridiculous .
But I just got ready and couldn &apos;t speak any more and had to stop reading and me .
First of all , collect after this invincible flood of words and the emotional shock that it causes .
Of course , this was a fractured old synonym dictionary .
I just thought the issue has to be pretty old .
But in fact , it was an issue .
In the early 1980s , when I was just beginning primary school .
And so my self @-@ image started building and shaping outside of my family environment .
Also in relation to other children and around me around the world .
And thank God .
I didn &apos;t use a synonymous dictionary at the time .
Would I take this entry seriously ?
Would I have been born into a world that someone like me would perceive as a person whose lives can &apos;t be positive in any way ?
But today I &apos;m celebrated for the opportunities and adventures I &apos;ve experienced .
So I immediately called the 2009 online edition and expected me to find a more appealing contribution here .
Here &apos;s the updated version .
This entry , dummy enough , is not much better .
In particular , the last two words under Near Anonyms shake me completely and healthy .
But it &apos;s not just about the words .
It &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with these words .
It &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values affects our language .
Our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
Many ancient societies , including those of the Greeks and the Romans , really believed that the debate of a curse has a great force , because what you say loud can manifest itself .
So what do we actually want to manifest ?
To call a disabled person or a powerful person , just a person , mindless as a child , could be enough to limit them and give them ideas .
To put them over would not be more beautiful to open doors to them .
A person who opened doors to me was my pediatrician .
AM A.I. DuPont Institute in Wilmington , Delaware .
His name is Dr. Pizzutillo , an Italo @-@ American whose name , you can imagine , is :
Most Americans couldn &apos;t speak correctly .
So he was always called Dr. P.
And Dr. P. always wore very colorful flies and was just created for working with kids .
I found the time I spent in this hospital .
Simply great .
Bending my physiotherapy .
I had to repeat individual exercises seemingly infinitely .
With these thick elastic bands in different colors , you know , to build my leg muscles .
And I hated these bands more than anything else .
I hated them .
I cursed them .
I hated them .
And imagine I even had it as a kid of five .
I negotiated with Dr. P.
And so this is how to stop these exercises .
Natural , without success .
And one day he watched me doing one of my exercises .
These exercises were just tiring and merciless .
And he said to me , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you &apos;re such a strong guy .
Strong and young girl .
You &apos;re going to tear one of these tapes one day .
And if you can do it , I &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
That was , of course , just a simple trick by Dr. P. to do the exercises I didn &apos;t want to do with the prospect of becoming the richest five @-@ year @-@ old girl in the hospital on the second floor .
But he actually got me to see my daily exercise horror with new eyes .
So it became a new and promising experience .
And I wonder today how much his vision of me as strong and powerful .
Young girl shaped my self @-@ image , and I could imagine myself as one of nature &apos;s strong , powerful and atlethic people .
This is just one example .
Of many , how adults in power positions can inspire a child &apos;s imagination .
But as the examples from the synonymous dictionaries already cited prove , our language doesn &apos;t allow us any space to imagine something .
What we all want would allow each and every one of us to see themselves as powerful people .
Our language lags behind the social changes that have , in many cases , been triggered by technological change .
From a medical point of view , of course , one can say that my legs , laser surgery for visually impaired , knee joints made of titanium and artificial hip joints for aging bodies , which allow people to really use all their possibilities and to develop beyond the limits that their natural destiny has set them , not to mention social networking platforms .
People allow themselves to have their own identity , define themselves in their own way , and thus orient themselves globally to groups that they choose .
So perhaps this technological shift makes it clearer than ever that there has always been a different truth , which is that every human being can give something very special and very powerful to society , and that human ability to adapt .
Our greatest plus is human ability to adapt .
This is an interesting story , because people keep asking me to tell me how to deal with adversity .
And I &apos;ll confess something to you : This sentence never fit for me .
And I &apos;ve always been very uncomfortable .
I &apos;ve felt like answering people &apos;s questions .
And I think gradually , I understand why this sentence lives from dealing with adversity .
The idea that success or happiness depends on meeting a challenge without being shaped by the experience that it entails .
As if my life had been so successful , because I could avoid the possible traps of a life with a prosthesis , or whatever people perceive me with my disability .
But the truth is that we are changing .
Of course , we are shaped by the challenge .
Whether it &apos;s physical , emotional or even both .
And I &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
Adversity is not an obstacle that we need to curve to make our lives clearer .
Adversity is just part of our lives .
And I tend to see adversity as my shadow .
Sometimes I realize it &apos;s very present .
Sometimes it &apos;s hard to see .
But it &apos;s always with me .
And I don &apos;t want to .
Reduce the impact or severity of a human fight .
There are adversity and challenges in life .
And they &apos;re all too real .
And each person is different about it .
But the question is not whether we can get clear or not with adversity , but how we get clear about it .
So we &apos;re not just responsible for that .
Preserving the people we love from blows of fate , but also preparing them for it .
All right .
To get clear .
And we &apos;re not doing our kids a favor .
If we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
You have to separate two things clearly .
One is the medical fact that they &apos;re amputee , and the other is the social opinion about it .
Whether I &apos;m disabled or not .
And to be honest , the only real and lasting disability that I had to deal with is that the world is constantly saying .
It can describe me with these definitions .
In our desire to protect the people that care about us and tell them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis , or even a prognosis of the quality of life that they need to expect .
We need to be careful not to lay the foundation for someone actually being disabled .
Maybe the current concept is just about what &apos;s broken .
And how we fix that , for each individual , a greater disability than pathology itself .
If we don &apos;t treat a person holistically and don &apos;t perceive all of his forces and possibilities .
And we recognize , in addition to the natural struggle that you may need to fight .
Another disease .
We degrade a person who has value for our society .
So we need to look beyond patology and focus on all areas of human possibilities .
Most importantly , it &apos;s between perception of our shortcomings and our great inventive spirit .
There &apos;s a connection : We should not devalue or deny these challenging times .
We should not try to avoid them .
We should not sweep them under the carpet , but we should try to identify opportunities in adversity .
I might rather be interested in realizing that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome adversity , but that we are open to embracing it , to embrace it , to use a fight expression , and maybe even dance with it .
And maybe we can see adversity as something natural , coherent and useful , and feel so burdened by its presence .
This year we celebrate Charles Darwin &apos;s 200th birthday .
And when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , Darwin , in my view , pointed out something very true in human character .
I would describe it like this : Not the strongest of its kind survives , nor the smartest of its kind , but the one that can best adapt to change .
Conflict creates creativity , not just from Darwin &apos;s work .
Do we know that human ability to survive and flourish from the struggle of the human mind ?
It &apos;s determined to change through conflict .
So again , change and adaptation are the greatest abilities of man .
And maybe we know only from which wood .
We &apos;re carved when we &apos;re really tested .
Maybe that &apos;s the meaning of adversity .
A sense of ego , a sense of our own power .
We can give ourselves something like that .
We can give adversity a new meaning that goes beyond difficult times .
Maybe we can see adversity as change .
Adversity is a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to yet .
I think the greatest damage we &apos;ve done to ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
Let &apos;s be honest .
Who &apos;s normal ?
There &apos;s no normal .
There &apos;s the usual .
The typical , but not the normal , and would you be this poor , gray person ?
Really want to get to know ?
If there were you .
I don &apos;t think so .
It would be great .
If we were to counter this pattern of normality to another of the possibilities or the strength .
In fact , to put it a little more dangerously , we could exchange it .
So we can unleash the forces of very many children and invite them to bring their very special and valuable skills into society .
Anthropolgen has found that we humans from the members of our society have always demanded one thing : To be useful and to contribute .
There are indications that even the Neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , had worn older people and people with severe physical injuries .
And that might have happened because the life experience in these people &apos;s struggle for survival was valuable to society .
They didn &apos;t break these people .
And they were treated as something special and valuable .
A few years ago , I went to a food market in the city where I grew up .
In that Red Zone in the northeast of Pennsylvania .
And I stood there in front of a cup of tomatoes .
It was summer .
And I had shorts , and I hear a guy say behind me .
Well , if that &apos;s not Aimee Mullins , and I turn around and see this older man .
I had no idea who he is .
And I said , &quot; Excuse me .
Sir , do we know ? &quot;
I can &apos;t remember you .
And he said , &quot; Well , you &apos;re unlikely to remember me . &quot;
When I first saw you , I took you out of your mother &apos;s belly .
&quot; Oh .
So , the ? &quot;
And of course , it did , but click .
That was Dr.
Kean .
A man I only knew from my mother &apos;s stories about this day , because of course , I came two weeks late on my birthday , typical of it .
The doctor for prenatal diagnostics of my mother was on vacation .
And so my parents didn &apos;t know the man who gave me birth at all .
And because I was born without a calf &apos;s legs .
And my feet had turned towards them , and I just had a few toes on this one and a few toes .
On the other foot , he was the handler .
This stranger had to bring the bad news .
He said to me , &quot; I had to tell your parents that you would never walk and never move like that .
You would be like other kids , or you could never live an independent life .
And since then , they &apos;ve just lied to me .
Really punished .
Exceptionally , I found that he collected newspaper clips of my entire childhood .
Whether I won a letter contest in second grade , whether I was on the Halloween parade with the scouts .
Whether I had won my scholarship or one of my sporting victories .
And he used these clips to teach his students .
Medical students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School .
And he called this part of his course the X factor , the potential of human will .
You just can &apos;t stress enough how critical this factor can be for a human being &apos;s quality of life .
And Dr. Kean continued .
He said , &quot; I learned that if you don &apos;t get something else constantly , children will be told .
And even if you get a little bit of support , if you leave kids to themselves .
Then children can achieve a lot .
Look at Dr.
Kean has changed his thinking .
He understood that the medical diagnosis and how someone deals with it are two different things .
And I too have my thinking .
Over time , I have changed .
If you asked me at the age of 15 , would I have changed my prostheses against legs made of meat and bones ?
Then I would not have hesitated for a second .
I absolutely wanted to be normal at the time .
If you ask me that today , I &apos;m not so sure .
And that &apos;s what happened because I &apos;ve experienced something with my legs .
And not despite these experiences .
And maybe that change could happen because I &apos;ve met so many people who opened doors to me instead of meeting people who wanted to restrict me or overtake me with an idea .
See ?
It really only takes a person to demonstrate to you how to manifest their forces .
And they &apos;re through .
If you allow someone to activate their own inner forces .
The human mind is so receptive .
If you do that and open a door for someone at a critical moment .
Then you &apos;re for those people .
Very good teachers .
You teach them to open doors to themselves , the real meaning of the word .
Educate is rooted in the word educe .
It means to create something that is in one : Tickle out the potential , again , what potential do we want to retrieve ?
In the 1960s , a case study was conducted in the U.K.
Back then , high schools were transformed into secondary schools .
They call that streaming trials .
In the U.S. , we call that tracking .
Students are divided into grades .
And the A students get more orally tested , the better teachers , etc . , and they then gave students with a grade that was very good enough over a three @-@ month period .
They were told .
They were aces that they were very smart .
And after those three months , they really wrote one .
And of course , it breaks down your heart to hear that the other way around , the one @-@ serer students were told .
They were just enough .
And it was the same .
After the three months , but only those who were still in school .
Quite crucial , apart from the students who had thrown the school .
In this study , the teachers were not inaugurated .
The teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
They were simply told that the Einser students were , and that the students with the grade are sufficient .
And they were taught something like that .
And she treats the only real disability is a broken mind .
A spirit that was broken has no hope anymore .
It finds nothing more .
Beautiful .
It lacks .
Our natural childish curiosity .
And our innate ability to imagination , but if we can help the human mind to continue to hope to find themselves and other people around it beautiful .
Being curious and imaginative , then we really use our forces positively .
If a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new forms of existence .
I want to end with a poem written by a Persian poet named Hafiz in the 14th century .
And the poem that my friend Jacques Dembois told me about , and the poem is called &quot; The God Who Knows Only Four Words . &quot;
Every child doesn &apos;t know God , the God of the name , not the God of prohibitions , but the God who knows only four words .
And this is repeated all the time .
He only always says , &quot; Come dance with me . &quot;
&quot; Come dance with me . Thank you very much . &quot;
