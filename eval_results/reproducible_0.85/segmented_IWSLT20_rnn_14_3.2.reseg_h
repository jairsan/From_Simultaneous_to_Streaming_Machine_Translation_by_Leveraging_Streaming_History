A few years ago here at TED , Peter Skillman launched a design competition called &quot; The Marshmallow Challenge . 
&quot; The idea is pretty simple . Four teams have to have the widest possible freestanding structure with 20 spaghetti . CA : 1m tape . CA : 1m thread and build a marshmallow , 
the marshmallow has to be up on top . 
And though it &apos;s really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard . Because it &apos;s pushing people to work together very quickly . 
And so I thought this was a really interesting idea . And I did it into a design workshop . 
It was a huge success . 
Since then , I &apos;ve had about 70 workshops around the world . I &apos;ve been doing with students , developers and architects , even CTOs , Fortune 50 companies . And there &apos;s something about this task . What deep impressions of nature are about the way we work together . And I want to share some of these with you . 
Normally , most people start themselves , with regard to the task of orienting themselves . 
They talk about it . They think about what it &apos;s going to look like . They &apos;re rangling for power . 
Then they invest a little time in planning and organization . They sketch and put spaghetti out . 
They invest a lot of their time in assembling . Constantly growing structures . 
And finally . Shortly before they don &apos;t have time anymore , someone takes the Marshmallow . And they put it gently on the top , step . One step back and admire TA @-@ DA . 
But what happens then almost always is that this TA @-@ DA becomes an UH @-@ Oh , because the weight of the Marshmallow causes the whole thing to bend and bend and collapse . 
There &apos;s a series of people who have a lot more UH @-@ Oh moments than others . And among the worst are freshest BWL graduates . 
They lie , they cheat . They &apos;re confused and they produce really poor shapes . 
And of course , there are also teams that have a lot more TA @-@ DA formations . And among the best are freshness graduates of the kindergarten . 
And that &apos;s quite amazing , like us . 
Peter told us , &quot; Don &apos;t just produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all . 
&quot; What you might ask is , how does this come about ? Why ? What about those ? 
And Peter doesn &apos;t tell one . The kids spend time in this . Chef of Spaghetti GmbH to be . They 
don &apos;t spend time in power struggles . 
There &apos;s still one more reason , however , 
and that is that BWL students were trained to do a real plan . OK . 
And then to realize what 
then happens , when they do the Marshmallow on the top , they put it on the top . They don &apos;t have time anymore . And what happens ? 
It &apos;s a crisis . 
Sounds familiar . What ? What do 
kindergarten kids do differently is they do it with the Marshmallow and build prototypes . Successful prototypes , always with the Marshmallow at the top so that they can repeatedly have the opportunity to build dilapidated prototypes to repair . 
Constructors recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of an iterative process . 
And with every attempt , the kids get immediate feedback , what works . And what doesn &apos;t work like 
that is prototyping performance . But essentially , let &apos;s see how different teams operate : 
The average for most is the same . At about 50 centimeters of BWL students , half of them lawyers do something more , but not much . Kindergarten kids are better than adults . 
Who is most successful architect 
and engineer ? Fortunately . 
1M : Is the highest . What I &apos;ve seen 
and why ? Because they understand triangles and self @-@ reinforcing geometric patterns . The key to stable structures to 
build CEOs are something about something above average . But here it gets interesting . 
If you put an executive administrator . On the team , they get significantly better . 
It &apos;s incredible . You can see around and see . This team will win . You 
can predict that . Why is that ? 
Because you have special process monitoring skills . 
You run the process . You understand it 
and that team that governs and governs and focuses on work . It pays attention to the team &apos;s performance will significantly improve . 
Specialized skills and process skills and their combination will lead to success . 
If you have 10 teams that are typical of what you do , you get . CA : 6 : Stable structures , 
I tried something exciting now . 
I thought , let &apos;s get the poker bet right away . 
So I offered a $ 10,000 prize of software for the winners . 
What do you think happened ? With these design students . 
What was that ? 
Result . This happened . No team had a stable structure . 
If anyone had a two @-@ inch construction built , he would have won the prize home . 
The price is not interesting , therefore , that high betting bets have a strong effect . 
We repeated this exercise with the same students . 
What do you think happened ? 
Well , you understood the advantage of prototyping . 
So this became the same bad team , one of the best . 
They made the highest construction in the least time . 
There are , therefore , profound lessons for us about the nature of propulsion and success . 
You may ask questions . Why would someone actually invest time ? A Marshmallow challenge to 
create . The reason is , I help create digital tools and processes to create teams to help . Cars , video games and visual effects to create . 
And what the Marshmallow Challenge does is it helps you create hidden assumptions , and it helps you identify them . 
Because frankly , every project has its own Marshmallow . The challenge is to 
have a shared experience . A common language or basic attitude , the right prototype to 
build . And this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise . 
And those of you who are interested can take MarshmallowChallenge . COM : 
It &apos;s a blog where you can see how to make the Marshmallows . 
There &apos;s a step @-@ by @-@ step guide there . 
You &apos;ll find crazy examples from all over the world , like people . The system optimizes and refines . 
There &apos;s also world records . 
And the basal lesson , I think , is the construction , actually , a connecting sport . Is 
it required that we all make our senses fit for the task and that we make our thinking optimal use of how our feelings and our emotions and our actions are challenged by the challenges ahead of us ? 
And sometimes , a small prototype of this experience is . Everything it takes us from a single uh @-@ oh to a ta @-@ da moment . 
And that can make a big difference . 
Thank you very much . 
Let &apos;s pretend we have here as if we have a machine . 
A big machine . A cool , TED @-@ like machine . And that &apos;s a time machine . 
And everybody in this room has to enter . 
And you can enter the past . You can enter the future . You can &apos;t go into the here . 
And now stay . And I wonder what you choose . Because you would choose , because I &apos;ve been telling my friends a lot recently . This question was asked , and they all wanted to go into the past . 
I don &apos;t know . They wanted to go back to time before cars were there or Twitter or America is looking for the superstar . 
I don &apos;t know . 
I &apos;m convinced that somehow you &apos;re going to be drawn to nostalgia , to wishful thinking . 
And that &apos;s what I understand . 
I &apos;m not part of it . This group , I have to say , 
I don &apos;t want to go back to the past , and that &apos;s not because I &apos;m an adventurer . 
It &apos;s because opportunities on this table are not back on the planet . They &apos;re going forward . 
I want to go into this machine . And I want to go into the future . 
This is the greatest time it &apos;s ever been on this planet . No matter what scale you &apos;re applying . Health , wealth . Mobility , opportunities , falling rates of disease . 
There has never been a time like this before . 
My great grandparents all died when they were 60 . 
My grandparents urged this number to 70 . 
My parents are 80 , 80 , on their heels . 
There should be better a nine . At the beginning of my death . 
But it &apos;s not even about people like us . Because this is a bigger thing than that , 
a child who &apos;s in New Delhi today , can expect to be born for so long as he &apos;s the richest man on earth . 100 years ago , you 
think about it . This is an incredible fact . 
And why is this ? 
Smallpox , smallpox , it &apos;s got billions of people killed on this planet . 
They &apos;ve got the demographics of the Earth in a way that they &apos;ve not redesigned war . Ever managed to do 
it . They &apos;re gone . They &apos;ve disappeared . 
We &apos;ve defeated them . Puff 
in the rich world : There are diseases that millions of us have in the rich world that threatened just a generation ago . Hardly any diphtheria is rubbing . 
Polio knows anything . Someone else 
knows what that is . Vaccines 
, modern medicine . Our ability to reach out to billions of people . These are successes of the scientific method . 
And from my point of view , the scientific method is to try things out . Look , whether it works . It changes . If it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity . 
This is , therefore , the good news . 
Unfortunately , this is already the whole good news . Because there is a few other problems . And they &apos;ve been mentioned many times , 
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people in the world are hungry to go to bed every day . 
This number is rising , and it &apos;s rising very quickly . And that &apos;s embarrassing . 
And not only that . We have our imagination used to use this world to 
thoroughly devastate , drinking water . Urbare land , rainforests , oil . Gas . They disappear . And soon . And if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos , we also disappear . 
The question is , can we do that ? I think so . 
I think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food . The billions of people who feed without the land on which they live , without rape . 
I think we can make this world energy @-@ powered , that they don &apos;t destroy at the same time . 
I think that &apos;s really what it is . And no . That &apos;s not wishful thinking . 
But this is holding me awake at night . One of the things that awakes me at night . We have scientific progress never before , so much needed as we have never before . 
And we &apos;ve also never been to the point where we could use it sensibly , as we do today . 
We &apos;re at the threshold of amazing , amazing events on many fronts . And yet I really think we really have hundreds of 300 years before the Enlightenment , back to be able to go back to find a time when we &apos;re fighting progress . In which we talk about these things more vigorously , more about fronts than we do now . 
People cover themselves in their faith in it . And that &apos;s so tight that they &apos;re not free . 
Not even the truth will liberate them . 
And listen . Everybody has a right to their opinion , even a right to their opinion , on progress . 
But you know what they &apos;re not entitled to ? 
They &apos;re not entitled to their own . Facts , charges , they &apos;re not . 
And I have a while to get that out of the way , 
about a decade ago , I published an article about immunization for The New Yorker , a little article . 
And I was amazed at resistance to meet . Resistance to resistance to what ended up being the most effective measure in healthcare in history , in the history of humanity . 
I didn &apos;t know what to do . So I just did what I always do . I wrote an article and I went on . 
And soon thereafter , I wrote an article about genetically modified . Foodstuffs : The 
same thing , just bigger . 
People played crazy . 
So I also have a paper about it . And I couldn &apos;t understand why the people thought . That would be Frankenfood , why ? They believed molecules were on a certain molecule , rather than a random way of moving around , an attack on the territory of nature . 
But you know , I do what I do . I wrote the article . I kept going . 
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist . 
We type , we type , we reach . We go eat . That &apos;s okay . 
But these articles made me worry . And I couldn &apos;t figure out why . And eventually , I found out . 
And that &apos;s because these fanatics are the fanatics who made me crazy at all , not fanatics at all . 
These were prudent people . Educated people , decent people . 
They were just like people in the same room . 
And that brought me so much confusion . 
But then I thought , &quot; You know what ? Let &apos;s be honest . 
We &apos;re on one point , at which we &apos;re not at the same relationship to progress , as we were at the time . 
We &apos;re talking about it in two ways . 
We &apos;re talking about it ironically . We &apos;re talking about it with small quotes , about progress . Okay 
. There &apos;s a reason for that . And I think we know what reasons that is . 
We have confidence in institutions , in authority and sometimes in institutions , in science itself , in itself . And there &apos;s no reason why that &apos;s not so . 
You can just do some names . And people will understand 
Chernobyl , Bhopal , Challenger , Vioxx , weapons of mass destruction , the 2000 US presidential election . I mean , 
you know , you can have your own list . 
There are questions and problems with the people of whom we are believed to be always you &apos;re right . Be , therefore , skeptical . 
Imagine questions , ask evidence . Ask evidence . 
Ask evidence . Take nothing but given . 
But now it &apos;s when you get evidence , you have to accept that evidence . And in that , we &apos;re not good at . And I 
can do that for the reason that we &apos;re now in a epidemic of epidemic of fear , as I do , as I &apos;ve never seen before . And hopefully never again , I &apos;ll see 
about 12 years ago , a story was published . A terrible story that the Autism epidemic had with the measles , mumps and rubells , vaccine , linked . 
Very scary , 
shocking , in a way . Studies were done to see if there was a true , 
shoddy story . Studies were to be done . This is a serious issue . 
The data came in . 
The data came in from the United States . England , Sweden , Canada . And they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection . 
It doesn &apos;t make any difference . It doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes . We believe what we see , what we see , what we believe to see , what causes us to feel real . 
We don &apos;t believe in a bundle of documents from a government clerk who gives us data . And I understand that . I think that &apos;s what we all do . 
But you know what ? 
The result of that was catastrophic , catastrophic . 
Because of this fact , the United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is falling . 
That &apos;s scandalous . And we should be ashamed . 
It &apos;s terrible . 
What happened is that we do that , we could . Well 
, I understand that . That &apos;s what I do . Because here 
&apos;s somebody here who has measles ? 
Has a single one in the audience ? Anyone in the audience who sees someone die of measles 
doesn &apos;t happen very often . That &apos;s where it 
doesn &apos;t happen at all in this country . But 160,000 times on the planet . Last year . 
That &apos;s a lot of measles &apos; deaths : 20 per hour . 
But because that &apos;s not what happened here , we can displace it . And people like Jenny McCarthy can walk around and messages of fear and illiteracy , platforms , like Oprah . And Larry King preach live . And 
that &apos;s what they can do because they cause and correlation not connect . 
They don &apos;t understand that these things are the same . But almost never the same . 
And that &apos;s something we learn . And that &apos;s very fast . 
This guy was a hero . Jonas Salk . 
He liberated us from one of the worst scourges of humanity , not fear , 
not pain , polio . Puff disappeared , the 
guy in the middle , not so much . 
His name is Paul Offit . 
He &apos;s just got a few other people with a Rotavirus vaccine . 
He can live the lives of 400 , 500,000 children a year . In the developing world , it &apos;s 
pretty good to save . Not , 
well , that &apos;s good . Apart from Paul walking around and talking about vaccines and saying , &quot; How valuable they are and that the people are just going to stop thinking about complaining . 
&quot; And that &apos;s what he actually says . 
Paul is a terrorist . 
So if Paul is in a public hearing , he can &apos;t speak without armed guards . 
He gets calls at home because the people tell him like to tell him they know where his children are going to school . 
And why ? Because Paul has made a vaccine . 
I need not say that . But vaccines are essential . 
Take them away . Turn the diseases back . Terrible diseases . And that &apos;s what &apos;s happening right now . 
We have in this country now measles . 
And that &apos;s getting worse . And pretty soon , kids will get to die of it again . Because that &apos;s just a question of numbers . 
And they won &apos;t just be on measles . 
What about polio ? Let &apos;s take that . Why not ? 
A fellow militant of mine told me a few weeks ago , and said , &quot; She believes I &apos;m a little bit too shrill . 
Nobody has ever had said that before . 
She would have no child against polio . No one , 
fine . 
Why ? Because we don &apos;t have polio . And you know what ? 
We had in this country yesterday no polio . 
Today , I don &apos;t know . Maybe today morning rose . Someone in Lagos went on an airplane and is flying to Los Angeles . Right now , he &apos;s over Ohio 
and into a few hours , he lands . And he rents a car . And he comes to Long Beach . And he becomes one of these fantastic TED dinner . This evening , he goes to visit , 
and he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s infected with a paralyzing disease . And we know that , either . Because that &apos;s how the world works . Well , 
that &apos;s the planet on which we live . Do not do it as if it 
&apos;s not . We love it in lies . We love to cover it up . 
We love that . Do you have everybody this morning ? Your vitamins : 
Echinacea . A little antioxidant that will put you on the leaps . 
I know you &apos;re doing that . Because the half of the Americans , that every day , do it . 
They take the stuff . And they take alternative remedies . And it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re useless . 
The data shows this all the time . 
They evaporate their urine more . Do almost never . 
This is okay . You like 28 billion dollars for the dark . Pay urine . 
I agree with you completely . 
Darker . Urine dark . 
Why do we do this ? Why do we do this ? 
Well , I think I understand . We hate the pharmaceutical industry . 
We hate one too strong government . We don &apos;t have confidence in the system . 
And that &apos;s what we shouldn &apos;t . Our healthcare system is bad . 
It &apos;s cruel to millions of people . 
It &apos;s absolutely amazingly cold and soul @-@ reeling , even to us , who can afford it . 
We &apos;re running away from it and where are we going ? 
We &apos;re walking into the arms of the placebo industry . 
That &apos;s great . I love the placebo industry . 
But you know , that &apos;s really a serious business . Because the stuff is crap . And we &apos;re giving billions of dollars for it . 
And I &apos;ve got all sorts of little props here , 
none of them : Gingko fraud , Echinacea fraud , Acai . And I don &apos;t even know what that is . But we &apos;re giving billions of dollars for it . It &apos;s cheating . 
And you know what ? If I say that , I &apos;m being screamed at by people and they say , &quot; What cares you ? &quot; &quot; Let people do what they do , anyway . 
&quot; So they feel good . And 
you know what ? They &apos;re wrong 
because it doesn &apos;t matter to me whether it &apos;s the Health Minister . He says , &quot; Hmm . &quot; I &apos;m going to get the evidence from my experts on mammography , or any cancer quack ointment that &apos;s treating his patients with coffee intakes . 
If you look at this path , where do you think and magic , evidence and science replace , you get to a place where you can &apos;t be , you don &apos;t want to be . 
You get to Thabo Mbeki in South Africa . 
He brought 400,000 of his people around because he was insisting on insisting that red beds , garlic and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs , of which we know they &apos;re going to be the ones that can slow down the course of AIDS . 
Hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country worse than any other of these diseases plagued by it . 
Tell me , please do not tell me that these things have no consequences . They have them 
, they always have them . 
Well , the most unwieldy epidemic we have just been to is this absurd fight between the two proponents of genetically modified food . And the bio @-@ elite . 
That &apos;s an idiotic debate . It has to stop . 
It &apos;s a debate about words about metaphors . 
That &apos;s ideology , not science . 
Everything we eat , every grain of rice . Every branch of parsley . Every sprouts has been made by people . 
You know , there were no mandarin in paradise . 
There were no cantaloupe melons . There were no Christmas trees . We have all done this . 
We have it in the last 11 000 years . 
And some of it worked and some of it didn &apos;t . 
We got rid of what didn &apos;t work . 
Now we can do it more precisely . And of course , there are risks . But we can do something like vitamin A in rice . And the stuff can get millions of people to help millions of people prolong their lives . 
That &apos;s not what they want to do . 
I have to say , I don &apos;t understand . 
We reject genetically modified food . 
Why do we do that ? 
Well , what I hear all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture . We don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing . That &apos;s wrong . 
We don &apos;t want companies to patent lives . 
We don &apos;t want companies to own seeds . 
And you know what ? My answer to all of this is 
yes . You &apos;re right . Let &apos;s fix that . 
It &apos;s true . We have a huge food problem . But that &apos;s not science . 
That &apos;s science . 
It &apos;s not science . It &apos;s morality . Patent stuff . 
You know that science is not a company . 
It &apos;s not a country . 
It &apos;s not even an idea . It &apos;s a process . 
It &apos;s a process . And sometimes it works . And sometimes it doesn &apos;t . But the idea that we can give science no permission to do their work . Because we &apos;re afraid , it &apos;s a real impasse . And it keeps millions of people from flourishing . 
AB : You know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to grow 70 percent more food . When we &apos;re 70 percent of 
this investment in Africa right now in the last 30 years , 
shameful , shameful . 
You need that . And we &apos;re giving it to you . 
And why genetically modified food ? 
We want people not to encourage this rotten stuff to eat , like , Maniok . 
Maniok is something that &apos;s half a billion . People eat . 
It &apos;s about like a potato . 
It &apos;s just a bunch of calories . It &apos;s bad . 
It doesn &apos;t have nutrients . It doesn &apos;t have protein . And scientists are building all this right in there . 
And then the people could eat the food and wouldn &apos;t be blinded . 
They wouldn &apos;t starve . And you know what ? 
That would be nice . It wouldn &apos;t be Chez Panisse . But it would be nice . 
And everything I did to say about this is , why do we fight this ? 
I mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why do we fight this ? 
Because we don &apos;t want to push genes around . 
It &apos;s not about pushing genes around . It &apos;s not about chemicals . 
It &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones . Our insistence on greater food , better food , unique food . 
It &apos;s not about rice krispies . It &apos;s about people living . It &apos;s about keeping people alive . And it &apos;s high time to understand what this means . 
Because , you know what ? 
If we don &apos;t do that , if we keep on going as we do . Let &apos;s get to blame for something that we believe we owe , I don &apos;t want to be guilty of . High @-@ tech colonialism . 
There &apos;s no other description for that that that &apos;s happening here . 
It &apos;s selfish . It &apos;s ugly . It &apos;s not worthy of us . And we have to really stop that . 
After this incredibly fun conversation , you want to say , maybe you always want to be in . This ridiculous time machine and the future are going 
to go , anyway . That &apos;s what I want anyway . Right now , 
it &apos;s in the present . But we have an incredible opportunity . 
We can have this time machine put on everything we want . 
We can move it where we can move it . And we will get it to where we want it to be . 
We need to have these conversations . And we need to think . But if we go into the time machine and into the future , we will be happy to see that we &apos;ve done that . 
I know we &apos;re able to do it . And as far as I &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something that the world needs now . 
Thank you . 
Thank you . When Steve Lopez , a columnist of the Los Angeles Times , One day through the streets in the center of Los Angeles , one day he heard a wonderful music . 
She came from a man , an African @-@ American , sympathetic , rough , homeless , who was playing on a violin that had only two strings left . 
Many of you will hear the story . Because from Steve &apos;s article about this , a book later became filmed , with Robert Robert`s Downey Junior . When Steve Lopez and Jamie Foxx were Nathaniel Anthony Ayers , who was the contrabass player at the Juilliard Conservatory , and whose promising career tragically early on was paranoid schizophrenia , when he was finished . 
Nathaniel left Juilliard , suffered a nervous breakdown , and 30 years later he lived as homeless on the streets of Skid Row in the center of Los Angeles . 
I recommend to all of you that you read Steves &apos; book , or watch the movie so that you can not only understand the wonderful interconnectedness that exists between these two men , but also how the music , this connection , helped to make . And how they eventually made the instrument when this play of words is allowed . That &apos;s why Nathaniel , half a mile away from the street , got away . 
I met Mr. Ayers . In 2008 , two years ago , two years ago , at the Walt Disney Concert Hall . 
He just had a demonstration of Beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and he came behind the stage to get himself behind the stage to imagine me . 
He spoke in a very cheerful and sociable tone about yo @-@ yo . MA : And Hillary Clinton and about how the Dodgers never heard it into baseball world , and how the Dodgers would make it into baseball world series . And all of this because of the insidious passage of the first violin in the last sentence of Beethoven . Fourth Symphony : 
We came up with the theme of &quot; Speaking music &quot; and a few days later , I got an email saying that Nathaniel was in favor of violin lessons with me . 
I still have to mention that Nathaniel is a person who refused medical treatment , because he was already with electric shocks . And with Thorazin and handcuffs , he was treated with trauma , which his entire life . 
Had him persecuted as a result of that , he &apos;s now particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases . They &apos;re sometimes so bad that they can make him tear him apart . And he disappears for days in the streets of Skid Row wandering around . Always , this horror and the torture torment of his own mind is exposed . 
And in exactly one stage of excitement , Nathaniel was when we were at our first lesson in the Walt Disney , Concert Hall , where we started . He had this crazy flickering in his eyes and he was working completely lost . 
He talked about invisible demons and smoke and about how he was being told in sleep how someone wanted to poison him . 
I was afraid , not for me , but for fear that I was going to lose him , that he was going to sink into one of his states , and that I was going to destroy his relationship with the violin . If I started talking about clay ladders and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy , 
I would like to say that . I would just start talking to you . 
I would play the first sentence of Beethoven &apos;s violin concerto . 
And while I was playing , I noticed that in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes , a complete change is taking place . 
It was as if he was going to be under the influence of an invisible doctor . A chemical reaction , the catalyst of which was my game , 
turned Nathaniel &apos;s maniac anger into understanding , into a calm curiosity and grace . 
And as if by a miracle , he took his violin and began to listen . Some excerpts of violin concerts to play and asked me to play them to the end , then . Mendelssohn Chaikovsky , Sibelius . 
We then started talking about music . From Bach to Beethoven , Brahms , Bruckner and all the others BS of Bartók to Beethoven , Brahms , Bruckner and all the other BS from Esa @-@ Pekka Salonen . 
And I realized that he didn &apos;t just have an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but also connected him to it with a close personal relationship . 
He talked about her with a passion and a sense that she had , which I usually only talked about from my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic , 
by making music , playing music and talking about music . And from this paranoid , confused man who was just walking through the streets of Los Angeles , a kind of adorable , educated , excellent Juilliard musician , who had just been trained . 
Music is medicine . Music changes us 
for Nathaniel . Does music mean mental health 
? Because music allows it to give it its thoughts and delusions with the help of its imagination and creativity into something real . 
And so he escapes his tormenting state . 
I understood that this is the very nature of art . 
Exactly . This is why this is why we make music so that we can do something that is deep inside of us all . Our feelings through our artistic lens , through our creativity , towards reality , can shape . 
And reality of that expression reaches us all , and moves , inspires and unites us . 
What Nathaniel was doing , the Nathaniel brought him back to a community of friends who 
were redeeming power of music , bringing him back to the community of friends , bringing him back to a family of musicians . They understood him who had recognized his talent and respected him . 
And I &apos;m going to talk to Nathaniel again and again . Whether in the Walt Disney Concert , Hall or in Skid , Row , because he reminds me of why I was a musician , he reminds me . 
Thank you very much . 
Bruno Giussani : Thank you . Thank you . 
Robert Gupta , 
Robert Gupta . I want to play something that I shamefully love stolen the cellist . 
I hope you will forgive me . 
I &apos;m Jane McGonigal . I design computer games . 
I &apos;m now developing for 10 years online games . And my goal for the next decade is to do just as easily as that . The world where reality is saving the world as it does in online games is 
saving . I have a plan for that . I want more people to convince , including all of you , more time playing with bigger and more amazing games , too . 
Right now , we spend three billion hours a week playing online . 
Some of you may think so . This is a lot of time for games . 
Maybe something too much time . If you think about how many problems we urgently have in real life , how many problems we have to solve . In 
fact , but my research at the Institute for the Future , according to me , is exactly the opposite . 
Right ? Three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to make the most pressing problems in the world . 
Indeed , I am convinced that if we are to move to this planet for the next century , we will dramatically increase this time . 
I calculated that the time needed to do that is 21 billion hours of playing time . Per week 
, that &apos;s what it looks like . First , maybe a little bit absurd . So I repeat it with that . It can work if we can have problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , and I think we need to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week by the end of the next decade . 
No . I mean , it &apos;s really serious . 
Why ? This 
picture describes quite precisely why . I think games like this are so vital to the survival of the human species in the future . Serious . 
This is a portrait of the photographer . Phil Toledano . 
He wanted to share the feelings of playing . So he &apos;s in front of the players , he &apos;s built a camera . 
This is one of the classic expressions . 
When playing , if you &apos;re not a player , you may miss them . Some of the nuances in this picture . 
You probably see this sense of urgency , some fear , but also extreme concentration , deeply deepened into solving a problem of real difficulty . 
If you play , you &apos;ll see some nuances . Here &apos;s the upward @-@ drawn eyes . And the mouth is a sign of optimism . The eyebrows show surprise . 
This is a player who &apos;s on the edge of what &apos;s called an epic victory . 
Oh , you know that . 
OK . Great . So we have some players here , 
an epic . Victory is a result that &apos;s so very positive that it &apos;s so positive that you didn &apos;t even know before that it was possible at all . 
It was almost beyond imagination . And if you can do it , you &apos;re shocked that you actually have to be able to do 
that . That &apos;s an epical victory . 
This player is about to be an epic victory . 
And this is what we &apos;re going to see on millions of faces of problem solvers around the world . If we can overcome the hurdles of the next century , the face of those who face the odds of all odds on the edge of an epic victory . 
Well , unfortunately , we see this face more in real life . If we face difficult problems , I call 
it the one in life , I call it . I mean , bad face , and it &apos;s 
actually my face . Look , yeah . OK . That &apos;s me . How I 
do that in life ? I &apos;m bad . Face making . 
This is a graffiti in my former home country in Berkeley . California , where I did my Ph.D. study on why we play better , than we do in real life . 
This is a problem . This is a problem that many players have . 
We think that in reality , we &apos;re not as good as playing . And 
I don &apos;t mean just less successful , although that &apos;s part of it . 
We &apos;re reaching more in play worlds . 
I mean , good in connection with motivation , something important about doing . Inspired in collaboration with each other . 
If we &apos;re in a game world , I think many of us are in our game world , turning into our best version , always and immediately ready to help , persistent . The problem of trying to solve as long as necessary , after the failure , try again . 
And in reality , if we fail , if we fail , if we encounter obstacles , we often feel different . 
We feel overwhelmed . We feel defeated . We feel threatened . Maybe depressed , frustrated or cynical . These feelings 
we never have . If we play games in games , there are them simply not . 
And that &apos;s what I call &quot; Ph.D. student &quot; wanted to study . 
Why is it in games impossible to think ? You couldn &apos;t just achieve everything . 
How can we make those feelings out of the games come to reality ? 
So I looked at games like World of Warcraft . It &apos;s the ideal environment for playing together to solve problems . 
And I have a few things to say . The epic victories in online worlds as possible . 
So first , if you go into one of these online games , especially World of Warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters ready to play with you a world saving mission . And that &apos;s immediate . 
But not just any mission , but a mission that &apos;s perfect for your current level . In the game , it fits 
right . So you can do that . 
You never get a task that you don &apos;t solve . 
But always on the edge of your skills , so you have to make an effort . 
But there &apos;s no unemployment in the World of Warcraft . You don &apos;t sit around and turn around demons . There &apos;s always a very specific , important thing to do . And 
there &apos;s a lot of staff wherever 
you go . Hundreds of thousands of people working with them to get their epic mission done . 
That &apos;s what we have in real life , not that easy . That sense of feeling that when you have fingerprints , you have people who are willing to do it in ways , 
and there &apos;s this epic story . This inspiring story , why we &apos;re there . And what we do is then what we get this whole thing positive feedback . 
You &apos;ve probably got from level up and 1 strength , or 1 intelligence . 
This constant feedback is not there in the real world . 
If I &apos;m leaving this stage , I don &apos;t have 1 speech and 1 crazy idea . 20 crazy idea . 
I get in real life . 
This feedback , not . So the problem of collaborative online worlds like World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying . Anytime on the edge of an epic victory , that we prefer to stand on the edge of these games all the time . 
They &apos;re just better than reality . 
So far , all of the World of Warcraft players have come together . 5.93 million years to spend the world of warcraft virtual problems of Azerbaijan solving . 
This is not necessarily a bad thing . 
It may sound bad . 
But to put it in context , I think , 5.93 , million years ago , started . Our first primate ancestors started walking upright . 
The first upright primacy . 
So OK . So if we talk about how much time we currently spend with games , right ? Does that make sense ? When do you spend time with regard to time on the scale of human development , in mind ? What &apos;s extraordinary , 
but also appropriate ? Because it turns out that we have to do this by doing this all the time playing games , actually changing it . What we as humans do as human beings ? 
We develop into a community . Thinking , heartfelt beings . 
That &apos;s the truth . That &apos;s what I believe in . 
Look at this interesting statistic , which is recently published by a researcher of Carnegie Mellon University , published . The average young person today in the middle of a country with a strong playing culture spends . 10,000 hours with online games , up to the age of 21 . 
So 10,000 . Hours is an extremely interesting number . From two reasons : 
First , for children in the United States , 10 080 hours , the exact total time they spend in school , from the five @-@ grade to the end of the high school . If you never miss it , 
so here we have a complete parallel education path . On the young people learn the same thing that it means . A good player to be like everything else , whatever you &apos;re doing in school . And maybe 
some of you have that new book from Malcolm , Gladwell . Overflying , so you know his theory of success . The theory of success of 10,000 dollars of success . 
It &apos;s based on great research , cognitive science , that if we read 10,000 hours with the laborious study of a given subject , up to the age of 21 , we will master . In that , 
we will do so well in it . Whatever it may be to do , like the most important people in the world . 
So what we have here is a complete generation of young people , the master players . 
The big question is , what ? Exactly , are players masterfully good ? Because 
if we figure out that out , we would never have been able to have any human potential that we could have 
known before . So many people do we have in the world right now , who have at least an hour a day playing online ? These 
are our master players . 500 million people , who are exceptionally good at something . 
And the next decade , we have another billion players , the extraordinary good at what &apos;s also happening , in whatever . 
If you still haven &apos;t heard it , 
the game industry has developed consoles . The energy saving and on mobile networks working instead of broadband Internet . So that players around the world are especially in India . China , Brazil , playing online , 
you can expect an additional billion players . Next decade . 
So we &apos;ve got a total of 1.5 billion players . 
So I started to think about what it is , what it is , what we can do with these games . 
Here are the four things I do that I found . First , urgency optimism . 
OK . Imagine how extreme self @-@ motivation . 
Urgency optimism is desire . Right away , to do something . A hurdle to overcome , along with faith that we have a well @-@ founded hope of success . 
Players always believe that a epic epic victory is possible , and that it is always possible and worthwhile to try and try , and that is , 
equal players don &apos;t sit around . 
Players are masters . Spiders , poets , social networks . 
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research . These show that we people like more . After we have played with them , even if they &apos;re evil at us . 
The reason for this is that it &apos;s a lot of trust that requires you to play a game with someone . 
We trust that somebody will have time to spend with us , that the rules will be respected . That we will achieve the same goal , and that we will stay with them until the end of the 
game . So that allows for interaction . Growing the bonds , trust and interconnectedness as a result . 
And we build stronger social relationships of that , happy 
productivity . Fantastic . 
You know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of warcraft player is 22 hours a week . So as part @-@ time job . 
The reason is that if we play , we &apos;re actually happier at it , working hard . As if we relax or nothing , or we do nothing , 
we know that we as human beings function optimally . If we do hard , significant work 
and players are always ready , hard to work . If they do the right job and 
eventually get epic meaning , 
players love it , part of awe more powerful . Missions of planetary proportions . 
Here &apos;s a background information to get this right . You probably know all Wikipedia . The biggest Wiki in the world . The 
second largest Wiki in the world , with almost 80,000 entries , is : The World of Warcraft @ Wiki 
Five Millions of people . Use it everybody . Month . 
You have more information about World of Warcraft at the Internet , than you have about any other topic . In any other Wiki in the world , 
you create an epic story . 
You create an epic source of knowledge about the World of of Warcraft . 
OK . These are four superpowers , which are leading to a single result . Players are super @-@ powerful , hopeful individuals . 
They &apos;re people who believe they &apos;re considered as individuals to be changing the world . 
And the only problem is that they believe . They can transform the virtual worlds , but not the real ones . 
This is the problem I have to solve . 
Edward Castronova is a scientist . 
His work is brilliant . 
He &apos;s studying why people have so much time , energy and money in online worlds . 
And he says , &quot; We are witnessing no less than a mass emigration into virtual worlds and online gaming environments . &quot; 
And this from an economist . So he &apos;s logical . 
And he doesn &apos;t say the way I do . I develop games . I &apos;m a little bit exuberant . 
So he says , &quot; This actually makes sense . &quot; Because players can play more online worlds than they can in real life . 
They can play stronger social ties in games than they do in real life . They get more feedback and rewards in games . Than in real life , 
so he says , &quot; It &apos;s perfectly logical right now that players have more time in the virtual world than in real life . 
&quot; I &apos;m going to agree . That &apos;s logical . 
But it &apos;s definitely . No optimal situation . 
We have to start to build the real world into a game . 
My inspiration comes from an event . The 2,500 years back . 
There are these ancient cubes of sheep &apos;s cocks . 
You know , in front of these fantastic game econtrollers , there were sheep &apos;s cocks . 
And these were , so to speak , the first game tools that humans developed . And if you &apos;re working with the works of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus . You might know this story ? The story about how and why games were invented , 
according to Herodotus , became . Games , more precisely craps in the kingdom of Lydia , invented during famine . 
Allegedly there was such a great famine that the king of Lyndia had to become a king of lydia , a crazy idea . 
People suffered the people , people fought . 
It was an extreme situation . It took an extreme solution . 
So they invented , according to Herodotus , the craps and agreed a national strategy . On one day you would eat . The next day you would play . 
And they would play so much into the craps . There games so fascinating and we would be satisfied with satisfactory , happy productivity that they forget they would be nothing , nothing to eat . 
And then the next day you would play . And the next day you would eat . 
And according to Herodotus , they survived for 18 years . This famine by living on one day . And on the next day 
they played . And I think we &apos;re playing games today . 
We &apos;re playing games to help alleviate the suffering of the real world . We &apos;re playing games to help everything escape that &apos;s happening in the real world , not working . Everything that &apos;s happening in real life that &apos;s not satisfying . And we &apos;re getting what we need . From the games . 
But that doesn &apos;t have to be the end . 
That &apos;s the exciting thing . 
According to Herodotus , after 18 years of famine , famine didn &apos;t get any better . So the king decided one last cube game . 
They shared the kingdom in two halves . 
They played a cube game . And the winners were allowed to become an epic adventure . 
They left lydia and they got up to search for a crack new home . They just let so many people go back as they made food to survive and they were looking for the rest for a neighborhood in which they could thrive , and they were looking for a place where they could thrive . 
That sounds crazy , right ? 
But the latest DNA evidence shows that the Etruscans , who later became the Roman Empire , are the Etruscans . The same DNA as the old Lydier has . 
So scientists recently came to the conclusion that herodotus is actually crazy history . 
And geologists found evidence of global cooling that is almost 20 years long , which was the explanation of famine . 
So this crazy story could be true . Maybe 
they actually have their people through games saved by playing by getting 18 years of saving themselves in games , and they could have saved them . And then this inspiration had , and so much about coexistence with each other , that they learned by doing that , they saved the whole civilization . 
So , we can . 
We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft since 1994 . 
This was the first strategy game in real time . The World of Warcraft series . 
This was 16 years ago . 
They played 18 years of craps . We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft for 16 years . 
I &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game . 
So they sent half of their civilization to the search for the search for a new world . So I &apos;m taking my 21 billion hours of play a week . We should agree that the half of the world is one hour 
per day with games , and we should agree that we &apos;re spending half of our time playing . Until we solve the problems of the real 
world . I know you &apos;re going to ask . How do we solve problems of the real world in games ? And 
that &apos;s exactly the question I &apos;ve got my work on . In the last few years at the Institute for the Future , 
we &apos;ve been dedicating this banner in our office in Palo Alto . It expresses how we can shape the future . 
We don &apos;t want to try to predict the future before 
what we want is the future . 
We want to create the best possible outcome . And then people are empowered to empower this idea into reality . 
We face epic victories . And we give people the opportunity to give them the opportunity to reach them . 
I &apos;m going to show you three games very briefly that I designed to try and try to emulate people epic victories in their own future , in my own right . 
This is the world without oil . 
The game is from 2007 . 
It &apos;s an online game where you can see an oil shortage . 
Oil shortages are invented . But we have enough online content to make it realistic for you and you can really make your real life . In fact , live without oil . So if you &apos;re playing , if you sign up , tell us where you live . And then you get news films in real time that show you how much oil costs , what it doesn &apos;t exist . How food supplies are affected , 
how transportation is affected , whether schools are closed . Whether it &apos;s riots . And you have to figure out how to make your real life . If it were true , and we ask you to blog about it , videos or photos . 
We have this game with 1,700 , and we played in 2007 . And we &apos;ve been testing it since then over the last three years . 
And I can tell you , it was a changing experience . 
Nobody wants to change their lives because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we want to change it . 
But if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and you &apos;re told , &quot; Get us going . &quot; The oil is 
out . That &apos;s a fascinating adventure that &apos;s going on . 
Find out how you survive . Most of our players have the ones in the game that we learned . Keep habits , 
so we &apos;ve chosen to go for the next world saving game . A bigger , higher goal than just oil shortages . 
We &apos;ve got the Superstruct game at the Institute for the Future . 
The starting point is to calculate a supercomputer that people only have 23 years left to work on the planet . 
This supercomputer is called Global Dignition . Of course , awareness system , 
the call to players to sign up . Do we have almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie ? 
You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies , where it &apos;s the dream team . You have the astronaut , the scientist , the ex @-@ Sträfling , and only together can you save the world . 
But in our game , instead of just five people , we say , &quot; Everyone &apos;s on the dream team . &quot; And it &apos;s our job to build the future for energy , food , health , safety and the future of social justice . 
8,000 players played this game . Eight weeks . 
They found 500 . Incredible . Creative solutions that they can read . If you Google Superstruct and 
the last game bring us to the 3rd of March . It &apos;s a game in collaboration with the World Bank . 
If you play the game , you get from the World Bank the award of social transformers , 2010 graduation . 
We work with universities all over Sub @-@ Saharan Africa and invite them to redesign socially , learn how to do it . 
We have a comic book on this . We have levels high for regional understanding . Knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and ingenuity . 
I want to invite you all to play this game with young people . Everywhere on Earth , especially in the development areas , that benefit from this , together , sharing their own social ventures to imagine the world to 
save . I &apos;m going to finish now . 
I want to ask you something : 
What do you think is happening ? Next , 
we have all these fantastic players . We have games that show us what we &apos;re going to do . But we have the real world , not yet saved . 
Well , I hope you &apos;ll tell me that players agree that human resources are the human resources that we need to work in real life , and that games are a big issue for change . 
We have all these superpowers , happy productivity . The ability to have tight social networks , urgency optimism . And the desire for epiepiepical meaning . 
I really hope that together we will play important games . To play on this planet for another century to 
survive , and I hope you will , with me , design such games and play . 
If I go to the next decade , I &apos;m going to be sure that we &apos;re going to have every imaginable future and that we can all sorts of games play , and I think we can . So I &apos;m going to say , let &apos;s play the world @-@ changing games . Let &apos;s start . 
Thank you . 
For some time now , I &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect . It may seem strange that a game magician is interested in it . It &apos;s unless you look at it like me , as a deception that leads to something real , right ? If someone is just stuck with believing in it , 
in other words , have sugar pills . In some studies , a measurable effect has been shown to be the placebo effect , only because the person thinks what to do with it is . A pharmaceutical or some kind of in pain management . For example , if the patient is only firmly enough to get into it , there is a measurable effect in the body that is called the placebo effect . 
A deception becomes something real because it &apos;s somebody who perceives it so 
that we can each other understand each other , and I want to give you a basic , very simple magic trick . 
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . This is a trick that has been around for at least the 1950s in every magic book for kids . 
I myself have taken it from the Cub Scout Magic . The scout scout in the 1970s . 
I &apos;m going to do it for you , and then explain it . 
And then I &apos;m going to explain why I explain it . 
So you see what happens . 
The knife you &apos;re able to look at . My hand you &apos;re able to look at . 
I &apos;m going to just do the knife like this . In my fist , I &apos;m 
going to push my sleeves back . 
And to make sure that nothing in my sleeves disappears or disappears from it , I &apos;m just going to get my wrist . Right here , 
squeeze it together , in this way . You can see that there &apos;s never anything moving at any time . As long as I &apos;m pressurizing here , nothing can go into my sleeves or come out . 
And the goal is , quite simply . 
I &apos;m going to open my hand . And hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife will go through my bare physical magnetism . 
It &apos;s actually so firmly stuck on its place that I can shake it without it shaking , without the knife falling down , nothing wanders 
into my sleeve , or comes out , no trickery . And you can study everything , 
TA @-@ DA . 
Now , this is a trick that I often use to teach small kids who are looking for magic . Because you can do a lot about deception , because you can learn a lot about deception . If you look more closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick to do . 
I think many of you here probably know about this . This trick , it works . 
Here &apos;s how it works . 
I think the knife is . In my hand . 
I say I &apos;m going to close my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or comes out . And that &apos;s a lie . 
The reason I &apos;m going to tie my wrist is because it &apos;s the real secret of the illusion . 
In the moment that I &apos;m going to shake my hand away from you so that you can see it moving from behind . This finger is moving here , my index finger , just from where it was , to a position where it was stretched out like this . 
Great trick , 
there &apos;s somebody sitting behind there who had no childhood . 
So he &apos;s here right now . 
And if I turn around , the finger changes its position 
and now , you could talk about it . Why ? One deception is why you don &apos;t perceive that this is down here , just three fingers to see . Because the mind and the way that it sees information , it doesn &apos;t count individually . One , two , three , but it sees it as a group . 
But that &apos;s what this is all about here , actually , not at all . And then I open my hand . 
Of course , it &apos;s held there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but by a trick , by my index finger , which is there now . 
And if I put my hand in , the same thing happens by turning back . And by this movement , it &apos;s hidden that the finger is moving back . 
I take this hand away . And here &apos;s the knife . 
This trick you can use to get your friends and neighbors to perform . Thank you . 
Now , what does this have with the placebo effect ? 
Well , a year ago or so , I read a study that really cut me around . 
I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher . And so that was for me a really amazing thing . 
It turned out to be this . If you have a placebo in the form of a white pill , in the form . An aspirin tablet is just a round white . Pill that has a certain measurable effect . 
But if you have the shape in which you have placebo , to give placebo , for example , to a smaller pill . And this blue color and a letter on it is it is actually measurable , more effective . 
And that , though none of these are any pharmaceutical . They &apos;re just sugar pills . 
But a white pill is not that good as a blue pill . 
What that made that leave me really freaking out . 
It turned out , however , that this hasn &apos;t all happened yet . 
If you take capsules , they &apos;re even more effective than tablets . Any shape , 
a colored capsule , that &apos;s yellow at one end . And on the other side , red is better than a white capsule . The 
dosage also plays a role . 
A pill twice . Every day , it &apos;s not as good as three pills . I can now &apos;t get to the exact statistics that I remember . Do I &apos;m sorry ? 
The key thing is that 
the dosage also has a role to play , 
and the shape plays a role . 
And if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to grab the needle . 
Right ? A syringe with an ineffective one . A few milliliters , an ineffective substance , you can inject into a patient . 
That creates a very strong image in your head . This is a much stronger image than a white pill . 
This graph is really . I &apos;m going to give you another example . If we have a projector , so 
the fact is that the white pill isn &apos;t so good as the blue pill , the one that doesn &apos;t work so well . It &apos;s like a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle , 
and none of it has any really pharmaceutical property . It &apos;s just our belief in it , which is stronger in us than it is in us . 
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a magic trick . 
I take something that obviously is a deception , and I let it look real . 
We know from that study that we can say you can grab a needle if it &apos;s to get to the point . 
This is an 18 @-@ inch @-@ long needle . It &apos;s very , very sharp . And I &apos;m going to start by doing a little sterilizing it . 
This is really my flesh . It &apos;s not Damian &apos;s special . Breared meat . 
This is my skin . This is not a Hollywood special effect . 
I &apos;m going to put this needle in my skin and go through it and drive it until it &apos;s on the other side , leaving again . 
If you &apos;re getting bad , if you &apos;re easily fainting . I have this a couple of friends . Last night in the hotel room , I showed this to some people I didn &apos;t know . And there &apos;s a woman almost fainthead , and 
she &apos;s almost fainthead . I &apos;m suggesting , if you can quickly get bad , look at the room for the next 30 seconds . Or , you know what ? I &apos;m going to take the first delicate part back here . 
You can do it in a moment . You can see it also , if you want . 
So , it &apos;s going to be right here where my meat starts . Down there , at the bottom of my arm , I &apos;m just going to make a little bit of 
a break . Do I really regret ? Do you crazy about that ? 
And now , just . A little bit through my skin . And on the other side , again , 
out . Now we &apos;re actually in the same situation , which we &apos;re in with the knife trick . 
About , 
but now you can put my fingers out . Or ? 
So I &apos;m going to show you . This is one , two , three , four , five . 
Well , 
I know what people are thinking . If you see that , 
you say , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s probably not so stupid . &quot; And it &apos;s self @-@ stifling , just to give us a few minutes to entertain for us . 
Well , then I &apos;ll show you . 
What does this look like ? Very good . 
Yes . I know . And people in the back say , &quot; Okay . &quot; I have not really seen this . People 
in the adjoining rooms are now coming in . Let &apos;s 
let me tell you from near . This is 
really my skin . This is not a special effect from Hollywood . 
This is my flesh . And I can turn this around . Do 
I &apos;m sorry if you &apos;re getting bad ? Look away . Look away . Don &apos;t look at it . 
People in the back , or those who will see this on video at some point in the future , will say , Well , yes . That looks pretty much right . Impressive . But if it were real , he would see you . Here &apos;s a hole . And there , if it was really real , it would bleed . Okay . 
Let me just take a little blood for you . 
Yeah , here it is . 
Normally I would now squeeze out the needle . 
I would take my arm and clean it up and show you that there are no wounds there . 
But I think in this frame here and with the intention of getting out of a deception something real , I &apos;m going to make the needle just in there . And so , from the stage , 
we &apos;re going to go in the next few days , a few more times . 
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . Thank you very much . 
So I &apos;ve got a lot of fish in my life . 
I &apos;ve only loved two . 
This first one , which was more like a passionate affair . 
It was a beautiful one . Fish tasty . Good consistency , rich . A bestseller . On the menu . 
What a fish , 
even better . It got better in aquaculture , after the supposedly highest standards of sustainability . 
You could therefore imagine being at it , 
making it sell . I had this beauty , a relationship over several months . 
One day , the boss of the company called and asked if I was growing up at an event about the most sustainable sustainability of the farm . 
Of course , I said , 
&quot; Here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem for our chefs had become . How do we keep fish on our menus ? 
In the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the seas , how we &apos;ve been barking forests . 
It &apos;s hard to destroy , overstate . 
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the curative butte , the salmon , the swordfish . They &apos;ve collapsed . 
It &apos;s almost nothing left . 
So I think it &apos;s aquaculture that &apos;s going to be bad or bad . Fish farming . Part of our future . 
Many arguments . Against that , fish farms pollute the environment . Most of them , anyway . And they &apos;re inefficient . Let &apos;s take tuna . A big disadvantage . 
It has feed recycling of 15 percent to one . 
That means 15 pounds . Wild fish are necessary to get one pound of farmed tuna , 
not very sustainable . 
Nor does it taste very good . 
So here was finally a company . It tried to get it right . 
I wanted to support them 
the day before the event , I called the boss of public relations for the company , and I called them . 
Let &apos;s call him . 
Don Don , I just said , &quot; To get the facts . Right ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;re famous for that . So far out in the sea , you grow the environment so that you don &apos;t pollute . That 
&apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; We &apos;re so far out there that the waste from our fish is distributed , not concentrated . &quot; 
And then he added . &quot; We &apos;re basically our own world . 
This feed recovery of 2.5 to 1 &quot; he said , 
&quot; The best in the industry is 
2.5 to one . 
Great 2.5 . &quot; One : What feeds ? Your 
sustainable proteins , he said . 
&quot; Great , &quot; I said , &quot; I put up . 
&quot; And on that evening , I lay in bed thinking , &quot; What the hell is a sustainable protein ? 
&quot; So I called the next day , just before the event , Don . 
I said , &quot; Don , what , for example , are sustainable ? &quot; 
Proteins . He said he knew that . He &apos;s going to ask . 
Well , I telephoned with a couple of people in the company . Nobody could tell me a good answer until I finally got to the senior biologist on the phone , 
let &apos;s call him the same . 
Don Don said , &quot; What , for example , are sustainable ? &quot; 
Proteins . Well , he mentioned some algae . And some fishmeal . And then he said , &quot; Chicken pellets . &quot; 
I said , chicken pellets . He 
said , &quot; Yes . &quot; Feathers . Skin . Bone flour , remains dried and processed into food . 
I said , &quot; How much percent of your food is chicken ? &quot; 
Assuming maybe two percent ? 
Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , he said . 
I said , &quot; Don . &quot; &quot; What &apos;s sustainable about chicken ? Chicken to feed fish ? &quot; 
There was a long break in the pipeline . And he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chicken on the planet . &quot; 
I fell in love with this fish . 
No . Not because I was a self @-@ righteous connoisseur and a good man . 
That &apos;s me . Even 
no . I &apos;m not really impressed by this fish because I swear I swear to God , &quot; The fish after this conversation , after having tasted chicken . 
&quot; This second fish . This is another species of love story . 
It &apos;s the romantic species , the species where you ever ever better love your fish , the better you know your fish . You learn the fish , the more you love it . 
I have it first in a restaurant in southern Spain . 
A friend journalist had long been talking about this fish . She has 
kind of cuffed us . 
He came up on the table with a bright one . Almost shimmering white color . 
The cook had cooked it . 
Hold twice . 
Amazingly , he was still delicious . 
Who can buy a fish ? So good taste after having cooked it after it was cooked . 
I can &apos;t . But this guy can . 
Let &apos;s call it . Miguel . In fact , he &apos;s called Miguel . 
And no . He has the fish not cooked . And he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way they do . And I understand it as a chef , and 
he &apos;s a biologist at Veta La Palma . 
This is a fish rearing in the southwest corner of Spain . 
It &apos;s near the mouth of the river Guadalquivir , right 
down to the 1980s . The farm in the hands of Argentines . 
They grew meat cattle on what was basically wetlands . 
They did this by doing the land drainage . 
They built this complicated sequence of canals and they pushed water , they pushed water out of the country and out into the river . 
Now , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not economically , 
and environmentally , it was a disaster . 
It brought about 90 percent of the birds around , which is a lot of birds for this place . 
And so 1982 , a Spanish company with environmental awareness , the country bought . 
What did they do ? 
They did the river of water reverse . 
They literally did the lever . 
Instead of pushing out the water , they used the channels . To put the water back in . 
They flooded the channels . 
They created an 11,000 acres of fish rearing , perch , sea ash , shrimp , eel . And in doing so , Miguel and his company have completely destroyed the environment . 
The farm is incredible . 
I mean , they have something like this never seen before . They &apos;re 
staring out onto the horizon , which is a million miles away . And everything they see is flooded . Channels . And this density , lush march . 
I was there , not long ago , with Miguel . 
He &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts : Charles Darwin and one part : A crocodile for kissing . 
Okay . There we were , and we fought through wetlands . And I chash . And sweat has mud up to my knees . And Miguel keeps calm . A biology lecture . 
Here he lifts a rare track car . 
Now he mentions mineral needs of phytoplankton . 
And here . Here he sees a pattern of bundles that he &apos;s looking at in Tanzanian giraffe . 
It turns out that Miguel has the biggest part of his career in Mikumi National Park in Africa , in Africa . 
I asked him how he was going to be a fish expert . 
He said , &quot; Fish , I don &apos;t know about fish . 
I &apos;m an expert in relationships . And 
then he goes and falls and falls into more talk of rare birds and algae and algae and strange aquatic plants , 
and you don &apos;t get me wrong . &quot; That was really fascinating . You know , the biotic community , unplugged ? So , in the way 
it &apos;s great . But I was in love . 
And my head got weak over this cooked piece of delicious fish that I was eating on the eve . 
So I got him interrupted . I said , Miguel . How is it that your fish is so tasty ? He 
pointed to algae . 
I know boy , algae of phytoplankton , relationships . That &apos;s incredible . 
But what do your fish eat ? 
How is the recycling of feed ? Well 
, he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that it &apos;s the fish that eat what they eat in the wild , and it &apos;s 
the fish that eat . The vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton . That &apos;s what the fish feed . 
The system is so healthy . It &apos;s completely self @-@ explanatory . 
There &apos;s no food . 
The way a farm owns its own animals is that it doesn &apos;t feed its animals . 
Later on the day I drove on this plot with Miguel around . And I asked him . I said , &quot; For a place that &apos;s so natural , it seems different from any farm on which I ever have been . How do you measure success ? &quot; 
In the moment , it was as if a film director was demanding a stage change . 
And we bowed around the corner and us offered ourselves the opportunity for the most incredible sight : Thousands and thousands of pink flamingos . A literally pink carpet . So far as the eye can see . 
This is success . He said . 
&quot; Look at their bellies . &quot; Pink . 
They &apos;re smuggling , smuggling 
. I was completely confused . 
I said Miguel . &quot; Don &apos;t mess yours . &quot; Fish . Yes . He 
said , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re 
losing 20 percent of our fish . &quot; And fish eggs to birds . 
Well , last year , on this plot , 600,000 birds were more than 250 different species . 
It &apos;s today the largest . And one of the most important private bird reserves in Europe . 
I said , &quot; Miguel is a good thing . Fourishing bird population , not . The last thing you can do on a fish farm . &quot; 
He shook his head . No . 
He said , &quot; We &apos;re building extensively , not intensively . 
This is a green network . 
The flamingos eat the shrimps , 
the shrimps eat the phytoplankton . 
The closer the belly , the better the system . &quot; 
Okay . Let &apos;s do that again . A farm that has no feeding its animals . And a farm that is successful in its health at the predators &apos; health , 
a fish rearing , but also a bird reserve . 
Oh , and by the way , these flamingos shouldn &apos;t even be there from the outset . 
They breed in a city , 240 kilometers away , where the soil quality is better . For nest maintenance 
every morning , they fly 240 kilometers to the farm , 
and every night they fly . They fly 240 kilometers back . 
They do that because they &apos;re going to follow the beaten white line of the A92 highway . 
Seriously . 
I had a kind of journey that penguins had imagined . So I looked at Miguel . 
I said Miguel . &quot; Fly 240 kilometers to the farm and fly them . Then 240 kilometers back . &quot; In 
the evening , they do that for the kids . He 
looked at me as if I had just heard a song from Whitney Houston . 
He said , &quot; No . &quot; &quot; You do that because the food is better . &quot; &quot; 
I don &apos;t have the skin of my beloved fish mentioned . &quot; &quot; The food was delicious , and I don &apos;t like the skin of fish . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t like it sucked . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t like it crispy . 
&quot; It &apos;s this biting , charred taste . 
I cook almost never with it . And 
yet , when I put it in this restaurant in southern Spain , she even did not want to taste fish skin . 
She tasted sweet and pure as if you were eating a bite from the ocean . 
I mentioned that to Miguel . And he nodded . 
He said , &quot; The skin looks like a sponge . 
It &apos;s the last defense before anything happens in the body . 
&quot; She &apos;s got herself in evolution . She &apos;s evolved to suck up impurities . And 
then he added , &quot; But our water doesn &apos;t have impurities . Okay 
. A farm that has no fish feeding . A farm that has measured its success in the success of its predators . 
And then I realized , if it says , &quot; A farm that doesn &apos;t have impurities , it undermines enormously . &quot; Because the water that goes through this farm comes from the farm from the Guadalquivir River . 
It &apos;s a river that &apos;s all the things with it . It &apos;s a river that &apos;s now running with all the things that rivers tend to do with them . Chemical pollutants , pesticide outflow . 
And if it goes through the system , it &apos;s fought , and it leaves , the water is cleaner than it came in . 
The system is so healthy . It cleans the water , 
not just one farm that &apos;s cleaning your animals , not just one farm . Not only a farm that is successful in feeding your animals , but also a farm that is measuring their success in the health of their predators , but it &apos;s literally a water treatment plant . And not only for these fish , but also for you and me . 
Because if the water flows out , it sinks into the Atlantic , 
a drop in the ocean . I know , but I take it . And that &apos;s what you should do . Because this love story , however romantic , is also instructive . 
You might say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future , good food . Whether we &apos;re eating beef or meat cattle , 
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , of a farm in which food is . In fact , taste good . 
But for many people , this is a little too radical . 
We &apos;re not realists . We enjoy . We &apos;re lovers . 
We love weekly markets . We love small family businesses . We talk about regional food . We eat organic . 
And if you claim that &apos;s what things are that make up the future of good food . Does anybody stand up somewhere and say , &quot; Hey guys , I love pink flamingos . &quot; But how are you going to feed the world ? How 
are you going to feed the world ? 
Can I be honest . 
I like this question . Not . 
No . Not because we already have enough calories to produce the world more than just to feed the world . 
One billion people today will starve . 
One billion . That &apos;s more than ever before . Because of stark inequalities in distribution , not total production . 
Well , I like this question not because it &apos;s the logic of our food system , the last 50 years of it . 
Feed grain to vegetable eaters , pesticides to monocultures , chemicals to the Earth , chicken to fish . And the whole time , the agricultural industry has just asked . If we have more people feeding cheaper , how horrible can that be ? That 
was the reason . It was the justification . It was the business plan of American agriculture . 
We should call it what it is . It was a liquidation business . It was a fast @-@ paced greening business that was just this production that enabled it . 
That &apos;s not a business . And it &apos;s not agriculture . 
Our grain chamber is threatened today , not because of decreasing supply , but because of decreasing resources , 
not because of the latest Moravian and Tractor inventions , but because of fertile land , not because of pumps , but because of fresh water , not because of chainsaws , but because of forests , not because of fishing boats and nets , but because of fish in the sea . They 
want to feed the world . 
Let &apos;s start with the question of : How are we going to feed ourselves , 
or better ? How can we create conditions that will create conditions that enable each community to feed itself ? 
To do that . Look , don &apos;t look at the agricultural industrial model for the future . 
It &apos;s really old . And it &apos;s done : 
Capital , chemistry and machines are top of it . And it never has anything really good to eat . 
Let &apos;s look instead at the ecological model . 
This is the one that &apos;s on two billion years of work experience . Look at Miguel . 
Farmers like Miguel . Farmers like Miguel . 
Farms that don &apos;t have worlds . For themselves , farms are . Restoring them . Instead of using them up , farms . Extensive farms . Instead of just intensive farmers , who not only are producers , but experts in relationships . 
Because they are the ones who are experts on taste . 
And if I really am honest , they are a better cook . When I ever be , 
you know , you know , that &apos;s right . Because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious . 
Thank you . 
I grew up with a lot of science fiction , 
in my school days , I drove with the bus to school . Every day , an hour per way . And my 
nose was always in a book , a science fiction book . That was my thoughts into other worlds , and narratives that took my deep into me , deep inside . Insatiable curiosity satisfied . 
This curiosity was also shown by the fact that whenever I was not in the school , I was always being driven through the woods , wandering and sampling , collecting frogs and snakes and beetles and pond water , bringing everything home . And under the microscope , 
I looked at , &quot; I was total . Science enthusiasts . 
&quot; You know , it always was about the attempt to make the world understand and the world &apos;s limits of what could be . 
And my love of science fiction seemed to have appeared in my environment . Because back then , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea , 
Jacques . Cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating shows that we had animals and places and a world full of wonders , showing us the world we never had imagined before , and we had a great experience of it . 
This is what I think has got to that science fiction role . 
And I was an artist . 
I could draw . I could paint , 
and since it &apos;s not video games , nor this saturation with computer @-@ generated films , nor the whole visual language in the media landscape , I had to create the images in my head . 
That &apos;s what we all had to do at the time . If we were kids , we read a book , we took the author &apos;s description and projected it onto the screen in our heads . 
My reaction to that was drawing and painting of aliens aliens aliens &apos; worlds , robots , spacecraft and all of that in math classes , 
I was constantly caught by the teacher , like I was hiding behind the textbook . 
So , around , creativity had to sort of get out of it . 
And it was an interesting thing . What happened to me was Jacques Cousteaus &apos; shows , and what fascinated me was the idea of a world that we knew completely unknowingly . Here on our planet , certainly , 
I would never have a alien world with an alien world with a spaceship . That seemed pretty unlikely to me . 
But here was a world I was actually entering , actually . Here on Earth . And it was just as fascinating and exotic . Like all of this . What I always imagined was when I was going to read these books . 
So I decided when I was 15 , I was going to become a diver . 
The only problem with this was that I was in a small village in Canada , one thousand kilometers from the nearest ocean , 
right ? And I let myself not be discouraged by this . 
I was annoying my father until he finally got a diving school in Buffalo , New York , right on the spot , right on the other side of the border , where we lived . 
I made my diving certificate in a pool of YMCA , right in winter in Buffalo , New York , 
the ocean . But a real ocean I got . I got a real ocean just two years later when we moved to California , 
since we moved to California in the 40 years that have passed , I &apos;ve been under water for about 3,000 hours . 500 hours of that in submersible boats . 
And I &apos;ve learned that the world of deep sea itself is in the flatter oceans , so rich in fascinating life , as we are in the really scarcely imagined world . The imagination of 
nature doesn &apos;t know any boundaries . It &apos;s quite unlike our own miserable human imagination , 
up to this day , that it feels . I have the deepest awe for what I have to see on my dives . 
And my love of the ocean continues with the same intensity as ever . And ever as I 
got to be an adult , I chose a profession , it was filmmaking . 
That seemed to be the best way to make my inner urge to tell stories . With my need to create images , 
to unite . As a child , I kept drawing comic books . And so on . 
So films were the way , pictures and stories were brought together . That fit together . 
Of course , the stories I was choosing were from the science fiction field : Terminator , Aliens and Abyss . At 
Abyss , I could share my preference for the underwater world . And diving with the filmmaking was connecting . 
So the stuff that I did is my two passions intertwined . 
Something interesting happened at Abyss to make a narrative problem . In this movie , solving this problem , and that was , we had to create a kind of liquid water system , we attacked computer @-@ generated animation . CG : 
What came out of this was . The first computer @-@ generated soft surface figure ever to be seen in a movie . 
The film did not bring money , though . In fact , it just played its production costs . But I noticed something fascinating : The audience on the whole world was like hypnotized by hypnotized magic of the magic that 
came out of it . According to Arthur Clarke &apos;s law , advanced technology and magic are , as you know , advanced . No longer to distinguish . 
They saw something magical . 
And that &apos;s what I found incredibly exciting . 
And I thought , wow . That absolutely must be in the art of film . So 
we went to Terminator 2 , my next movie , a lot further . 
Together with ILM , we created the guy there from liquid metal . The success was very much dependent on how this effect would arrive . 
And it worked . Again , we had created something magical . And the effect in the audience was the same . But we did with the film already have a little more money . 
Recorded by these two experiences , the idea was a whole new world . A whole new world of creativity for filmmakers . 
So I started a company with a company , along with my good friend Stan Winston , who was the best make @-@ up and creature designer at that time , called Digital Domain . 
The basic idea of this company was to start the phase of analog processes with optical printers , etc . , and jump over to digital productions . 
And we did that , and we managed to do it . For a while , 
we had a competitive advantage . But in the mid @-@ 1990s , we realized that we were in the Creature and Character Design , for which we actually founded the company , too slowly . 
I had this piece of Avatar written that the bar on the visual effects and computer @-@ generated effects across new lines , pushing the bar up to realistic human expressive characters that were being made using CG , and that was the way it was done . And the main characters were all going to be CG , and the world was going to be CG . 
But the bar pressed pretty much back . And people in my company said , &quot; Well , for the time being , we &apos;re not yet able to do that . 
So I shifted that , and I did this other movie about the big ship . 
&quot; That goes to the studio , I have that as Romeo and Juliet on a ship , sold it . It became a love movie of epic proportions . A 
passionate movie , secret . But did I actually want to become a real wreck ? The Titanic : Dive 
down . That &apos;s why I made the film . 
That &apos;s the truth . The studio knew that , but not . 
I got it convinced , though , by saying , &quot; We dive to the wreck . &quot; We film the real wreck . 
We &apos;ll do it in the opening sequence of the film . 
That &apos;s incredibly important . It &apos;s a good trailer for marketing . And 
I persuaded you to make an expedition finance . 
Sounds crazy . But that &apos;s going to be back to the fact that your imagination creates a reality . 
We then actually created six months later a reality in which we created a reality in which I was found in a Russian submersible , four kilometers below the surface of the North Atlantic , and I was able to see the real Titanic through a bullet . This was 
not a movie . No HD . This was real . 
So this has really bypassed me . 
And the preparations for this were enormous . We had to have cameras and headlights and everything . 
And I fell on how much these deep @-@ sea dive gears resembled a space mission . 
Well , they were also high @-@ tech and needed extensive planning . 
You go up into this capsule , and then you float into this dark , hostile environment , where there is no hope of salvation . If you don &apos;t return it yourself 
and I thought to myself , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s the same as if I were in a science fiction movie . 
&quot; That &apos;s really cool . I 
was really obsessed with exploring the deep sea . 
Anyway , from the part that was curious and science to do with it . It was all . It was adventure . It was curiosity . It was imagination . 
And it was an experience that I had not had Hollywood experience . 
Because , you know , I could be imagined as a creature for which we would then have a visual effect . But I could not imagine that . What I could imagine outside the window was 
what I would see . Some of the expeditions that followed , I have entities in thermal springs . And sometimes things that I &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that I &apos;ve seen at all , things that nobody had ever seen before . And for those who have science at the time we saw it , even no words 
for those who had found it . That &apos;s what really turned me around . And I wanted more . 
And so I met a little bit unusual decision after that , 
after the success of Titanic , I said , &quot; Okay . I want to be my main profession as a filmmaker in Hollywood on ice , and I &apos;m going to be a full @-@ time researcher for a while . &quot; 
And then we started these expeditions to plan . 
We showed up to Bismarck and we explored them with robotic vehicles . 
We went back to the wreck of the Titanic . 
We took small robots that we built that we had a fiber optic cable . 
Our intention was to dive in and get inside the ship and see what never before has been done . 
Nobody had ever had the inside of the wreck explored . You had not had the tools to do that . So we developed the technology we needed . 
So , there I am now sitting on the deck of the Titanic in a submersible boat and I see planks planking these boards here that are quite similar . And of those I know once that once the band was playing there . 
And I &apos;m flying with a little robot vehicle through the corridors of the ship . 
I &apos;m using it , actually . But my consciousness is within the vehicle . 
It felt like it was me that I was physically inside the ship wreck of the Titanic . 
That was the surreal form of a déjà vu that I &apos;ve ever experienced . Because before I was asked to go around a corner , I always knew what was going to happen in the light cone of the vehicle . Because I &apos;ve been running over the movie set for months when we shot the film . 
The set was actually a copy of the blueprints of the ship . 
This was a very strange experience , 
then . It made me this telepresence experience realize that you could have such robotic avatars . And so , your consciousness into that vehicle , into that other form of existence , is able to move . 
It was really incredibly profound , 
and maybe also a little bit of a view of what might be going on in a few decades . If you have cyborg bodies to do some research or other things , or you have cyborg bodies . In all sorts of post @-@ human future scenarios that I think I can imagine as a science fiction fan . 
After these expeditions , we started what we were down there seeing , and we started to see what we had seen . We really appreciated learning . For example , these deep @-@ sea equals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . These are , like , aliens . But here on Earth . 
They live with the help of chemosynthesis . 
They don &apos;t exist in sunlight . How do we do that 
? And this is how you see animals right next to a 500 degrees Celsius water cloud , living right there . And 
you can &apos;t imagine that you 
&apos;re there to survive . Same time , I was also interested in being a space scientist . This was again the science fiction influence . From my childhood 
and so I ended up with people who were struggling for the space world , and people who were interested in NASA , and who were involved in NASA . And in NASA &apos;s expert council , they &apos;re sitting there planning real space missions . They &apos;re going to Russia , going through before the mission . The biomedical protocol , and everything , and all the drum and drum , then fly to the International Space Station and take our 3D camera systems . 
This was fascinating . 
But at the end of the day , it was that I was going to be a space scientist with us in the deep sea . 
I was going to take them and I was going to give them access to the world . Down there , astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were in the interest of such extreme situations . I took them to the sources with me so that they could look around , take samples and test instruments , and so on . 
We turned documentary films . But actually science , more specifically space science . 
So this is how the circle between my existence as a science fiction fan , then as a child , closed . And the implementation into reality . 
Over the course of this discovery journey , I learned a lot . 
I learned a lot about science , a lot . But I also learned a lot about leadership . 
Now , you probably think a director must lead , a director must be able to be like a ship captain or something . 
I understood , but not much about leadership . Before I started these expeditions , 
because I was at a certain point , I had to tell myself , what am I doing here ? 
Why am I doing this ? What &apos;s coming out of this ? These 
stupid movies bring us no money . We &apos;ll just play 
the production costs , one of fame , no trace . 
Everybody thinks I &apos;m between Titanic and Avatar . Walked away and would have somewhere nails on a towel . On the beach , celebrated . 
I &apos;ve all these movies , these documentary films for a very small audience . 
No fame . No honor . No money . What do you do ? 
You do it around the task for the sake of the challenge and the ocean is the ocean &apos;s most challenging environment that exists . You do it of exploratory space . And because of the strange connection that emerges when a small group of people , a team , forms . 
Because we have all of this with just 10 to 12 people , who have been doing continuous cooperation for years . Sometimes we were two to three months in a row at sea . 
And in this community , you can see that the most important thing is respect , the respect that you have for each other , because you &apos;ve done a job that you can &apos;t explain to anyone else . 
If you &apos;re going back to land and you say , &quot; We had to do it . &quot; The fiberglass , the sound attenuation and the all around , the whole technology and the difficulties . The human power when you &apos;re at sea , if you &apos;re working at sea , you can &apos;t explain that to others . That &apos;s like policemen or policemen or soldiers who do something in common , and they &apos;re not . And they know they never have somebody explaining it . 
And there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect . 
When I came back to see my next movie , Avatar , I tried to create the same leadership style , which is that you respect your team and in exchange for their respect . 
And that made the dynamics really 
different . And I stood there again with a little team , unknown to me . And we turned Avatar with a new technology that it used to be , and it didn &apos;t exist before . 
It was incredibly exciting , 
it was a tremendous challenge . 
And we became a huge challenge for a four and a half years to become a real family . 
And that changed my way of making films completely . 
There were people who thought we had these ocean properties , yeah , really good . And on the planet Pandora was transported . For 
me , it was more a principled way of doing my job . The actual process , which resulted in change , has changed . 
What can we do from all of this ? 
What lessons do we learn ? 
I believe in the first place is curiosity . 
It &apos;s the most powerful human property . Our 
imagination is a force that even has a reality to create . 
And respect for your team is more important than all the laurels of this world come 
to me . Young filmmakers who say , &quot; Give me advice on how I can do this kind of thing . &quot; 
And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t limit you . &quot; Even one . 
That &apos;s already getting others for you . Try it , don &apos;t do it for you . Self bet , don &apos;t bet against yourself , but take risks , take risks . 
NASA has this kind of favorite sentence : Failure is not an alternative . But 
in art and art and in exploration , failure has to be an alternative . Because that &apos;s where it guarantees a trust advance , not 
an important undertaking , innovation . It was ever demanded , without risk , to be addressed . 
You have to be ready . Such risks have 
to be taken . That &apos;s the idea I &apos;m going to share with you on the way . Failure is a very alternative fear . But is not one ? Thank you . 
If I can give you a little bit of a little bit of a closer today , it &apos;s that the whole data we consume is larger than the sum of your pieces . And instead of overloading information , instead of thinking about overloading information , I want you to think about how we can use information to create patterns . And we &apos;re seeing trends that otherwise don &apos;t become visible . 
So what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical death chart based on age . 
The program I &apos;m using here is a little experiment . 
It &apos;s called Pivot . And what I &apos;m doing with Pivot is that I &apos;m going to be able to filter for a certain cause of death . Let &apos;s say accidents , 
and I &apos;ll see another pattern immediately , which emerges . 
And that &apos;s because in the middle , here , people are most active . And you over here , they &apos;re most frail . 
We can take a step further out and sort out the data , then look again , and see that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everybody . 
If we go further and age @-@ sort them , we say 40 years or younger . Let &apos;s see that accidents are even the main cause of the accidents that people worry about , and they should be . 
And who &apos;s going to study it ? See , this is particularly true for men . 
You can see , then , that the image of information and data in this way is very much swimming . In a vivid information graph . 
And if we think about raw data , why not ? Why not content itself ? 
What we &apos;re having here is the cover images . Each and every one of the Sports Illustrated people who have ever been printed . 
It &apos;s all here . It &apos;s all online . 
You can like to do it after I gave my talk in your rooms . 
With Pivot , you can dive into a decade . 
You can dive into a given year . 
You can dive directly to a particular issue . 
If I &apos;m looking here , I see the athletes who are in this issue and they &apos;re sports . 
I &apos;m a Lance Armstrong fan . So I click here to see what all the issues show me in which Lance Armstrong mentions Lance Armstrong . 
Now , if I just have a bigger overview , I could think , OK ? What ? If I could do everything about the subject of cycling , 
so I &apos;m going to take a step back and expand the perspective . 
Now I &apos;m looking at Greg Lemon . 
And so you get an idea of the idea that if you look at this kind of information , you zoom in more targeted , wider , more pure . Then you don &apos;t look for or surf . Not just . 
You do something that is actually a little different . 
It &apos;s something in between . And we think it changes the way that you do information . 
I want to use this idea a little bit more , with something like what a little crazy is . 
What we did here is we did . We have every single wikipedia page , and we put it in a little summary . 
The summary contains a quick overview , and a symbol of the area from which you can come . 
I &apos;m just going to show you the top 500 of the most popular wikipedia pages . 
But even in this narrow view , we can see a lot of things . 
Immediately , we get an idea of the issues that are on Wikipedia most popular . 
I &apos;m going to talk about government now . 
Now , after I &apos;ve elected government , I realize that the Wikipedia categories that are most concerned with this are Time Magazines , people of the year . 
This is really important . Because this is a realization that is not in a single Wikipedia page . 
This is just to be seen . If you take a step back , and look at the whole thing , 
look at a particular one . These summaries , can I then go into the theme of Time Magazines ? People of the Year go in and everybody together see . 
If I now look at all these people , I realize that the majority of them are government officials . Some of them come from science . Some even less come from economics . Here &apos;s my boss . And one comes from music . 
And interestingly , Bono is also a TED Prize winner . 
So we can jump and win a look at everybody TED , and we can take a look at all the TED Prize winners . 
You can see we surf the web . The first time , it &apos;s like it &apos;s really a web , not just from side to side , but a lot more abstract . 
And so I want to tell you something else that a little surprise might be . 
I &apos;m going to just show you the New York Times website . 
Pivot , this application . I want it not to be called a browser . It &apos;s really not a browser . But you can use it to look at websites . And we bring this zoom technology to every single website like this . 
I can , therefore , go back a step and go straight to a specific section . 
This is important because you only need to go through looking at websites in this way , and you can do all the Internet history in the same way , 
looking at the web pages . I can , therefore , zoom in into 
my course , in a certain time frame . Here &apos;s the state of play of the entire demonstration that I &apos;ve kept going up to now . 
And I can sort of do everything I &apos;ve seen so far . I can get back . 
And if I get back a step and get back on everything , I can get back to rearrange my course . Maybe after my search past . Here I am , looking for nepotistic . Here &apos;s Bing , or here &apos;s live Labs Pivot . 
And from here , I can go to the page and put it back on . 
It &apos;s a metaphor that keeps coming to use . And every time it does the overall picture , it &apos;s bigger than the sum of the data pieces . 
Right now , in this world , we think that data is a curse . 
We talk about the curse of the abundance of information . 
We talk about drowning in information . 
What if we were to turn this situation around and turn the Internet upside down , like this , so instead of always being from one to the other , we start from many things to many things to many things to go . And by doing this , we see patterns that would otherwise have been hidden . 
If we do this , then it will be this data trap that we &apos;ve seen so far , maybe a new source of meaningful information . 
And instead of just just getting information , instead of just moving around . We know , get it out of it . 
And if we know , then we can maybe even know wisdom from it . 
So I stop . Thank you very much . 
Everybody &apos;s talking today about happiness . 
I have some people , the number of books counting , the number of books titled Happiness in the title , in the last five years . And they gave , after about 40 . And there were a lot more . 
There &apos;s a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers . 
There &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching . 
Everybody would like to make people happier . 
But despite all this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps that make it kind of impossible , so to speak . Sure . About thinking about happiness 
and my talk today is mostly about these cognitive traps , which will act . 
That &apos;s true for laymen who are talking about their own happiness . And it &apos;s true for scientists who are thinking about happiness because it turns out we &apos;re just as confused as we are with everybody else . 
The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity . 
It turns out that this word is happiness , just not a useful word anymore , because we &apos;re putting it on too many different things , too many different things . 
I think there &apos;s a certain meaning to which we apply it to , you know ? But in general , it &apos;s a little bit that we &apos;re going to have to give up . And we &apos;re going to take the complicated view . We &apos;re going to have to take the second view of what well @-@ being is . 
Trap is a confusion of experience and memory . Basically , it &apos;s between happiness , being happy . In his life and being happy about his life or being happy with his life . 
And these are two very different concepts . And they &apos;re both thrown together in the idea of happiness . 
And the third is the concentration illusion . And that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we don &apos;t have a circumstance to think about . Well @-@ being affects without affecting its meaning . 
I mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive trap . 
There &apos;s just no way . It &apos;s right to get it right . 
Now I &apos;d like to take an example from someone who &apos;s going to have a question @-@ and @-@ answer session . After one of my lectures , which was a story , it was unclear . He said he had a symphony heard . And it was absolutely wonderful music . And it was at the very end of the recording , there was a terrible , creeping sound . 
And then he added , &quot; Really , quite emotional . &quot; That &apos;s got all the experience ruined . 
But that &apos;s not 
what it had ruined . The memories of the experience were . 
He had had the experience . 
He had 20 minutes of wonderful music . 
They didn &apos;t count because he had a memory that he had stayed with . The memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had to keep up with . 
What this really tells us is that we &apos;re talking about ourselves and about other people , and we could think about ourselves . In the sense of two kinds of self . 
There &apos;s an enlivening self that is in the present . And the present knows how capable it is of rebuilding the past . But basically , only the present has 
it , it &apos;s the living self that the doctor prides . You know , if the doctor asks , &quot; Is it hurting now ? &quot; If I can touch you here . And 
then there &apos;s a memory self . And the memory self is that . It &apos;s that that micks and the story of our lives keeps up . And it &apos;s that that the doctor addresses by touching the doctor &apos;s question . How did you feel at home recently ? Or 
what was your journey to Albania or something like that ? 
These are two very different units . The living self . And the remembering self . And the two to be confused is part of the coexistence of the term happiness . 
Well , the remembering self is a storyteller . 
And that really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memories . It starts immediately . 
We don &apos;t just tell stories . If we remember it , stories become stories , 
our memory tells us stories . That means what we &apos;re talking about , what we &apos;re allowed to keep from our experiences , is a story . 
And let &apos;s not let you take an example . 
There &apos;s an old study . 
These are real patients who are one of the painful procedures . 
I &apos;m not going to go into detail . It &apos;s not anymore painful today . But it was painful when this study was conducted in the 1990s . 
They were asked to do it every 60 seconds for their pain to be reported . And 
here are two patients . These are their records . 
And they &apos;re asked , who of both has suffered more ? And 
that &apos;s a very simple question . 
Patient B clearly has suffered more . His intestinal reflection was longer and every minute of pain . Patient A had had patient B had patient B and more . 
But now there &apos;s another question . How much did these people think that they suffered from it ? And 
here &apos;s a surprise . And 
the surprise is that patient A has a much worse memory of patient A &apos;s intestinal reflection than patient B. Patient B. has 
the stories of intestinal reflections different . And because a very critical part of the story is how you end . 
And none of these stories is very edifical or great . But one of them is this : Clear . But one of them is clearly worse than the other , 
and the one that is worse was the one where the pain was all at the end of its peak , at the top . It &apos;s a bad story . 
How do we know that ? 
Because we &apos;re looking at these people for their spinal reflections , and much later on , how bad was the whole thing ? And 
it was much worse for A than for B in B in memory . 
Well , this is a direct conflict between the living self and the remembering self 
from the point of view of the living self . B had a clearly worse time . 
Now , what you do with patient A ? And we actually have clinical experiments . And it &apos;s been done . And it works . You could actually do the intestinal reflection of patient A by extending just the tube in there , without having to do too much with it , too . 
That &apos;s going to make the patient suffer . But only a little bit less and much less than before . 
And if you do that for a few minutes , you have done it to make the living self of patient A worse off than that . And you have made it to make the remembering self of patient A much better off with it . Because now you have patient A , a better story about your experience , given you . 
What makes a story look like ? 
And that &apos;s true of the stories that memory tells us . And it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent , which 
makes a story unique , and so on . Changes , significant moments and ends . 
Ends are very , very important . And in this case , the end dominated . 
Now , the living self lives his life continuously . 
It has moments of experience , one after the other . 
And you ask , what happens to these moments ? 
And the answer is really simple . They &apos;re forever lost . 
I mean , most moments of our lives . And I have calculated that . You know , the psychological present is considered to be for about three seconds . What does knowledge mean ? You know , in a life it &apos;s about 600 million of them . In a month , there &apos;s about 600,000 . Most of you leave no trace of that . 
Most of you will be completely ignored by the memory self . 
And yet , somehow you get the impression that you should count , that what &apos;s going to happen during these moments of experience . Our life is , 
it &apos;s the limited resource that we consume , while we &apos;re on this world . 
And how we consume it would seem to be important . But that &apos;s not the story that the memory self is for us to retain . 
So we have the memory self . And the living self . And they &apos;re really quite different . 
The biggest difference between them is the way they deal with time . 
From the perspective of the living . Even if you &apos;re on vacation and you &apos;re on a second week just as good as the first week . Then the two @-@ week holiday is twice as good as the one @-@ week holiday . 
That &apos;s how it doesn &apos;t work at all . For the remembering self , 
for the remembering self , a two @-@ week holiday is hardly better than the one @-@ week holiday . Because there &apos;s no new memories added . 
You have the story not changed . 
And to do that , time is actually the critical variable , which is a distinguishing memory self from a living self , time has . Very little influence on this story . 
Now , the memory self does more than remember and stories make more than tell . 
It &apos;s actually the one . The decisions are made , because if you have a patient who , let &apos;s say , has two intestinal reflections with two different surgeons , and decides which one to choose . Then the one who chooses is the one who has the memory , who &apos;s less bad . And that &apos;s the surgeon who has to be selected . 
The living self doesn &apos;t have a voice . In this election , actually , 
we don &apos;t choose between experiences . We choose between memories of experiences . 
And even if we think about the future , we think about our future , usually not as experiences . 
We think about our future as our expected memories . 
And basically , they can look at that . You know , as a tyranny of the memory self . And you can imagine the memory self , as one . That , so to speak . The living self drags through experiences that make the living self not need . 
I have the impression that if we leave , that &apos;s very common , it &apos;s the case . That means we make vacation , largely at the service of the memory self . 
And that &apos;s a little hard to justify , I think . 
I mean , how much do we feed from our memories ? 
That &apos;s one of the explanations that &apos;s been given for the dominance of the memory self . 
And when I think about that , I think about a vacation that we &apos;re going to spend a few years ago in Antarctica , which is clearly the best vacation we &apos;ve ever had . And I think relatively often about it relative to how often I have to think about other vacations . 
And I probably heard about my memories of these three @-@ week trips . I would say about 25 minutes for about 25 minutes in the last four years . 
Drilled . Well , if I ever open the folder with the 600 folders of the images in it , I would have spent another hour . 
Now , that &apos;s three weeks . And that &apos;s at most . One and a half hours . 
There it seems to be disagreement . 
Well , I like a little bit extreme . You know , in it , how little appetite I have for feeding memories ? But even if you have more of it , there &apos;s a real question . Why do we give memories so much weight in the scourge to weight , the weight we give experiences ? 
So I want you to talk about a thought experiment . So 
imagine your next vacation , imagine . You know that at the end of the vacation , all your pictures are destroyed . And you get an amnesty drug like this , so you get nothing to remember . 
Now , would you like to choose the same vacation ? And if you want to choose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two two species of self . And you have to think about how you &apos;re going to decide this conflict . And that &apos;s really not obvious at all . Because if you &apos;re going to be thinking about time , you get an answer . And if you &apos;re thinking about memories , you could have a different answer , you could get a different one . 
Why we &apos;re going to choose the vacations that we choose is a problem that confronts us with a choice between a choice between the two types of self . 
Well , the two kinds of self throw two terms of happiness : 
There are actually two concepts of happiness : The ones that we can apply , one per self . 
You can ask , how happy is it ? The living self . 
And then you would ask , how happy are the moments in life of the living self ? 
And you &apos;re all lucky for moments . Is a fairly complicated process . 
What are the emotions ? They are what can be measured . 
And by the way , we are now able to have a pretty good idea . Of the happiness of the living self over time . 
If you look after the happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a very different thing . 
This is not about how happy a person lives . 
It &apos;s about how satisfied or happy . The person is when that person is informed about his or her life , 
very different terms . 
Anyone who thinks about these terms is not different . Research into happiness masks . And I &apos;m one of a lot of researchers about well @-@ being , who is researching happiness long masking . It &apos;s exactly this way that distinguishes between happiness , happiness 
, happiness , happiness , the living self . And happiness , memory self , is in the last few years recognized , you know . And now you &apos;re trying to make the two separate measurements . 
Gallup Organization has a global survey , which shows more than one in half a million people asking questions about the world . What they &apos;re asking about their lives and their lives and their experiences . And there were other efforts in the direction . 
In the last few years , we &apos;ve started to think about the happiness of the two kinds of self . 
And the main lesson we think we have learned , I think , is that they really are different . 
You can know how satisfied someone is with his life . And that &apos;s what she really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happy he lives his life . And vice versa , 
just to give you an idea of the correlation . The correlation is about five percent 
, which means that if you &apos;re somebody you would meet and you would meet them , you &apos;d say , &quot; Oh , his father is a two @-@ meter man . &quot; How much would you know about his height ? 
Well , you would know about his size . But there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty . 
You have so much uncertainty . 
If I tell you that somebody is going to spend his life as eight on a scale of 10 . Do you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self ? 
The correlation is therefore low . 
We know something about what happiness is about happiness self . 
We know that money is very important . Goals are very important . 
We know happiness is essentially content , content is content with people who we like , time to spend , with people who we like . 
There are other pleasures . But that &apos;s dominant . 
If you do happiness , then , for the two kinds of self to maximize . Will you end up with very different things ? 
The conclusion from what I &apos;m here saying is that what I said here is that we really don &apos;t think of happiness as a substitute for well @-@ being . 
It &apos;s a completely different term . 
Now , very briefly , another reason for us not to be clear about happiness is for happiness to think that we don &apos;t think about the same things . If we think about life and think about life , and if we actually live . 
If you think about the simple question of how happy people are in California , then you &apos;re not going to be the right answer . 
If you ask that question , think that the people in California are happier than they are . If you say , &quot; We live in Ohio , 
and what happens is that if you talk about life in California , think about life in California , think about the difference between California and other places . &quot; And that difference is , say , climate . 
Well , it turns out climate is not very important for climate , for the living self . And it &apos;s not even very important for the thoughtful self to think about . That decides how happy people are . 
Well , because the thoughtful self is responsible . Can you end up having some people ? Could at the end move to California ? 
And it &apos;s kind of interesting to track . What happens to people who go to California , in the hope of being happier ? 
Well , their self that lives is not going to get happier . 
We know that . 
But one thing is going to happen . They &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier . Because if you think about that , you &apos;re going to be reminded of how terrible the weather in Ohio was . And you &apos;re going to feel you &apos;re making the right decision . 
It &apos;s very difficult to tell clearly about well @-@ being . And I hope I &apos;ve got you an idea of how well @-@ being is . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question for you . 
Thank you . 
Well , when we started thinking about phone a few weeks ago , you told me that it was a pretty interesting result that came out of this Gallup survey , 
and if that &apos;s something that you &apos;re going to be able to share with us , because you have a few minutes left . 
Daniel Kahneman : Sure . 
I think the most interesting result we have in the Gallup survey is the one we found in the number that we absolutely don &apos;t expect to find . 
We found that in terms of the happiness of the survivor . 
Even if we looked at how feelings with the income vary , 
and it represents itself , it turns out that under an income of 60,000 , dollars in a year , for Americans . And that &apos;s a very big sample of Americans . About 600,000 . But it &apos;s a big representative sample . Under an income of 600,000 dollars , in the year . 
About 60,000 . 
DK : 60,000 , 
60,000 . In the year , people are unhappy . And they &apos;re getting increasingly unhappy . The poorer they get about 
that , we get an absolutely flat line . 
I mean , I rarely have such flat lines seen . 
What happened is , obviously , money doesn &apos;t get you experience happiness . But that lack of money certainly gives you misery . And we can get this misery , very , very clearly measured . 
In the sense of the other , even the remembering self , you get a different story . 
The more money you make , the more satisfied you are . 
That &apos;s not true of emotions . 
CA : But Danny , throughout America &apos;s endeavor , it &apos;s about life . Freedom , the endeavor for happiness . 
When people find this finding seriously , I would mean . It all seems to be upside down . Everything we believe to be , for example , in tax policy and so on , 
there &apos;s an opportunity that politicians , that the country in general , has a finding like Ernst , would take it seriously . And based on that , politics would do 
DK . You know ? I think it &apos;s recognition for being able to play the role of gambling research in politics . 
Recognition is slowly going to be . In the United States , no question . But in the United Kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now . And in other countries , it &apos;s happening right now . 
People are in the process of recognizing that they think of happiness . If you think about politics , 
it &apos;s going to take a while . And people are going to discuss whether you &apos;re going to explore experience happiness , or whether you want to explore life assessment . So we need to really soon discuss this discussion , 
how to increase happiness . So , it &apos;s very different . Depending on that . How you think ? And whether you think about the memory self or whether you think about the living self , or whether you think about the living self . 
That &apos;s going to affect politics , I think , in the years to come , 
in the United States . If you tighten yourself to the experience happiness of the population . 
That &apos;s going to , I think , be in the next one or two decades , part of the national statistics . 
CA : Well , it seems to me that this topic is going to , or should , at least be the most interesting political debate to follow . About the next few years . 
Thank you very much . For inventing the behavioral economy . 
Thank you . Danny Kahneman : Today 
I &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate . 
And that might surprise you a little bit , because my full @-@ time work at the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds , about the things we invent and deliver , about the poorest two billion , about a better life for the poorest . 
But energy and climate are extremely important . For these people , in fact , even more important than for anyone else on the planet . 
Climate degradation means that their seeds are growing for many years to come , and we &apos;re going to grow too much or too little rain . Things are going to change as things change as they create their fragile environment can &apos;t sustain . 
That leads to starvation . It leads to insecurity . It leads to unrest . 
So , climate change is going to be terrible for you . And 
also , the energy price for you is very important . 
The fact is , if you &apos;re just talking about one thing , you could reduce the price , to reduce poverty , energy . By far the most effective , 
now the energy price is over time . 
In fact , the progress society is based on energy progress . 
Coal evolution drove industrial revolution . And even in the 20th century , there was a rapid fall in the electricity price . And so we have refrigerators , air conditioning . We can use modern materials . And so many things we 
do : We &apos;re in a state of great situation with electricity in the rich world , 
in the rich world . But if we pay down the price , we let the price halve . Let &apos;s meet a new barrier . And this barrier is related to CO2 , 
CO2 warms the planet and the equation for the CO2 is . Actually , pretty clear . 
They sum up . The CO2 emitted , which leads to temperature increase . And this temperature increase has some very negative effects , effects on the weather . And maybe worse , the indirect effect is that natural ecosystems are so rapidly changing that they don &apos;t adapt . And so whole systems collapse . 
Now , the exact link between a CO2 increase and the resulting temperature change , and where they continue to follow . There are some ambiguities , but not very many . 
And there are certainly ambiguities about how bad these consequences will be . But they will be extremely bad . 
I have the top scientists several times asked , &quot; Do we really have to get down to near zero ? 
&quot; &quot; Is not half or a quarter enough ? 
&quot; The answer is , until we get near zero . Will the temperature rise further ? That &apos;s 
why it &apos;s a big challenge . 
It &apos;s very different from saying , &quot; We have a 3.5 meter high . &quot; It &apos;s under a three @-@ meter bridge . It has to be here . You can sort of squeeze it down below . This 
has to be downward @-@ looking to zero . 
Well , we run into a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons . 
Every American , about 20 tons of people from poor countries , less than one on average , 
it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet . 
And somehow we need to create changes that can bring that down to zero . 
It &apos;s been constantly increasing . 
Only different economic changes have made it even affect . And we need to be moved from rapid growth to reduction and to a reduction , except zero . 
This equation has four factors : A bit of multiplication . You have this thing on the left , CO2 , that you want to get to zero . And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen to the number of people , to the services that every human being uses on average , the average energy for every service , and the CO2 per unit of energy . 
It &apos;s emitted . Let &apos;s do every factor individually . And let &apos;s think about how we can get that to zero . 
Probably , one of these numbers has to be very close to . Zero . 
Now , that &apos;s basic algebra . But let &apos;s go through it . 
First of all , we have the population . 
Today , 6.8 billion people live 
and it &apos;s screaming at 9 billion to the tune of 9 billion to 
the tune of 9 billion . If we succeed very successfully with new vaccines , healthcare and reproductive medicine . Could we possibly do that by 10 to 15 percent ? But at the moment , we &apos;re seeing a 1.3 percent rise . 
The second factor is services , the services we use . 
This includes everything : Food that we eat , clothing , television , heating . 
These are very good things . And poverty reduction means these services almost to everyone on the planet accessible to them . 
It &apos;s great that this number is rising 
in the rich world , in the top billion , we might be able to make cuts and use less . But on average , this number is going to rise every year , and so overall , it &apos;s more than doubling . The number of services per person per person is going to increase . 
Here we see a very basic service . Are there at home lights to make sure you read the homework ? 
And these students have not . So they go out and read their homework under the street light . 
Now , effectiveness , the E , the energy per service , finally there &apos;s good news . 
We have something that doesn &apos;t go up . 
Because of different successes in the lighting sector , because of other types of cars , because of new methods in building houses . There are many services that you spend drastically on reducing energy , drastically reducing it . 103.00 , 
05.50 , 000 GT , 00.05 , 530.000 Some services can be reduced by 90 % . 
Some individual services can be reduced by 90 % , others can be reduced . Like manufacturing of fertilisers 105 , 00.05 , 56 , 000 GT , 00.05 , 58 , 000 or air transport . 
Or air transport is the room for improvement , much smaller overall . If we are optimistic , we may get a reduction of a factor 3 or maybe a factor 3 , or maybe even a factor 6 . 
But in the first three factors , we are now 26 of billion to . Maybe the very best 13 billion tons . And that &apos;s just not enough . 
Let &apos;s look at the fourth factor . And this one is going to be a key factor . That &apos;s the amount of CO2 that &apos;s per unit of energy . 
It &apos;s emitted . It &apos;s the question of whether you can do that to zero . 
If you burn coal , no , 
if you burn natural gas , no , 
almost every method of producing electricity emits . Today , CO2 , except renewable energy and nuclear energy . 
So what we do on a global scale has to be a new system to 
create . We need energy under . 
If I &apos;m going to use the term &quot; miracle , &quot; I don &apos;t mean the impossible , 
the microprocessor is . A miracle , the PC is a miracle , 
the Internet and its services are a miracle . 
People here have a miracle to develop many of these miracles . 
Normally , there &apos;s no deadline for you to do a miracle up to a certain date . 
Normally , you &apos;re just standing next to it . And some come not . In 
this case , we have to give full gas . And a miracle in very short time will get . 
Well , I wondered , how can I really do that ? 
Transfers : Is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that shows the idea of people here ? 
I remembered the last year . When I brought mosquitos , and I kind of liked that . 
The idea became for them really tangible . You know , it &apos;s people who have mosquitos . 
There are people who have mosquitos . Energy fell . I got this one . 
I decided that releasing mosquitoes of fireflies would be my contribution this year to the environment here . 
Here are a couple of natural fireflies . 
You &apos;ve assured me that they &apos;re not biting . In fact , they &apos;re not even going to leave the glass . 
Well , there &apos;s all kinds of game solutions like this . But they bring none of them much . 
We need solutions , either one or more , that make an unimaginable scale and unimaginable reliability . And though there are many directions , where people are looking for it , I really only see five that are these big challenges that can make . 
I have tides , geothermal fusion and biofuels omitted . 
They may make a moderate contribution . And if they do better than I expect , that would be great . But my key message here is that we &apos;re working on all those five . And we can &apos;t do any of them because they intimidate us . Because everybody has significant problems . 
Let &apos;s first look at them . Burning fossil fuels is burning . Burning either coal or natural gas . 
What you do there seems to be easy . But that &apos;s not it . You &apos;d have to take all the CO2 that comes out of the chimney after you burn it . Pressure liquefaction . And then somewhere , store and hope it &apos;s there . 
There are some pilot projects that do this on a 60 / 80 level . But it &apos;s 100 to get it , very difficult . And reaching an agreement on storing the CO2 , and reaching an agreement on storing it , is a big challenge . But the biggest problem here is the question of storing time . 
Who &apos;s going to make sure ? 
Who can guarantee something ? What literally many billions times larger than any kind of waste ? You get away from nuclear and nuclear and other things you 
can imagine . This is a lot of volume . 
This is a hard nut . 
Next , nuclear energy . 
It also has three major problems . The cost , especially in highly regulated countries , is high . The question of security is that you really feel that nothing goes wrong . Despite human cooperation , that the fuel is not for weapons , the fuel is not used . 
And what do you do then ? With the waste . 
Because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concern . People have to worry about it well . 
184.00 , 10 , 20,000 GT , 00 , 10 , 25,000 . 
So three very difficult problems that might be solvable , three of them very difficult problems , which might be solvable . And those that make you work on that should be 
the last three of the five . So I summarized . 
These are renewable energy . As you often call them , 
and also they have , although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel . They have some disadvantages . 
One is that energy density is the energy density that these technologies generate dramatically lower than that of power plants . 
These are low @-@ energy energy . You talk about many square kilometers , thousands of times more space than a normal power plant . And 
also , these sources are subject to interruptions . 
The sun doesn &apos;t shine all day long . It also doesn &apos;t shine every day . And the same way , the wind doesn &apos;t blow all the time . 
So you have to , if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , have a way to have the energy even in times . If you don &apos;t have it available to get it . 
There &apos;s so a lot of price challenges here . There are challenges in transmission . If , for example , we say that the energy source is outside the country , you don &apos;t just need the technology . You also need to be able to deal with the risk that the energy comes from where it comes from . 
And there &apos;s the storage problem . 
And to scale this up , I have been all sorts of different batteries that are manufactured , looking at those that are for cars , computers , mobile phones , flashlights for everything . And that &apos;s what I &apos;ve got with the amount of electronic energy that the world uses . I found out that all batteries that we now produce are less than 10 minutes of the total energy that 
we could store . We need to have a big breakthrough here , something that , by a factor of 100 , will be better than the current approaches . 
That &apos;s not impossible . But it &apos;s not that easy . 
That &apos;s what happens when you try to find these interrupted sources about , say , 20 , 30 percent of consumption . 
If you &apos;re 100 percent reliant on that , you need a tremendous wonder battery . 
Now , where are we going to go ? What is the right approach ? 
A Manhattan project . How do we get to the finish line ? 
What we need is a lot of companies working on it , hundreds 
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people . 
Many people will say , &quot; They &apos;re crazy . &quot; That &apos;s good . 
I think here in TED , I think there are many people who are already engaged in this . 
Bill Gross has several companies , including one called Esolar . The great solar thermal technologies have invested 
Vinod Khosla in dozens of companies . The great things are doing and interesting opportunities . And I &apos;m trying to support that . 
Nathan Myhrvold and I are funding a company that , surprisingly , might be pursuing the nuclear approach . 
There are some innovations in the nuclear field : Modular , liquid . 
The development has been very important in this industry some time ago . So it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are lying around . 
The Terrapower concept means that instead of a part of the uranium that you get one percent , the U235 . We decided the 99 to burn . The U238 . That 
&apos;s a pretty crazy idea . 
But actually , you had been talking about it for a long time . But you could never simulate sensibly whether it worked , if it worked . But since it became modern supercomputers , you can simulate it and see that yes , with the right approach to materials , it looks like the right way to work . 
And because you can burn these 99 , the cost profile is much better . In fact , 
you burn the garbage , and you can even burn the garbage from today &apos;s reactors as 
a drive . Instead of talking about it , you burn it , you just burn it . A great thing : 
Uranium is gradually consumed , a little bit like a candle . 
You can see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often as a wandering wave called a reactor . 
That really solves . The fuel 
problem here is a picture of a place in Kentucky . 
This is the waste that &apos;s 99 percent . You have the part of the burned today . You have taken it out . So it says , &quot; depleted uranium . 
&quot; That drives the U.S. to hundreds of hundreds of years . 
And if you buy ocean water cheap and easy to filter , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet &apos;s 
life . You know , there &apos;s still a lot of challenges . But it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that are being developed to move forward . 
Let &apos;s think about how we can measure our success 
. How should our testimony look ? 
Well , let &apos;s go to the goal we need to achieve . And then we talk about the intermediate step . 
Many talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 . 
It &apos;s really , really important that we get there , 
the remaining 20 percent are in poor countries , and the rest are still being produced , and there &apos;s still some agriculture . Hopefully , forest threats and cement will clean up by then . 
So to get this 80 percent , you need the developed world , including countries like China , to completely redesign their generation of electricity . 
The other note says , well , if we use zero emissions technology , if they &apos;re in all developed countries , and we use zero emissions technology , and we &apos;re on the way to getting them to the 
rest . That &apos;s super important . 
That &apos;s going to be a key element of this stuff . 
If we go back from there , how should 2020 be testimony ? 
It should be back to the two elements . 
We should be using the effectiveness measures to reduce the amount of money that we &apos;re doing . The less we &apos;re emitting , the less CO2 we &apos;re going to get . And so the temperature . 
But actually , this note is for things that we &apos;re doing , things that are not completely too much of a reduction . Just equal , or even a little less . Important , like the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs . 
These breakthroughs we need to track with full @-@ gas . And that &apos;s what we can measure in company numbers , pilot projects and regulatory changes . 
There are many great books on this topic . 
The Al Gore Book . We have a choice . And David McKay &apos;s Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air . They 
go it through and they actually create a framework in which this is widely discussed . Because we need support from all of the sides for this . 
There are a lot . There &apos;s a lot to come together . 
That &apos;s a wish . 
It &apos;s a very concrete wish that we invent this technology . 
If you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , let me . I could give the president a choice : A vaccine , and I love that . Or I could choose that wish . That is half the energy price . Without CO2 , it &apos;s invented . That desire is sewn . I , 
this one , has the greatest impact . 
If we want that , it &apos;s not possible to get that desire , the gap between long @-@ term and short @-@ term thinking . People get horrible between the United States and China , between poor and rich countries , and almost all of them live on that two billion . A lot worse . 
What do we have to do ? 
What measures do I appeal for ? 
We have to work for more research funding . 
If countries are in places like Koppenhagen , countries should not meet just through CO2 , 
they should talk about it . They should discuss this innovation strategy . And they would be shocked by the ridiculously low money that is being spent on these innovative approaches . 
We need market incentives . We need carbon taxes . CAP &amp; amp ; Trade , something that sends out a price signal . 
We need to spread the news . 
We need dialogue , more rational and complete , and also things that are being done by the government . 
It &apos;s an important wish . But I think we can fulfill it . 
Thank you very much . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . Thank you . 
Thank you . Thank you very much . Just to get a little better at understanding Terrapower . First of all , you can give us an idea of the scale of this investment . 
Bill Gates : To simulate on a supercomputer , you know . All the big scientists get what we did , you need to have just a few 10 million . And even if we can put our materials in a Russian reactor , to make sure that it &apos;s working properly . Is it just in the 100 million of the hard ones ? Step 
by step , building the first reactor is another billion to find . The regulations and the place where they actually are the first to build . 
Once the first is finished , when it &apos;s running as promised , then everything is all very clear . Because the profitability , the energy density , is so different from nuclear energy as we know it . 
CA : To get that right . That means deep into the ground . Almost like a vertical pillar of nuclear fuel . This spent uranium . And then the process starts at the top and continues working . Down . 
BG : Exactly . Today , you have to reconstruct the reactor . So there are many people and many controls that go wrong . This one thing , where you can open it and things in or out , you can do . This is not good . 
If you do , however , have very cheap fuel , you can refill it for 60 years . Think about a column that you can bury without the whole thing complexity . 
And it sits there and it burns for 60 years . And then it &apos;s done . 
CA : A nuclear reactor that itself is a solution to the garbage . 
BG : Yeah . Well , what about the garbage ? You can sit it . There &apos;s much less garbage . With this method , then take it and grab it in the way that &apos;s next reactor and burn it further . 
And we start by putting the garbage away from the existing garbage , which is in these cooling basins or dry tanks at reactors . That &apos;s our starting fuel . So that &apos;s 
what this reactors are like , which was a problem . What we &apos;re doing in our fill fill , and that &apos;s dramatically reducing the garbage volume . During this process , 
about , but while they &apos;re working with different people in the world on these possibilities . 
Where is the greatest interest ? So what really is going to happen ? 
BG : Well , we haven &apos;t yet focused on one place . And there &apos;s a lot of interesting disclosure rules for everything that nuclear is wearing in the name . There &apos;s a lot of interest and people in the company were in Russia , India , China . I was here and I was Minister of Energy and I talked about how this was going to fit the energy agenda . 
I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the French and Japanese have something in the direction of 
this . This is a variant of one thing . It was done . 
This is an important step forward . But it &apos;s like a fast reactor . And some countries have built this . So everybody who &apos;s building a fast reactor is a candidate for a candidate for our first one . 
CA : In your imagination , timeframe and probability , this really is what you want to create . 
BG : Well , we need one of these scalable , power generating things that is very cheap . We have 20 years to invent . And then 20 years to deploy . 
This is kind of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us , which we have to comply with . 
And you know , Terrapower , if everything goes well ? And that &apos;s a big one . Wish could be easy to hold . 
And fortunately , there are dozens of companies today . And we need hundreds that are the same . If their approaches work , the promotion for their pilots works . To do that , they can offer . 
And it would be best if it could be done by several , because then you could use a mix . Anyway , you 
need a solution . 
CA : Concerning the big , possible breakthroughs , this is the biggest thing you know . 
BG : An energy break is the most important thing . 
That would be without the environmental challenge , too . But the power is still there . More importantly , 
in the nuclear sector . Is there other innovative companies 
? You know , we know about their work not as well as these . But there are the modular methods . That &apos;s another approach . 
There &apos;s a liquid reactor type that &apos;s kind of difficult . But maybe the ones who say that about us . 
And so there are different ones . But the beauty of that is that a uranium molecule is a million times as much energy as a say , say , a carbon molecule . And so if you &apos;re dealing with the problems and the problems are mainly the radiation , the footprint and the footprint and the cost is playing the potential . So the impact on the country and other things , almost in one &apos;s own league . 
CA : If that doesn &apos;t work , what 
do we have to do then is take emergency measures to try and keep the Earth temperature stable ? 
BG : If you &apos;re in this situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;re eating too much . And just before a heart attack , what do you do ? You might need a heart surgery or something like that . 
There &apos;s a research that &apos;s going on called geoengineering , which is going to look at different techniques to delay warming , so we can 20 or 30 years longer to get us together . 
That &apos;s just an insurance method . 
You hope we can &apos;t need that . 
Some people say you should not even get to the insurance first to work because you can maybe be lazy , so you can eat , because you know you &apos;re eating , because you &apos;re going to save you from heart surgery . 
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart . If you look at the importance of this problem , you know . But there are now discourses in the geoengineering world about whether to do that at your disposal . If things get faster or if they get this innovation longer than we expect . 
CA : Climate skeptics , do you have one or two sentences for those to convince you ? 
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps . 
Those who have scientific arguments are very little , 
say they &apos;re , negative effects are there that are associated with clouds , to do with them . Things shift . 
There are very , very few things that they say at all , of which there is a chance in a million , to do that . 
The main problem here is , like with AIDS . 
You make the mistake . Now , and you pay a lot later . 
And that &apos;s why the idea is , now , if you can have all kinds of urgent problems investing in something you don &apos;t know what you have until later . And then , what &apos;s more , the investment is not so clear . In fact , the IPCC Report is not necessarily . The worst scenario . And there are people in the rich world who are in the IPCC looking at and saying , &quot; Okay . This is not a big drama . The 
fact is that this uncertainty gives us cause for concern . 
But my dream here is that if you want to make it economically and at the same time eliminate CO2 , then you &apos;ll also be told by the skeptics . Okay . It interests me not that it &apos;s not emitting CO2 . I wish almost that it did that . But I &apos;m probably going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . CA 
: And that would be your answer to Björn Lomborg &apos;s argument that if you were to spend all this time and energy to reduce CO2 problem , if you were to use it , you would have to do it . All the other goals . They &apos;re going to suffer from poverty reduction . The fight against malaria , and so on , so that it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources , money to invest , while it &apos;s better things , that we do , to invest . 
BG : Well , the actual spending on research , let &apos;s say the U.S. should be 10 billion a year more spending than it is today doing . That &apos;s not so dramatic . 
It should be other things . 
It should not be suffering . You come to big amounts of money . And here , sensible people can contradict . If you have something that &apos;s not economically sound and you try to finance it . For me , this is where most waste happens . It &apos;s 
unless you &apos;re very short on the eve of a cost breakthrough , and you only fund the learning curve . I think we should do more things that try to have the potential , much cheaper , much cheaper . 
If the swab you get is a very high energy price , you know ? Then you can only keep the rich up . 
I mean , each of us here could do five times as much for our energy , without spending our lifestyle on changing . For 
the lower two billion , but is it a disaster ? And 
even Lomborg thinks about 
his new mesh , is it ? Now , why is research no longer being discussed ? He 
&apos;s still being discussed because of his earlier stories with the skeptic camp . But he understood that this is one very lonely group , and he &apos;s been talking about it . And so he &apos;s 
now bringing the research argument . And that &apos;s a thought that I &apos;m thinking is appropriate , 
the research . It &apos;s just crazy , how little . It &apos;s supported by 
Bill . I think I speak for almost everybody . If I say , &quot; I really hope that your desire will come true . &quot; Thank you very much . 
BG : Thank you . 
I would like to tell you something that I thought I &apos;d like to do a few months ago when I wrote an article for Italian Wired . 
I did write always my synonymous dictionary ready for use . But I was with editing the dictionary . And I was done with editing the text , and I noticed I &apos;ve never been looking at it in my life . What the word hinders really means . I 
read you the entry 
&quot; disabled . &quot; Adjective : Curved . Helpless , useless . Destroyed . Deathed , mutilated . Wounded , prepared , paralyzed , separated . Keep away . Defeat , weakened , impotent , castrated , paralyzed . Gehandicapt , senil @ age @-@ weak , withdrawn , repaired , done . @ broken , borrowed , counted ( see also injured , useless and weak ) 
@ antonyme , healthy , strong . @ efficient 
I have this list with a friend read out loud and I had to laugh first . It worked so ridiculous . But I just came up and prepared and couldn &apos;t speak any more and had to stop reading and stop reading and gather myself first . After this invincible flood of words and the emotional shock that it causes . 
Of course , it was a fractured old synonym dictionary . I got just thinking that the word issue was pretty old , it had 
to be old . But actually , it was an issue on the early &apos; 80s . When I was just in primary school , and I started doing this , my self @-@ image outside of my family environment started to build and shape , including in relation to other children and the rest of the world . To me 
and God be thankful , I have been unable to have used a synonymous dictionary at the time , 
I would take this entry seriously . Would I have been born into a world that would have been like me , as a person whose lives are not in any way positive ? But today , I &apos;m going to vote for the opportunities and adventures I &apos;ve experienced . Famous . 
So I &apos;ve immediately been celebrating the online edition of 2009 , and I expected to be here a more appealing contribution . 
Here &apos;s the updated version . This entry , 
unfortunately , is not much better . 
In particular , the last two words shake me under Near Antonym . All right and healthy . But 
it &apos;s not just about the words . 
It &apos;s about what we &apos;re talking about people who we think about with these words , and they &apos;re not about what we &apos;re talking about . 
It &apos;s about values , the values that are in those words , and how we &apos;re building those values . 
Our language is influencing our thinking , and how we &apos;re shaping the world and the people around us . 
Many ancient societies , including Greeks , and Greeks and Romans , really believed that the world debate of a curse would be a powerful force , because what you &apos;re saying loud is also manifesting itself , and it &apos;s a powerful force . 
So what do we want ? Actually manifesting . A disabled person . People or a powerful person . People alone , 
already a human being , mindless to call a child , could be enough to limit them and to impose ideas on them . 
Would it not be more beautiful to open doors to them ? 
A human being who for me opens doors was my pediatrician . AM : A.I. DuPont Institute in Wilmington , Delaware . 
His name is Dr. Pizzutillo . An Italo @-@ American whose name , you can imagine . Most Americans , not correctly speaking , could not speak . So he was always Dr. P. 
called Dr. P. And Dr. P. always wore very colorful flies and was for the kids to work with , just 
like it was created . I found the time I was in this hospital that I spent , just great except for my physiotherapy . 
I had to do individual exercises , seemingly infinitely often , with these thick elastic bands in different colors . You know that . My leg muscles build up . And I have these bands hated more than anything else . I have hated them . I have cursed them . I have hated them . 
And imagine if I had my leg muscles already , as a kid of five , with Dr. P. And so this is how I try to stop these exercises . Natural , without success . 
And one day he has cursed me at one of my exercises . These exercises were just tiring and merciless . And he said to me , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young . Girl : You &apos;ll one day be one of these tapes tearing . 
And if you can do it , I &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot; 
That was , of course , just a simple trick by Dr. P. to do the exercises that I don &apos;t do , right ? With the prospect that the richest five @-@ year @-@ old girl in the hospital will be on the second floor . But he has actually made me do my daily exercise horror with new eyes , to see . So it has made a new and promising experience . 
And I wonder today how much I like his vision of me as a strong and powerful young . Girl : My self @-@ image has shaped , and I could imagine myself as one of nature &apos;s strong , powerful and atlethic people , to see myself as one of the most atlethic . 
This is just one example of many . How adults in power positions can imagine a child &apos;s imagination ? But how those 
already cited from the examples of synonymous dictionaries prove that our language doesn &apos;t give us any room to imagine something . What we all want would be it for each and every one of us to allow ourselves to be seen as powerful people . 
Our language lags behind social change . It &apos;s lagging behind social change , which in many cases has been triggered by technological change 
, from the medical point of view . From the perspective of course , you can say that my legs , laser surgery for visually impaired visually impaired , knee joints made of titanium and artificial hip joints for aging bodies , which allow people to really use all their possibilities and to transcend the limits that their natural destiny has set them , even develop , not to speak at all . Social networking platforms , enabling people to become their own identities , giving up their own way and giving them 
their own definition , thereby becoming global players , groups that are their own , choosing them . 
Perhaps , then , this technological shift is making it clearer . Because ever before , it &apos;s always been a different truth , which is that every person in society has something very special and very powerful to give and that the people in their ability to adapt . Our greatest plus is 
the human ability to adapt . That &apos;s an interesting story . Because people always keep asking me to ask me to tell how I can deal with adversity . And I &apos;m going to confess something to you : This sentence has . For me , never fit , and I &apos;ve always been very uncomfortable with the questions that I &apos;ve asked people about answering . And I think , gradually , I understand why . 
This sentence about how to deal with adversity lives from the idea that success or happiness is dependent on it . A challenge to master without being driven by the experience that it entails , As if my life is so successful . Because I have the potential traps of a life with a prosthesis , avoiding the possibility of falling . Or , whatever , people , with my disability , perceive me . 
But the truth is that we are changing . Of course , we are shaped by the challenge . Whether you &apos;re physically , emotionally or even both . 
And I &apos;m saying that &apos;s good . 
Distastements are not an obstacle that we need to curve to work with our lives better , to make 
it clear . Diversity is just part of our lives . 
And I tend to treat distress as my shadow . 
Sometimes I realize that it &apos;s very present . Sometimes it &apos;s hardly visible , but it &apos;s constantly on display with me . 
And I want to make absolutely no sense of the impact or severity of a human being &apos;s struggle . 
There are in life adversity and challenges . And they &apos;re all too real . And every person goes different about it . But the question is not whether we can deal with adversity clearly or not , but how we deal with it clearly . 
We &apos;re not just for that , therefore . People who we love before blows of fate save us from blows of fate , but also prepare them for it . All right . So , with that . Let &apos;s get it right . 
And we do our kids no favours . If we give them the feeling that they feel they don &apos;t adapt . 
You have to do two things . All right . Separate . One is the medical fact that amputees are amputee . And the other is social opinion about whether I &apos;m disabled . 
Or not . And to be honest , the only real and lasting disability is with the one thing I deal with , and it &apos;s that the world is constantly saying . It can connect me with these definitions . 
In our desire to make people protected , the people that care about us and to give them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis , or even a prognosis about quality of life that I think they need to expect . We need to be careful not to lay the foundation for someone actually being disabled . 
Maybe that &apos;s the current concept that &apos;s just looking at what &apos;s broken in a broken . And how we fix that for everybody , a bigger disability for everyone than pathology in the way that we fix it . 
If we want to avoid treating a human being holistically and not treat all of his forces and possibilities . And recognize , we create , in addition to the natural struggle that you may need to fight . 
Another disease . We degrade a human being who is responsible for our society , and we do 
so . So we have to talk beyond patology . We have to look at all areas of human potential , 
and we have to focus on all areas of human potential . Most importantly , however , it &apos;s that there &apos;s a gap between perception of our inadequacies and our great inventive spirit . 
A connection we should have : We should not devalue these challenging times or deny them . We should not try to avoid them . We should not try to avoid them , nor should we sweep them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about recognizing opportunities in adversity . 
It &apos;s perhaps more about making it clear to me that we are not necessarily overcoming adversity , but that we need to be open to it , embrace it . You in the head , to embrace it , to put a fight expression , and maybe even to dance with it . 
And maybe we can do adversity as something natural , coherent and useful to see and see and feel like this through your presence , no longer so burdened . In 
this year , we celebrate the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin . And when he was 150 years ago about evolution , he wrote about evolution , Darwin , in my eyes , has something very true in human character . 
I would say it that way , not the strongest of its kind survives , nor does it survive the smartest of its kind , but of the one that can best adapt to change . 
Conflicts are creating creativity , not just 
from Darwin &apos;s work . We know that the ability of man to survive and flourish is dependent on the struggle of the human mind . It &apos;s determined by conflict to change . 
So again , change and adaptation are the greatest abilities of man . 
And maybe we know only from which wood . We &apos;re carved when we &apos;re really tested . 
Maybe that &apos;s exactly the meaning of adversity . A perception of the ego , a sense of our own power . 
We can feel ourselves something like this . 
We can give adversity a new meaning that is about difficult times beyond difficult times . 
Maybe we can treat adversity as change . 
Adversity stands for change in the way we feel like we don &apos;t yet adapted . 
I think the greatest damage we do to ourselves is the greatest damage we believe we have done to ourselves to be normal . 
Let &apos;s face it , who &apos;s normal ? 
There &apos;s no normal . 
There &apos;s the usual , the typical , but not the normal , and would you have those poor , gray person ? Really get to know this if it really existed ? 
I think it &apos;s not . 
It would be great . If we could have this pattern of normality versus another of the possibilities or the strength around it , even another one , a little more dangerous . We could exchange . So we can exchange the forces of very many children . And to invite them to release their very special and valuable abilities into society , Anthropolgy 
has found that we humans are being driven by the members of our society to always demand one thing : To be useful and to contribute to it . 
There are indications that there are already Neanderthals who , 60,000 years ago , older people and people with severe physical problems , Worn with and worn with , and maybe because life experience in the struggle for survival of these people is valuable to society . 
They have these people not broken as broken and useless . They were seen as something special and valuable . 
A few years ago , I went to the city where I was growing up , in a food market . In that Red Zone in the northeast of Pennsylvania and I stood there in front of a cup of tomatoes . 
It was summer . And I had shorts on and 
I hear how a guy like this . Behind me says , &quot; Well , if that &apos;s not Aimee Mullins , 
and I turn around and see this older man . &quot; I had no idea who he is . 
And I said , &quot; Excuse me . Sir , do we know ? &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t get to remember you . &quot; And 
he said , &quot; Well , you &apos;re unlikely to be reminded of me . &quot; When 
I turned them to see them for the first time , I got them out of their mother &apos;s belly . &quot; 
Oh . So , the , &quot; 
and of course , it did , but click . 
That was Dr. Kean . A man I just made of narratives from my mother about this day , because I knew about this day , of course , very typical of my birthday , two weeks late 
, the doctor for prenatal diagnosis of my mother was on vacation . And so my parents knew the man , the man who gave me birth , not at all . 
And because I was born without a calf &apos;s legs . And my feet , after them , had directed themselves , and I just had a few toes on this one and a few toes . On the other foot , it was the carrier . This stranger had to get the bad news . 
He said to me , &quot; I had to tell your parents that you would never walk and never walk and never be so mobile . Like other kids , or you would never be an independent life , you could . And since then , they &apos;ve just punished me with lies . Really 
? Exceptional . I found that he &apos;s done newspaper clips of my entire childhood . Whether I was in a letter contest in the second grade , whether I was winning with the scouts at the scouts parade , Halloween , traveling with the scouts , whether I was on my scholarship or one of my sporting victories , and he used these clips to get his students to teach . Medical students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School . 
And he called this part of his course the X factor , the potential of human will . 
You can &apos;t do enough to stress how crucial this factor is to quality of life for a human being . 
And Dr. Kean continued . He said , &quot; I learned that when you don &apos;t keep on telling something else , children get to say something else . And even if they &apos;re just a little bit supported , if you kids themselves are left to leave , children can do a lot . Look . 
Dr. Kean has his thinking changed . 
He had understood that the medical diagnosis and how someone could do with it is 
two different things . And I too have my thinking in the course of time changed . If you can tell me at the age of 15 , if I had my prostheses against legs from meat and meat and bone , then I would have no second , I would have hesitated . 
I wanted to be normal at that time . 
If you would have asked me that today , I &apos;m not so sure . 
And that &apos;s what happened because I have something to do with my legs , not despite these experiences . 
And maybe this change could happen as well , because I &apos;ve been meeting so many people who have opened doors to me instead of meeting people who have restricted me or restricted me or maimed out an idea . 
Look . It really only takes one person to tell you . How you can manifest your forces . And you &apos;re through when 
you do it to someone to make their own inner forces activated . The human mind is so receptive . If you do that and for someone in a critical moment , a door opens . Then you &apos;re for these people a very good teacher . 
You bring them with you doors to themselves to 
open . The real meaning of the word educate is rooted in the word educe . It 
means creating something that in a word is the potential to tickle out , 
again , what potential do we want ? Because now , 
retrieve in the &apos; 60s , in Britain , a case study was done . Back then , high schools were 
transformed into schools . They call that streaming trials . In the United States , 
we call that tracking . Students are being trained for grades . 
And the A students are getting heavier orally than they are . The better teachers , etc . 
, they have a three @-@ month period of time , students with a sufficiently good grade . It was told to them they were aces that they were very smart . And after these three months , they really have written one . 
And of course , it breaks your heart to hear that the other way around , the one @-@ serer students were told . They were just enough . And 
the same was the case . After the three months , too . But only 
those who still live in the school were , apart from the students who were the school @-@ makers , the ones who were still in school . 
And that &apos;s really important . So this study was that teachers were not inaugurated . 
Teachers knew not that something was changed . 
They were just told that they were the ones who were in the room , and that they were the students with the grade enough . And the same way , they taught them something 
, and they treated the only real disability is a broken mind . A spirit that was broken has no hope anymore . It doesn &apos;t find anything beautiful anymore , it lacks . Our natural , childish curiosity and our innate ability to imagination . 
If we do , though , we can do the human mind to help to continue hoping for ourselves and other people to keep hoping for themselves and to find beautiful around themselves , to be curious and imaginative . Then we put our forces really positively . 
One : If a mind is talking about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new forms of existence . 
I want to start with a poem written by a Persian poet called Hafiz in the 14th century , called &quot; Hafiz . &quot; And from which my friend Jacques , Dembois , told me , and the poem is called &quot; The God Who Only Words Four Words . &quot; Every child knows God , not the God of the Name . Not the God of Forbitions , but the God Who Who Only Words Four . And these are repeated all the time . He always says , 
&quot; Come dance with me . &quot; &quot; Come dance with me . Thank you very much . &quot;
