Before a few years ago here at TED , Peter Skillman presented a design competition called &quot; The Marshmallow Challenge . 
&quot; The idea is pretty simple . Four teams have to get the widest possible freestanding structure with 20 spaghetti . CA : 1m tape . CA : 1m thread and a marshmallow build , 
the marshmallow has to go up there . 
And though it really is easy , it &apos;s actually right , really hard . Because it &apos;s pushing people very fast to work together . 
And so , I thought this was a really interesting idea . And I have it in a way that I turned into a design workshop . 
It was a huge success . 
It &apos;s been a success since then , I &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world . It &apos;s been with students , developers and architects , even CTOs , the Fortune 50 companies . And there &apos;s something about this , and there &apos;s something about this . What depth of impressions into nature is about the nature of collaboration . And I want to share some of these with you . 
Normally , the majority of people start themselves with regard to the task of orienting themselves . 
They talk about this . They think about how it will look . They &apos;re hanging around power . 
Then they invest in a little time in planning and organization . They sketch and lay spaghetti out of it . 
They invest in a lot of their time in assembling . They invest in constantly growing structures . 
And finally , And just before they don &apos;t spend any time , someone takes the Marshmallow . And they put it gently on top of the top . They take a step back and admire TA @-@ da . What they do , though , 
almost always happens is that the TA @-@ da becomes an UH @-@ Oh , because the weight of the marshmallow causes the whole thing to bend and collapse . 
It &apos;s a series of people there who have a lot more UH @-@ Oh moments than others . And under the worst are freshness . BWL graduates . 
They lie , they cheat . They &apos;re confused and they really produce very poor shapes . 
And of course , there are teams that have a lot more TA @-@ DA formations . And under the best are freshness . Graduates of the kindergarten . 
And that &apos;s pretty amazing , like we do . 
Peter told us , &quot; Not only do they produce the highest towers , but they also produce the most interesting structures of all . 
&quot; What they might ask you is , how does this come about ? Why ? What is the point of those ? 
And Peter tells no one . The children are investing time in them . Chef of Spaghetti GmbH at the company . 
They &apos;re not investing time in power struggles . 
It &apos;s there , however , another reason 
and that is that BWL students were trained , one of the right plans to find . 
OK . And he was then realized 
what he was going to do when they hit the Marshmallow on top of the line . They have no time left . And what happens ? 
It &apos;s a crisis . 
Sounds familiar . What ? What else 
do kindergarten kids do is they do with the Marshmallow and prototypes , and they build it . Successful prototypes , always with the Marshmallow at the top , so that they have multiple times the opportunity to build dilapidated prototypes to repair . 
Constructors recognize these kinds of collaboration , as the core of an iterative process . 
And with each attempt , the attempt is made to get the kids immediately feedback about what works . And what doesn &apos;t work like 
that is the prototyping performance . So , essentially , but let &apos;s see how different teams operate : 
The average for most is . For about a half @-@ inch of BWL students , half of them are lawyers doing something more , but not much . Kindergarten kids are better than adults , right ? Who is at the most successful architect 
and engineer ? To be lucky 
. 1m is that highest . 
What I saw is what I saw 
and why . Because they have triangles to understand and self @-@ reinforcing geometric patterns . The key to stable structures is 
to build CEOs , something is above average . But here &apos;s where it gets interesting . 
Set it in an executive administrator . Put it on the team , they get significantly better . 
It &apos;s incredible . It &apos;s incredible . You look around and you see . This team is going to win . You 
can do that prediction . Why is this going ? 
Because you have special skills in process monitoring . 
You run the process . You understand it and that 
team , the team that controls and focuses on work . You pay attention to the team &apos;s performance will significantly improve . 
Specialized skills and process skills and their combination will lead to success . 
If you have 10 teams that have typical procedures , you get . CA : 6 : Stable structures have 
, I tried something now exciting . 
I thought , let &apos;s bring the poker bet in the same way . 
So , I offered a $ 10,000 prize of software for the winners . 
What do you think happened ? Well , with these design students . 
What was that ? 
Result . That &apos;s what happened . It &apos;s not . A team had a stable structure . 
If anyone had a two @-@ inch @-@ tall construction , they would have won the prize home . 
They &apos;d wear it , so it &apos;s not interesting that high betting has a strong effect . 
We repeated these exercises with the same students . 
What do you think happened ? 
Well , now you understood the advantage of prototyping . 
So this is how the same bad team , one of the best , got out of the same bad team . 
You made the highest construction in the world , in the least time . 
It &apos;s like , there are profound lessons for us about nature of propulsion and success , 
and that &apos;s what we have . You may ask . Why would someone actually have to invest time ? Well , a Marshmallow challenge to 
create . The reason is , I help digital tools and processes create digital tools and processes to help teams . Cars , video games and visual effects to create . 
And what the Marshmallow Challenge does is it helps them create hidden assumptions . 
Because , frankly , every project has its own Marshmallow . The challenge is to 
create a shared experience . A shared language or attitude , the right prototype , 
to build . And this is the value of this experience , this simple experience , this simple exercise . 
And those of you who have it interest can challenge Marshmallow . COM 
: It &apos;s a blog where you can see how to make the Marshmallows , 
right ? It &apos;s a step @-@ by @-@ step guide there . 
You can find crazy examples from all over the world , like people . That system optimizes and refines . 
It &apos;s also world records . 
And the basals lesson , I think , is the construction , actually , a connecting sport . Is 
it requires that we all be able to put our senses on the task , and that we should optimally optimize our thinking , like our emotions and our actions in the challenge , the challenge ahead of us 
? And sometimes it &apos;s a small prototype of this experience . Everything that it takes us to get away from a UH @-@ Oh to a TA @-@ DA moment . 
And that can make a big difference . 
Thank you very much . 
Do we do it as if we have a machine here 
? A big machine . A cool TED @-@ like machine . And that &apos;s a time machine . 
And everybody in this room has to enter . And they can enter into the past . 
They can go into the future . They can &apos;t go into the here . And now they stay . 
And I ask myself , what do you choose because I &apos;m thinking about choosing my friends recently , often ? These questions were asked , and they wanted all of you to go into the past . 
I know not . They wanted to go into time . Before it was cars , or Twitter or America or America is looking 
for the superstar . I know not . 
I am convinced that you somehow , in nostalgia , in wishful thinking , are drawn . 
And that &apos;s what I understand . 
I am not part of it . That group needs me to say , &quot; 
I don &apos;t want to go back to the past , &quot; and that &apos;s not because I &apos;m an adventurer . It &apos;s because 
it &apos;s because opportunities on this planet are not going back . They &apos;re going forward . 
I want to go into this machine . And I want to go into the future . 
This is the greatest time , the greatest time it ever has on this planet . No matter what scale you &apos;re applying . Health , wealth . Mobility , opportunities , falling rates of disease . 
It was never before that time , like this . 
My great grandparents all died when they were 60 . 
My grandparents urged these numbers to be 70 . 
My parents are the 80 percent , the 80 percent , on their heels . 
There should be better , a nine . AM : At the beginning of my death . 
But it &apos;s not even a question of people like us . Because this is a bigger thing . 
Before 100 years ago , you 
think about it . This is a tremendous fact . 
And why is this so ? The 
smallpox , smallpox , has billions of people on this planet killed . 
They &apos;ve got demographics of the Earth on a way to reinvent the way it &apos;s not a war . The way that 
it &apos;s ever done it is gone . It &apos;s gone . 
We &apos;ve got to defeat it . Puff 
in the rich world : There are diseases that millions of us have in the world just a generation ago threatened . Hardly ever diphtheria is 
rubbing . Polio knows anything . 
Still , someone knows what that is . Vaccines 
, modern medicine . Our ability to reach billions of people . That &apos;s successes of the scientific method . 
And from my point of view , the scientific method is to try things out . Look . Whether it works , it changes . If it does not , it does one of the greatest achievements of humanity . 
That &apos;s what the good news is . 
Unfortunately , that &apos;s already the whole good news . Because it &apos;s a couple of other problems . And they &apos;ve been mentioned many times , 
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people in the world every day are hungry to go to bed . 
These numbers are rising , and they &apos;re rising very quickly . And that &apos;s embarrassing . 
And not only that . We have our imagination for this . We &apos;ve used this world to 
thoroughly devastate , drinking water . Urbare land , rainforests , oil . Gas . It &apos;s disappearing . And that &apos;s about to disappear . And if we look at it , not from this chaos , we disappear . 
The question is , can we do that ? I think I do . 
I think it &apos;s clear that it &apos;s food that we can produce . The billions of people who feed without that land on the land where they live , without rape . 
I think we can do this world with energy . We can power this world that doesn &apos;t destroy it at the same time . 
I think that &apos;s really what I think . And no . That &apos;s not wishful thinking . 
But that &apos;s what keeps me at night awake . One of the things that keeps me awake at night . We have scientific progress yet to date , so much needed as we have never before . 
And we &apos;ve also been unprecedented . We &apos;ve never been able to use it sensibly , as we do today , as we can . 
We are at the threshold of the amazing , amazing events on many fronts . And yet , I really think that we have hundreds of 300 years before the Enlightenment , back to go back to a time to find a time when we &apos;re fighting progress . In the time we talk about these things more vigorously , in more fronts than we have now . The 
people cover themselves in their own faith . And that &apos;s so tight that you can &apos;t liberate them , right 
? Not even the truth gets them , it gets rid . 
And hear them . Everybody has a right to their right to their own opinions , even a right to their opinion on progress . 
But you know what they &apos;re not entitled to ? 
They have no right to their right to their own . Facts , charges , they don &apos;t have . 
And I have a while taken . To do that , to figure out 
about a decade ago , I published an article about vaccines for The New Yorker , a little article . 
And I was amazed at resistance to resistance . It was resistance to what was happening at the end of the day , the most effective action in the health care sector in the history of humanity . 
I knew not what I was doing , I knew . So I did just what I was always doing . I wrote a paper , and I went on . 
And soon afterwards , I wrote an article about genetically modified organisms . Food that was the 
same thing , just bigger . The 
people played crazy . 
So I got mad about it as well . And I could not understand why I was able to think . That would be Frankenfood . Why ? They believed that molecules were going to be a particular molecule , rather than a random way of moving around , an attack on the territory of nature . 
But you know , I &apos;m doing what I &apos;m doing . I wrote the article . I did it . 
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist . 
We type , we type , we &apos;re rich . We go eat . That &apos;s okay . 
But this article did make me worry . And I could not figure out why . And finally , I found out . 
And that &apos;s because it &apos;s because these fanatics who mad me , they even didn &apos;t even be fanatics . 
That was prudent people . Educated people , decent people . 
They were exactly like the people , like the people in this room . 
And that brought me that mess up . 
But then I thought , &quot; You know what ? Be us honest . 
We are at a point where we &apos;ve reached a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we used to have . 
We talk in two ways about it . 
We talk in ironic terms . We talk about it with small quotes , about progress . Okay 
. For that there are reasons . And I think we know what we know why these are . 
We have that trust in institutions . We have trust in authority , and sometimes in science itself . And it &apos;s not a reason why this is not so . 
You can just have a few names . And the people are going to understand 
Chernobyl , Bhopal , Challenger , Vioxx , weapons of mass destruction , the 2000 US presidential election . I mean , 
you know , you can have your own list . 
It &apos;s questions and problems with it . People from those people we thought we were going to be right . Be right , so be skeptical . Imagine if you 
ask questions , &quot; Do you demand evidence ? &quot; &quot; Do you demand evidence ? 
&quot; Take evidence . Take it for granted . 
But now , if you get evidence , you have to accept that evidence . And in it we &apos;re not good . And I can do that from 
the reason I say that we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear . How do I live in an epidemic of fear that I &apos;ve never seen before ? And hopefully never again see . Before I go back 
about 12 years ago , a story was published . A terrible story , which is the autism epidemic with the measles , mumps and rubells , vaccine , was linked . 
Very scary , 
shocking , in a way . Studies were done to try to see if this was true , 
shoddy . Studies were to be done . This is a serious matter . 
The data came in . 
The data came in , from the United States . England , from Sweden , from Canada . And they were all the same . No correlation , no connection , no connection . 
It makes no difference . It makes no difference because we &apos;re at anecdotes , believe in anecdotes . We believe what we see , what we see , what we believe to see , what causes us to feel real . 
We believe not in a bundle of documents from a government clerk who tells us data , And I understand that . I think that &apos;s what we all do . 
But you know what ? That &apos;s 
the result of that was catastrophic , catastrophic . 
Because of that fact , the United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is falling . 
That &apos;s scandalous . And we should be ashamed . 
It &apos;s terrible . 
What is happening is that we &apos;re doing that ? 
Well , I understand that . That &apos;s what I do . 
Because did this have masers ? 
Has a single maser in the audience ? JE : Somebody at measles dying ? 
Is not happening very often . 
It &apos;s happening in this country at all . But 160 000 times on the country in the world . IM : Last year . 
IM : That &apos;s a lot of measles dead 20 per hour . 
But because that &apos;s not happening here , you can do it out of place . And people like Jenny McCarthy can do things and they can run around and they can get messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like Oprah . And Larry King live preach . And 
that can be done because they &apos;re causing and correlation and not connecting . 
They understand not that these things are the same to seem the same . But almost never , almost never , are the same . 
And that &apos;s something that we &apos;re learning to learn . And that &apos;s very fast . 
This guy was a hero . Jonas Salk . 
He liberated us from a guy who was one of the worst scourges in humanity : Don &apos;t 
fear , no pain , polio . Puff disappeared , the 
guy in the middle , not so much . 
He &apos;s called Paul Offit . 
He has just been with a couple of other people a rotavirus vaccine . 
He can do life of 400 lives , 500,000 children per person a year . In the developing world , saving 
pretty well . Not . 
Well , that &apos;s good . Apart from being Paul walking around and talking about vaccines and talking about vaccines , and saying , how valuable they are , and that people should just stop complaining . 
And that says , in fact , that &apos;s how he says . 
Paul is , therefore , a terrorist . 
If Paul is a public hearing , when he speaks , he cannot speak without armed guards . 
He gets calls to his home because the people tell him they like to tell him they know where his children are going to school . 
And why ? Because Paul is a vaccine . 
I need that not say . But vaccines are essential . 
Take them . Turn them back . Terrible diseases . And that &apos;s what &apos;s happening . 
We have in this country now , measles . 
And that &apos;s getting worse . And pretty soon , kids will be back to die . Because that &apos;s just one question . The numbers . 
And they will not just be on measles . 
What is the polio ? Take the polio . Why not ? 
A fellow militant of mine has given me a couple of weeks ago and said , &quot; She believes I &apos;m a little bit too shrill . 
Nobody has that ever before said it . 
You would tell your child not to polio your child . You wouldn &apos;t be 
fine at all . 
Why ? Because we don &apos;t have polio . And you know what ? 
We had in this country yesterday , no polio . 
Today , I don &apos;t know . Maybe it was this morning . Someone in Lagos , in an airplane , flying straight to the Los Angeles . IM IMPORTANT IS HIS OVER 
OHIO , AND IN A couple of hours , he lands . And rents a car . And he comes after Long Beach . And he gets one of these fantastic TED Dinner . Today evening , he &apos;s visiting , 
and he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s having a paralyzing disease . And we know that as well , not . Because that &apos;s how the world works . Now , 
that &apos;s the planet . This is the planet we live on . Do you not do it as if it 
&apos;s not ? We love it . We love it in lying . We love it . 
Do you have it all this morning ? Your vitamins took 
Echinacea . A little antioxidant that gives you a little jump to the jumps . 
I know that you do that . Because you did half of the Americans , that every day , do it . 
You take it . And you take alternative remedies . And it does not make any difference how often we find out that they &apos;re useless . 
The data shows that all the time . 
They evaporate their urine more . Do they do almost never . 
That &apos;s okay . You want to like 28 billion dollars for dark . Urine pays me . 
I totally agree with you . 
Dark . Urine dark . 
Why do we do that ? Why do we do that ? 
Well , I think I understand . We hate the pharmaceutical industry . 
We hate a drug industry too strong a government . We have no confidence in the system . 
And that should be what we should not . Our healthcare system is bad . 
It &apos;s cruel to millions of people . 
It &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and cold and soul @-@ deafening , even to us who afford it . 
We walk , therefore , away from it , and where do we go ? 
We walk in the arms of the placebo industry . 
That &apos;s great . I love the placebo industry . 
But you know , that &apos;s really a serious matter . Because that stuff is crap . And we give billions of dollars to do that . 
And I have all sorts of little props here , 
none of them . Gingko fraud . Echinacea fraud . Acai . There you know , I don &apos;t even know what that is . But we give billions of dollars to do that . It &apos;s fraud . 
And you know what ? If I do that , I scream at people shouting at me and saying , &quot; What cares you ? &quot; &quot; Let people , let &apos;s do what they want . &quot; So 
that &apos;s how they feel good . And 
you know what ? They have got wrong 
because it &apos;s not my mind whether it &apos;s the Health Minister . The Health Minister says , &quot; Hmm . &quot; I will continue to draw the evidence from my experts on mammography , or any cancer quack liver that can inject coffee into its patients . 
If you look at this path , you go where faith and magic provide evidence and science replace , you get to a place , where you can &apos;t be , where you want to be . 
You get to Thabo Mbeki , in South Africa . 
He brought 400 000 of his people around because he was on the insistence that red beds , garlic and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs , of which we know they &apos;re going to be the ones that can slow down the course of AIDS . 
Hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country worse than any other country of this disease plagued by it . 
Tell me , please do not tell me that these things do not have consequences . 
The people you have , you have , you always have . 
Well , the most brain @-@ free epidemic we are in right now is this absurd fight between the advocates of genetically modified food . And the bio @-@ elite . 
That &apos;s a stupid debate . They have to stop . 
It &apos;s a debate about words about words , metaphors . 
That &apos;s ideology , not science . 
Everything that we eat , every grain of rice . Everybody branch of parsley . Everybody &apos;s sprouts were made by people . 
You know , there was no mandarin in paradise . 
It was not Cantaloupe melons . It was not Christmas trees . We have that all done . 
We have it in the last few 11 000 years . 
And some of it worked and some of it didn &apos;t . 
We &apos;re got rid of what doesn &apos;t work . 
Now , we can do it more precisely . And of course , there are risks . But we can do something like vitamin A in rice , in rice . And that stuff can do to millions of people , millions of people , to prolong their lives . 
That &apos;s what they don &apos;t want to do . 
I have to say , I understand that . 
We reject genetically modified food . 
Why do we do that ? 
Well , what I hear all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture . We want no huge fields with huge fields with one thing . That &apos;s wrong . 
We want not to have companies live patenting . 
We want not to have companies seed @-@ owning . 
And you know what ? My answer to all of this is , 
yes . You have been right . Fix . Let &apos;s fix that . 
It &apos;s true . We have a huge food problem . But that &apos;s not science . 
That &apos;s what science has nothing to do with . 
It &apos;s right . Morality , patent crab . 
You know that the science is not a company . 
It &apos;s not a country . 
It &apos;s not even a idea . It &apos;s a process . 
It &apos;s a process . And sometimes it works . And sometimes it doesn &apos;t . But the idea that we &apos;re going to be unable to allow science to do its work , because we &apos;re afraid , is a real impasse . And it keeps millions of people in the flourishing world . 
AB : You know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to get 70 percent more food to grow . As in the moment , 70 percent of 
this investment in Africa in the last 30 years has 
been shameful , shameful . 
You need that . And we &apos;re giving it to you . 
And why genetically modified food ? 
We want people not to encourage this rotten stuff to eat . 
Maniok is something that is half a billion . People eat . 
It &apos;s about like a potato . 
It &apos;s just a bundle of calories . It &apos;s bad . 
It has no nutrients . It has no protein . And scientists are building all this right in there . 
And then you could get people to eat and would not eat blindly and become blind . 
They would not starve . And you know what ? 
That would be nice . It would not be Chez Panisse . But it would be nice . 
And everything that I did to say about this is , why do we fight this ? 
I mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why do we fight this ? 
Because we don &apos;t want to push genes around . 
It &apos;s not about genes being pushed around . It &apos;s not about chemicals . 
It &apos;s not about our ridiculous stuff , our passion for hormones . Our insistence on greater food , better food , unique food . 
It &apos;s about not being rice . Krispies . It &apos;s about people at life . And it &apos;s going to be high time to understand what that means . 
Because you know what ? 
If we do not do that , if we continue to do the same thing as we do before . Do we do it to something that we owe ourselves to , I don &apos;t think we want to be guilty of ? High @-@ tech colonialism . 
It &apos;s not any other description for the things that are happening here . 
It &apos;s selfish . It &apos;s ugly . It &apos;s our not worthy . And we have to really stop that . 
After this incredibly funny conversation , we want you , maybe , to say , &quot; Do you still want to be in ? &quot; These ridiculous time machine , and into the future , 
are going to be in any case . That &apos;s what I want to do anyway . 
In the moment , she &apos;s in the present . But we have a tremendous opportunity , 
right ? We can do this time machine on everything that we want . 
We can put it where we want it to move . And we &apos;re going to move it to where we want it to be . 
We need to have these conversations . And we need to think . But if we &apos;re going to go into the time machine and into the future , we &apos;re going to be happy to have done that . 
I know that we &apos;re able to do it . And as far as I &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something that the world needs now . 
Thank you . 
Thank you . Thank you . When Steve Lopez , columnist of the Los Angeles Times , One day through the streets in the center of Los Angeles , one day he heard a wonderful music . 
You came from a man , a African @-@ American , sympathetic , rough , homeless , who was playing on a violin , who had only two strings left . 
Many of you will hear the story . Because from Steves &apos; articles about this later on , a book that was filmed again , with Robert Downey Junior . When Steve Lopez and Jamie Foxx were filmed as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers , the contrabass player who was studying at the Juilliard Conservatory , and whose promising career tragically early on was ended by paranoid schizophrenia . 
Nathaniel left Juilliard , suffered a nervous breakdown , and 30 years later he lived as homeless on the streets of the Skid Row streets in the center of Los Angeles . 
I recommend you all to read Steve &apos;s book or to read the movie or watch it so that it not only makes you understand the wonderful connection that exists between these two men , but also how the music , this connection , helped to make . And how they eventually made the instrument was when this play of words is allowed . That helped Nathaniel away from the game , from the street . 
I met Mr. Ayers . IM YEAR 2008 , two years ago , in the Walt Disney Concert Hall . 
He had just had a demonstration of Beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony and four , and he came behind the stage to get to imagine myself . 
He spoke in a very cheerful way and sociable tone about the yo @-@ yo . MA : And Hillary Clinton and about how the Dodgers did it never in the baseball , world series , and how ? And that &apos;s all because of the insidious passage of the first violin last sentence of the Beethoven . Fourth Symphony : 
We came up with the theme of &quot; Speaking Music &quot; and a few days later , I got an email saying that it was Nathaniel who was in violin classes with me . 
I have to mention that Nathaniel is a medical treatment that Nathaniel refused , because he was already in the process of electric shocks . And with Thorazin and handcuffs , he was treated with trauma , a trauma that his entire life . 
Hunt him when he was persecuted as a result of that , he &apos;s now particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases . The ones are sometimes so bad that they can make him tear him apart . And he &apos;s disappearing for days in the streets of Skid Row wandering around . Always , this horror and the torment of his own mind is exposed to . 
And in exactly the same stage of excitement , Nathaniel was when we were at our first lesson in the Walt Walt Disney Concert Hall , when we started our first lesson . He had this miserable flickering in the way he saw it and he was totally lost . 
He spoke about invisible demons and invisible smoke and about how things like someone in sleep would poison him . 
I had a fear , not for me , but for fear that I would lose him , that he would be put in one of his states , and that I would give him his relationship with the violin . If I started talking about clay ladders and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy , 
that &apos;s what I think is going to happen . I started talking about just a few things . 
I played the first sentence of the Beethoven Violin Concerto . 
And as I played , I fell on the ground that in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes , a complete change was taking place . It was when 
it was under his control , under the influence of an invisible doctor . It was a chemical reaction , the catalyst of which was my game , 
and Nathaniel &apos;s maniac anger turned into understanding , into a calm curiosity and grace . 
And how through a miracle did a miracle , he took his violin and began to listen . Some excerpts of violin concerts to play and asked me to then play them to the end , and then I started playing them . Mendelssohn Chaikovsky , Sibelius . We started then , talking about music , 
and we started talking about music . We started from Bach to Beethoven , Brahms , Bruckner and all the other BS of Bartók to all the ESA @-@ Pekka Salonen . 
And I became aware that he was not only a cyclopedic encyclopedia of knowledge about music , but he was with it , also a close personal relationship , and 
he was very much in touch with it . He spoke about her with a little passion and a sense of understanding that I would otherwise only talk about my colleagues in the Philharmonic of Los Angeles . 
He was talking about playing music and about music and talking about music . It was from this paranoid , confused man who was just being thrown through the streets of Los Angeles , a kind of educated , excellent in Juilliard trained musician .

for Nathaniel . ) Does music mean mental health 
? Because the music allows it to give it its thoughts and delusions with the help of its imagination and creativity into something real . 
And so it escapes its tormenting torment , right ? 
I understood that exactly that is what the essence of art is . 
It &apos;s exactly . This is the reason why we &apos;re making music so that we can do something within ourselves that is deep inside of us all . Our feelings through our artistic lens , through our creativity , through our creation , can shape into reality . 
And the reality of that expression reaches us all , and moves , inspires and unites us . 
What Nathaniel was doing , brought him to music back to the world , to a community of friends , 
the redeeming power of music brought him back to a family of musicians . The ones who understood him , who recognized his talent and respected him . 
And I &apos;m always going to talk to Nathaniel . No matter whether in the Walt Disney Concert Hall or in the Skid Row , because he reminds me of why he reminds me why I became a musician . 
Thank you very much . 
Bruno Giussani : Thank you very much . Thank you . 
Robert Gupta , 
Robert Gupta . I want to play something that I shamefully , the cellist stolen . 
I hope you will forgive me . 
I am Jane McGonigal . I design computer games . 
I develop now since 10 years . And my goal for the next one decade is to do the same thing , make it as easy . The world in which reality is happening to save as it is in online games is 
to save . I have a plan for that . I want more people to convince , including all of you , more time playing with bigger and more amazing games , to spend . 
Right now , we spend three billion hours a week playing online . 
Some of you think maybe . That &apos;s a whole lot of time for games . 
Maybe something about too much time . If you think about how many problems we urgently have in the real world , how 
many problems we need to solve ? In fact , but my research at the Institute for the Future , according to my research , is exactly the opposite . 
Right ? Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough . To address the world &apos;s most pressing problems , three billion hours a week is not nearly enough . 
Indeed , I am convinced that if we do the next century , on this planet , we want to survive this time dramatically , and we need to increase it . 
I have calculated that the time needed is when 21 billion dollars a time spent playing . 
Per week , that &apos;s what it looks like . First , maybe a little bit absurd . So , I repeat , it &apos;s with it . It works . It can work if we can have problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , I think we have to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week by the end of the next decade . 
No . I mean , it &apos;s really serious . 
Why ? This 
picture describes quite exactly why . I think that games like this are so vital to the survival of the human species in the future . Seriously . 
This is a portrait of the photographer . Phil Toledano . 
He wanted to make the feelings of playing . So he has in front of the players a camera . 
This is one of the classic expressions . 
In playing when you don &apos;t play when you &apos;re a player , you may miss them . Some of the nuances in this picture . 
You can probably see this sense of urgency , some fear , but also extreme concentration , deeply deepened into solving the problem of solving a really difficult problem . 
If you &apos;re playing , you can see some nuances . Here &apos;s the upward @-@ drawn eyes . And the mouth is a sign of a optimism . The eyebrows show surprise . 
This is a player who is on the edge of what &apos;s called an epic victory . 
Oh , you know that ? OK . 
Great . So , we have some players here , 
an epic . Victory is an outcome that is so extraordinary positive . They didn &apos;t know before that it was possible at all . 
It was almost beyond imagination . And if you did it , you &apos;re shocked that you &apos;re actually going to be doing something like 
that . That &apos;s a epical victory . 
This player is standing on the verge of an epic victory . 
And this is it , what we &apos;re doing on millions of faces of problem solvers all over the world . If we &apos;re going to break the hurdles of the next century , face of those who face the odds of all odds on the verge of an epic victory . 
Well , unfortunately , we &apos;re seeing this face more in real life . If we &apos;re going to face difficult problems , 
I call it that in life . I &apos;m bad at face , and it &apos;s 
actually my face . See , yeah . OK . That &apos;s me . How I 
do that in life ? I &apos;m bad . Face makes . 
This is a graffiti in my life , my former home in Berkeley . California , where I live in my Ph.D. study to see why we do better in games than in real life . 
This is a problem . This is a problem that many players have . 
We think that in reality , we &apos;re not as good as in games . And 
I mean , not only less successful , although that &apos;s part of it . 
We &apos;re reaching into more games . 
I mean , good in connection with the motivation , something meaningful about doing . Inspired in collaboration with each other . 
When we &apos;re in a game world , I think many people in us think that we &apos;re in our best version , at any time and immediately , helpful , persistent . That problem of solving , trying to solve as long as necessary , after failure , again try it . 
And in the reality , when we fail , when we fail , when we encounter obstacles , we often feel different . We feel like we &apos;re overwhelmed . 
We feel like we &apos;re defeated . We feel like we &apos;re threatened . Maybe depressed , frustrated or cynical . 
These feelings have been never felt . If we play games in games , there are them , just don &apos;t exist . 
And that &apos;s it . That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to study as a PhD student . 
Why is it in games impossible to do thinking ? You could not just think 
anything could be done . How can we do that feeling out of the games into the reality ? 
So , I looked at games like World of Warcraft . This is what the ideal environment for community problem solving is . 
And I have some things to say . The epic victories in online worlds , as possible . 
So first , if you go into one of these online games , especially at World of Warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are ready to give you a world saving mission . And that immediately . 
But not only any mission , but also a mission that &apos;s perfect for your current level . In the game , 
right ? So , you can do that . 
You get never a task that you can &apos;t solve . 
But always on the edge of your skills , so you have to make an effort . 
But it &apos;s not unemployment that exists in World of Warcraft . You &apos;re not sitting around and you turn around demons . It &apos;s always quite targeted . There &apos;s something important to do . 
And it &apos;s kind of employees where 
you go , wherever you go . Hundreds of thousands of people who have collaborated with you to get your epic mission done . 
That &apos;s what we have in real life , not so easy . This feeling that , in a fingertip , employees are willing to be in some way , 
and there &apos;s this epic story . These inspiring stories , why do we &apos;re there ? And what we &apos;re doing is what we get , then we get this whole positive feedback . 
They have certainly been at level high and 1 strength . Or , one intelligence . 
This constant feedback gives you no idea what &apos;s true in life . 
If I do this stage , I have no one speaking , and one crazy idea , I don &apos;t have one . 20 crazy idea . 
I get 20 real life . This feedback , not . 
So , the problem of online collaboration worlds like World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying . Anytime , on the edge of an epic victory , that we prefer to stand all our time in these game worlds . 
They &apos;re just better than the world of reality . 
Until now , all the World of Warcraft players have in common . Five percent ( 93 million years ) spent virtual problems of virtual Azerbaijan . 
That &apos;s not necessarily something bad . 
It sounds like bad . 
But to do it , in context , I think , five percent ( 93 million years ago ) started . Our first primate ancestors , we started 
walking upright . The first upright primacy . 
So OK . So if we talk about how we &apos;re going to spend so much time playing games at the moment . Make this just sense . When do you get the time to look at the scale of the human development before you look at it ? What &apos;s extraordinary , 
but what &apos;s appropriate ? Because it &apos;s a turn out that we &apos;re going to , by going on playing games all the time , actually change that . What we as humans do as humans can do 
? We develop . We become too community . Thinking , heartfelt beings . 
That &apos;s the truth . That &apos;s what I believe . 
Look at it for a moment , these interesting statistics that were recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University . The average young person of today , in a country with a strong playing culture , spends . Ten thousand hours with online games , up to the age of 21 . 
So 10 000 . Hours is a very interesting number of times . From 2 reasons : 
First of all , for children in the United States . Ten 080 hours , the exact total time they spend in the school , from the time of fifth grade to the end of high school , If you never miss it , 
so we have here a complete parallel education path . On the young , just as young people learn what it means . A good player to be like being anything else , whatever they do in school , learning . 
And maybe you have some of them doing the new book of Malcolm Gladwell . Overflying skiers , so you know his theory of success . The theory of success , the 10 000 hours . You know , 
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science that if we spend 10,000 hours with laborious study of any subject , until we 21 years of age , we will master . That is , 
we will do so well in it . What &apos;s whatever you do , whatever you do , like the most important people in the world . 
So what we do here is what you have is a complete generation of young people who are master players . 
The big question is , what is that ? Exactly , are players masterfully good ? Because 
if we do that , we would have , kind of , never before , ever known human potential at our disposal . 
So many people have we at present in the world , the world , who have at least an hour a day playing online . 
This is our master players . 500 million people , who are exceptionally well placed in something . 
And in the next decade , we have another billion players , the extraordinary good at playing what is whatever . 
If you do it not yet heard it , 
the game industry has developed consoles . The energy saving and saving on mobile networks instead of broadband Internet . So players can play around the world , especially in India . China , Brazil , online games , you 
can expect an additional billion players . In the next decade . 
So this is the total of 1.5 billion players . 
So I have started to think about what it is , what it is , what we can do with these games . Here are the four things 
that are the four things I found . When I first came up with urgency optimism , 
OK , imagine this as extreme self @-@ motivation . 
In the face of urgency optimism , the desire to do something right away is to do something . A hurdle to overcome together with a hurdle , believing that we have a reasonable hope of success , 
Players believe always in believing that a epical victory is possible , and that it is possible always worth it to do it and try it right 
away , and players don &apos;t sit around . 
Players are masters . In spiders , poets , social networks . 
It &apos;s a lot of interesting research . The research shows that we people more like . After we &apos;ve been playing with them , even if they &apos;re evil at us . 
The reason for that is that it &apos;s a lot of trust that requires someone to play a game . 
We trust in someone to have time with us . We trust that the rules will be respected . We trust that we will have the same goal , and we will stay with them until the end of the game . 
So , this allows us to play together . This is the growth of ties , trust and interconnectedness as a result . 
This is what we &apos;re building stronger social relationships on : Happy 
productivity . Fantastic . 
You know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of warcraft player is 22 hours a week . So , as part @-@ time job . 
It &apos;s because , if we &apos;re playing , we &apos;re actually happier at it , hard working . When , if we relax or relax or do nothing , 
we know we &apos;re human @-@ being @-@ optimal . When we &apos;re hard , meaningful work done , 
and players are always ready to work hard . When they do the right job , 
and eventually , epic meaning , 
players love it , part of awe @-@ inspiring . Missions of planetary scale to become . 
Here &apos;s a background information to get this right . You know , you probably all know Wikipedia . That &apos;s the biggest Wiki in the world . That &apos;s the 
second largest Wiki in the world , with almost 80,000 entries . That &apos;s the World of Warcraft @ Wiki . 
Five . Millions of people . Use it every time . 
Monthly . They have more information about World World of Warcraft at the Internet , than they have about any other topic . In each other Wiki , the world , 
they create an epic story . 
They create an epic source of the knowledge about the World of War Craft . 
OK . That &apos;s what four superpowers are , which lead to a single result . Players are super powerful , hopeful individuals . 
It &apos;s people who believe that they &apos;re considered as individuals , the world can change . 
And that only problem is that the only problem is they believe . They can do virtual worlds change . But they can &apos;t do real worlds . 
That &apos;s the problem that I have to solve . 
Edward Castronova is a scientist . 
His work is awesome . 
He &apos;s studying why people have so much time , energy and money in online worlds . 
And he says , &quot; We &apos;re witnessing not less than no less mass emigration into virtual worlds and online gaming environments . &quot; 
And that of a economist . So this is logical . 
And he says , &quot; Not as I do . &quot; I develop games . I &apos;m something exuberant . 
So he says that makes actually , in fact , sense . Because players can play in online worlds more than they can in real life . 
They can do in games stronger social ties , than in real life , They get more feedback and rewards and rewards in games . As in real life , 
so he says it &apos;s currently , absolutely logical that players can do more time in real life in the virtual world than in real life . 
I agree with you first . That &apos;s logical . 
But it &apos;s definitely . No optimal situation . 
We have to start to build the real world into a game . 
My inspiration comes from a moment of events . That second 500 years ago . 
It &apos;s been these ancient cubes from sheep &apos;s cocks . 
You know , in front of these fantastic game econtrollers , there were sheep &apos;s cocks . 
And that was sort of the first of people @-@ made toys . And if you &apos;re going to work with the works of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus . You know , maybe you know that story ? The story about how and why and 
how games were invented , according to Herodotus , became . Games , more precisely craps in the kingdom of Lydia , invented during famine . 
It was alleged there was such a great famine that the king of Lydia was turning into a crazy idea that the king of Lydia was going to be . The 
people suffered the people , the people fought . 
It was a extreme situation . You needed a extreme solution . 
So they invented it according to Herodotus , the craps , and they agreed a national strategy . At one day , you would eat . At the next day , you would play . 
And they would play so much in the craps &apos; play . There , games so fascinating and so fascinating and satisfying , happy productivity surround us that they forget they would be , there &apos;s nothing to eat . 
And then , the next day , you would play . And then the next day , you would eat . 
And according to Herodotus , they survived 18 years of age . These famines , by living on a day , and on a day of playing the next . 
The same is what I think we &apos;re doing today . 
We &apos;re playing games to help the suffering of the real world , escape . We &apos;re playing games to help everything . We &apos;re playing games to escape from what &apos;s not working in the real world . Everything that &apos;s working in real life that &apos;s not satisfying . And we &apos;re catching up what we need . We &apos;re getting out of the games . 
But that has to be the end , not the end . 
That &apos;s the exciting thing . 
According to Herodotus , after 18 years , famine didn &apos;t get any better . So , the king decided one last cube game . 
She shared that kingdom in two : Halves . 
She played a cube game . And the winners were allowed to become an epic adventure . 
They left lydia and made themselves up on the search for the ultimate new home . They left just like that many people behind as they left food for survival . And they were looking for the rest for a neighborhood in the rest of which they could thrive . 
That sounds crazy , right ? 
But the latest DNA evidence shows that the Etruscans , who later became the Roman Empire , are the ones who made it . The same DNA as the ancient DNA as the old lydians . 
So that &apos;s why scientists recently came to the conclusion that herodotus , crazy story , is actually true . 
And geologists found evidence of a global cooling that was almost 20 years long , which is what famine could explain . 
So maybe this crazy story could be right . Maybe 
they have actually their people , through games , saved their people by 18 years of saving themselves in games , by escaping . And then this inspiration had , and so much about the stuff that we learned about playing with each other , that it saved the whole civilization . 
So , that &apos;s what 
we can . We play since 1994 Warcraft . 
That was the first strategy game in real time . The World of Warcraft series . 
That was before 16 years ago . 
It was 18 years of playing craps . We play craps for 16 years . 
I &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game . 
So , they sent half of their civilization to the search for the search for a new world . So , I &apos;m taking my 21 billion hours of play a week . We should be agreeing that 
the world is half of us , one hour a day , playing games . Until we reach the problems of the real 
world , we have solved them . I know you &apos;re going to ask . How do we solve problems of real world in games ? And 
that &apos;s exactly the question I asked my work . In the last few years at the Institute for the Future , 
we &apos;ve been dedicating this banner to our office in Palo Alto . It expresses it like we &apos;re putting the future to understand . 
We want not to try to see the future say beforehand 
what we want is the future . To create the future . 
We want to see the best possible outcome . And then people get empowered to empower this idea into reality . 
We put ourselves in epic victories . We give people the chance to give them the opportunity to reach it . 
I &apos;m going to show you three games very briefly that I designed to play to try and emulate people epic victories in their own future , in my own right . 
This is this world without oil . 
This game is from 2007 . 
It &apos;s a game online where it &apos;s a shortage of oil that you have to overcome . This is a 
game where oil shortages are invented . But we have enough content online to make it available to you to realistically , and you can live your real life . In fact , without oil , live . So if you &apos;re going to play , you say to us where you live . And then you get news movies in real time that show you how much oil costs you , what it doesn &apos;t exist . How food supplies are affected , 
how transport is affected , whether schools are closed . Whether it &apos;s riots . And you have to figure out how you can live your real life . If it &apos;s true and we &apos;re asking you to do that , blog videos or photos , stop . 
We have this game with a one hundred and 700 players in 2007 . And we have them since then , through the last three years , been with us . 
And I can tell you it &apos;s been a changing experience . 
Nobody wants to live his life because it &apos;s good for the environment . Or because it &apos;s good for us . 
But if you &apos;re in an epic adventure , and you &apos;re told , &quot; Get us going . &quot; That oil from . 
That &apos;s a fascinating adventure on the one hand . 
Find out what you &apos;re surviving like . The majority of our players have the ones in the game that we learned . Habits have kept in place , 
so we &apos;ve got to go for the next world saving game . A bigger , higher goal than the only oil shortage . 
We &apos;ve got the Superstruct game at the Institute for the Future , developed it . 
The starting point is to calculate a supercomputer that people only have to 23 years to go on the planet . 
This supercomputer is called Global Dismortality . Sensitization system , of course , 
the call to players to sign up . Do we have almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer film ? 
They know Jerry Bruckheimer movies , where it &apos;s the dream team . They have the astronaut , the scientist , the ex @-@ Sträfling , and only together can they save the world . 
But in our game , instead of just five people , instead of just saying , &quot; Everyone &apos;s on the dream team . &quot; And it &apos;s our job to do the future for energy , food , health , safety and the future of social justice , and it &apos;s a challenge to do it . Eight 
thousand players played this game . Eight weeks , 
They found 500 . Incredible . Creative solutions that they read about . If you &apos;re Google Superstruct and Google 
the last game , we &apos;ll take the third of March out . It &apos;s a game in collaboration with the community of the World Bank . 
If you do the game , you get from the World Bank the award of social transformers , 2010 graduation . 
We work with universities in all over Sub @-@ Saharan Africa and invite them to redesign socially , learn how to do it . 
We have a comic book on this . We have levels up for regional level understanding . Knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and ingenuity . 
I want to invite you all to play this game with young people to share . Everywhere on the planet , especially around the world , in developing areas that benefit from joining forces to create their own social ventures to make the world save . 
I come now to the end . 
I want to leave you with a question : 
What do you think is happening ? 
When I say , next , we have all these fantastic players . We have games that give us a picture of what we can do . But we have games that show us what we can do . But we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet . 
Well , I hope you agree that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a great deal of significance for change . 
We have these whole superpowers , happy productivity . The ability to have tight social networks , urgency optimism . And that desire for epiepiepical meaning . 
I hope really that we together together will play important games . To get on this planet another one century , 
we will have another century , and I hope you will play with me and design and play these games . 
If I go to the next decade , I &apos;m going to be looking forward to two things : That we can create any imaginable future , and that we can create all kinds of games . So I &apos;m going to say , let &apos;s play the world @-@ changing games . Let &apos;s start . 
Thank you . 
Since some time , I &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect . It may be strange that the world @-@ changing games are interested in this . It &apos;s not unless you look at it like me , as a deception that leads to something real . If somebody just gets stuck enough to believe in it , 
in other words , have sugar pills . In some studies , a measurable effect has shown the placebo effect , and only because it &apos;s the person who thinks what to do with it . It &apos;s a pharmaceutical or some kind of pain management . It &apos;s a pharmaceutical or some kind of pain management . For example , if the patient believes in it only firmly enough , there &apos;s a measurable effect in the body that &apos;s called the placebo effect . 
A deception is becoming something real , because somebody somebody like this perceives it so 
that we can also understand each other , and I want to give you a basic , very simple magic trick . 
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . That &apos;s a trick that &apos;s at least been around since the 1950s in every children &apos;s magic book . 
I myself have him from the CUB Scout Magic . The scout scout in the 1970s learned . 
I &apos;m going to teach him for you and then explain him . 
And then I &apos;m going to explain why I explain him . 
So , you see what happens . 
That knife , the knife you can study . My hand , the one you can study . 
I &apos;m going to just do that knife . In my fist , I &apos;m 
going to push my sleeves back . 
And around to make sure that nothing in my sleeves disappears or disappears from it , I &apos;m just going to make my wrist . Right here , 
squeeze on this way , you can . You can see that there &apos;s no time anything moving . As long as I can get impressions here , nothing can go into my sleeves or come out . 
And that goal , in fact , is very simple . 
I &apos;m going to open my hand . And hopefully , if everything goes well , that knife will go through my bare physical magnetism , and that &apos;s what 
I call it . It sits actually like this firmly on its place , that I can shake it without shaking it without the knife falling down , nothing moves 
into my sleeve , or comes out , no trickery . And it can do everything , 
TA @-@ DA . 
Now , this is a trick that I often use to try to teach small kids who are interested in magic . Because you can do it a lot about deception , because you can learn a lot about deception . If you &apos;re looking more closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick to do . 
I think many of you here probably know about this . This trick , it works . 
So here &apos;s how it works . 
I think that the knife is . In my hand . 
I say that I &apos;m going to close my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or comes out . And that &apos;s a lie . 
The reason why I &apos;m going to tie my wrist is because it &apos;s actually the secret of the illusion . 
In that moment , when I &apos;m going to shake my hand away from you so that you can see it moving from behind . It &apos;s this finger here , my index finger , just moving from where it was to a position where it was , stretched 
out like that . 
Great trick , because there &apos;s somebody sitting behind there who 
had no childhood . So he &apos;s in here , right ? 
And if I &apos;m turning around , the finger changes its position 
and now , you could talk about it . Why ? That &apos;s a deception . Why ? Why not realize that this is just three fingers down here to see . Because the mind and the way that you see information processing it , it doesn &apos;t count individually . One , two , three , but you see it as a group . 
But that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about here , actually , not at all . And then open up my hand , I open my hand . 
Of course , it &apos;s held there , but not by magnetism of my body , but by a trick , by my index finger , which is there now . 
And if I do my hand close , the same thing happens by turning back . By doing this motion , it &apos;s hidden that the finger moves back . 
I take this hand away . And here &apos;s the knife . 
This trick can be used to help your friends and neighbors do . Thank you . 
Now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ? 
Well , a year ago or so , I read a study that really really bypassed me , actually . 
I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher . And so that was for me , a really amazing thing . 
It has turned out to be this . If you &apos;re a placebo in the form of a white pill , where you &apos;re in the form . One aspirin tablet is that just a round of white . Pill that &apos;s a certain measurable effect . 
But if you &apos;re in shape in the shape in which you give placebo , for example , into a smaller pill . And these blue dyes and you color a letter on it is it actually measurable , more effective . And that , 
even though none of these are any pharmaceutical . It &apos;s just sugar pills . 
But one white pill is not a very good pill as good as a blue pill , 
which made me really freak out . 
It put itself up , however , that this hasn &apos;t all been done yet . 
If you put capsules , they &apos;re still more effective than tablets . Everybody &apos;s shape , 
a colored capsule , that &apos;s yellow at one end . And at the other side of red , it &apos;s better than a white capsule . 
Also , dosage plays a role . 
A pill twice . Every day , it &apos;s not as good as three pills . I can &apos;t get myself to the next exact statistics . Do I &apos;m sorry ? 
I &apos;m sorry . The 
key thing is that dosage also plays a role , 
and the shape plays a role . 
And if you look at the ultimate placebo effect , you have to go to the needle . 
Right ? A syringe with a ineffective one . A couple milliliters , an ineffective substance , you can give to a patient . 
That creates a very strong image . It &apos;s in the head . That &apos;s very , much stronger than a white pill . 
These are graphs that are really . I &apos;m going to give you another time . If we have a projector , 
the fact is that the fact is that the white pill isn &apos;t as good as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work so well . How a capsule that doesn &apos;t work so well as the one that &apos;s needle , 
and has none of it , has any really pharmaceutical property . It &apos;s just our faith in it , which is in us stronger impact . 
I wanted to know if I could take this idea for a magic trick . 
I take something that is obviously a deception . And I leave it real look . 
We know , of course , from that study , that you can grab a needle if it &apos;s going to go to the point . 
This is a 18 @-@ centimeter @-@ long needle . It &apos;s very , very sharp . And I &apos;m going to start by giving you a little bit of sterilizing . 
That &apos;s one really my flesh . It &apos;s not Damian &apos;s special . Breed meat . 
That &apos;s this : My skin . That &apos;s not a special effect from Hollywood . 
I &apos;m going to now put this needle in my skin and go through it and drive it until it &apos;s on the other side , leaving again . 
If you &apos;re getting bad when you &apos;re slightly powerless , if you &apos;re going to get sick . I have this . I have some friends . Last night in the hotel room , I showed this to some people I didn &apos;t know . And I have a woman , almost powerless , getting lost . 
I propose , therefore , that if you &apos;re getting sick quickly , look for the room to be in the hotel for the next 30 seconds . Or , you know what ? I &apos;m going to start the first delicate part back here . 
You can do it in a moment . You can see it also , if you want . 
So , it &apos;s so right here , where my meat starts . AM : At the bottom of my arm , I &apos;m just going to make a little bit of a break . Do 
I really sorry ? Do you do that crazy ? And now 
, just . A little bit through my skin . And on the other side , like this , out again . 
Now , we &apos;re actually in the same situation , which we &apos;re in with the knife trick . 
About , 
but now you can do my fingers don &apos;t count . Or 
... So , I &apos;m going to show you . That &apos;s one , two , three , four , five . 
Now , yeah , 
I know what people think . If you do see that , 
you say , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s probably not so stupid . &quot; And it goes through itself , the skin just to give us a few minutes to walk around . 
Now , then I &apos;ll tell you , I &apos;ll show you . 
How does that look like ? Pretty good . 
Yeah . I know . And the people in the back say , &quot; Okay . &quot; I have that not right . The 
people in the adjoining rooms come now in . Let &apos;s 
let me tell you from the nearby . That &apos;s 
really my skin . That &apos;s not a special effect from Hollywood . 
That &apos;s my flesh . And I can do that around . Do 
I &apos;m sorry if you &apos;re getting bad ? Look at it away . Look at it . Don &apos;t look at it . 
People in the back , or those who will see it on video at some point in the future , will say , Well , yes . That looks like a pretty good thing . Impressive . But if it &apos;s real , it would look like it . Here &apos;s a hole . And there &apos;s a hole if it was really real , it would bleed . Okay . 
Let &apos;s let me just add a little blood to you . 
Yeah , here it is . 
Normally it would be me now to take the needle out . 
I would take my arm out and clean it up and show you that there are no wounds there . 
But I think in this context , here and with the one intent to get out of a deception something real , I &apos;m going to make the needle just out there . And so , from the stage , 
we &apos;re going to go into the next few days , a few more times . 
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . Thank you very much . 
So I have a lot of experience in my life . 
I have only two loved . 
This first , that was more like a passionate affair . 
It was a beautiful one . Fish tasty . Good consistency , rich . A bestseller . On the menu . 
What a good fish , 
even better . It got better in aquaculture after aquaculture , supposedly the highest standards of sustainability . 
You could get yourself well at that . 
I had a good beauty with that beauty , a relationship over several months . 
One day , the boss of the company called and asked , did I start growing in an event , about the supposedly sustainability of 
the farm ? Of course , I said , 
&quot; Here was a company that was trying to solve what this unimaginable problem for our chefs has become . How do we keep fish on our menus ? 
In the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been living fishing the seas , fishing forests , barren beaten . 
It &apos;s hard to see the destruction overestimated . 
90 percent of the big fish , who we love , the tuna , the curative butte , the salmon , the swordfish . They &apos;re collapsed . 
It &apos;s almost nothing more left . 
So it &apos;s likely to be aquaculture or bad aquaculture . Fish growing . A part of our future . 
Many arguments . Against it , fish farming is polluting the environment . The majority of them , anyway . And they &apos;re inefficient . Take the tuna . A big disadvantage . 
It has a feed recovery of 15 percent to one . 
That means 15 pounds . Wild fish are needed to make you make a pound of farmed tuna , 
not taste very sustainable . 
Also , not very good . 
So here was finally a company , at last . The one that tried to get it right . 
I wanted to support them on 
the day before the event , I called the head of public relations for the company , 
and I was going to call them . 
I want to call him . Don Don said , &quot; Just to get the facts . Right ? &quot; &quot; You &apos;re famous for that . &quot; So far out there in the sea , you grow the environment so that you don &apos;t pollute . That 
&apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; We &apos;re so far out there that the waste from our fish is distributed , not concentrated . &quot; 
And then he added , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re basically a separate one . 
These feed recycling of 2.5 percent to one percent , &quot; he said , 
&quot; the best in the industry , 
2.5 percent to one , great , 2.5 percent . 
&quot; To one , what feeds ? You 
sustainable proteins , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Great , &quot; he said . &quot; I put up . 
&quot; And on that evening , I lay in bed and thought , &quot; What hell is hell ? Sustainable protein ? 
&quot; So he called me the next day , just before the event , Don . 
I said , &quot; Don , what , for example , are sustainable ? &quot; 
Proteins . He said , &quot; He doesn &apos;t know . &quot; He &apos;s going to ask . 
Now , I telephoned with a couple of people in the company . Nobody could tell me a proper answer . Until I finally got started talking to the leading biologist , 
let &apos;s call him the same . 
Don Don said , &quot; What about , for example , sustainable ? Proteins ? &quot; 
Well , he mentioned some algae . And some fishmeal . And then he said , &quot; Chicken pellets . &quot; 
I said , chicken pellets . He 
said , &quot; Yes . &quot; Feathers . Skin . Bone flour , remains dried and fed . 
I said , &quot; How much percent of your food is chicken in the 
assumption that maybe two percent ? 
&quot; Well , these are about 30 percent , &quot; he said . &quot; 
I said , don . &quot; &quot; What &apos;s sustainable about chicken ? Chicken to feed fish ? &quot; 
It was a long break in the world of leadership . And he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chicken on the planet . &quot; 
I loved myself , and I loved this fish . 
No . Not because I was a self @-@ righteous connoisseur and a good man . 
That &apos;s me . Even 
no . I have no , actually , of this fish I &apos;ve loved because I swear to God , &quot; The fish after this conversation , after having tasted chicken . 
&quot; This second fish . This is a different species of fish love story . 
It &apos;s the romantic species that is the species where you &apos;re ever better off your own fish , the better you know your fish . Learning to learn the fish , the more you love it . 
I have it first in a fish restaurant in southern Spain . 
A friend journalist had been with us for a long time talking about this fish . 
She has been kind of cupping us . 
He came up with the table with a bright one . Almost shimmering white color . 
The cook had him cooked . 
&quot; Stop twice . 
Amazing , he was still delicious . 
Who can buy a fish ? &quot; So good taste . After he tasted it after he was cooked . 
I can taste it . But this guy can &apos;t . 
Call it the guy . Miguel . In fact , he &apos;s called Miguel . 
And no . He has the fish not cooked . And he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way they do . And I &apos;m understanding it under it . 
He &apos;s a biologist at Veta La Palma . 
That &apos;s a fish rearing in which southwest corner of Spain . 
They &apos;re near the mouth of the river Guadalquivir , right 
up to the 1980s . They were the farm in the hands of Argentines . 
They grew meat cattle on what was in fact wetlands . 
They made this by making this by making the land drainage . 
They built these complicated sequences of this channel and they pushed them into water out of the country and out into the hands of Argentines . 
Now , they couldn &apos;t make it happen that didn &apos;t work economically 
and ecologically , it was a disaster . 
It brought about 90 percent of the birds around , which is what this place is , many birds . 
And so it happened in 1982 , when a Spanish company with environmental awareness bought the land . 
What did you do ? 
You did the river of water , the other way around . 
You did literally the lever , you put it around . 
Instead of the water pushing out , you used the channels . To do the water back in . 
You flooded the channels . 
You created a 11 000 acres of fish rearing , perch , sea ash , shrimp , eel . And in doing so , Miguel and his company have the ecological destruction completely reversed . 
The farm is incredible . 
I mean , you &apos;ve got something like this before . 
You &apos;re staring out at the horizon of one million miles . And everything that you see is all flooded canals . And these density , lush march . 
I was there in front of me , not long ago , with Miguel . 
He &apos;s a tremendous guy . Three parts : Charles Darwin and one part : A crocodile to kiss . 
Okay . There were us and we fought ourselves through the wetlands . And I chastise . And I sweat , I have mud to my knees . And Miguel keeps in peace . A biology lecture . 
Here &apos;s where he lifts a rare track . 
Now , he mentions mineral needs of phytoplankton . 
And here . Here &apos;s where he sees a pattern of bundles that will put him in the memory of Tanzanian giraffe . 
It &apos;s a little bit like Miguel , the majority of his career in Mikumi National Park in Africa , spent most of his career . 
I asked him , how did he go to a fish expert like this ? 
He said , &quot; Fish , I don &apos;t know about fish . 
I &apos;m a fish expert . I &apos;m an expert in relationships . And 
then he goes and falls and falls into more talk . &quot; Rare birds and more algae and strange aquatic plants and understand them . 
&quot; And don &apos;t get me wrong . That was really fascinating . You know , the biotic community , unplugged ? So , in the way 
it &apos;s great . But I was in love . 
And my head became weak over the way that boiled piece of delicious fish that I was eating on the eve . 
So I have him interrupted . I said , Miguel . How does it happen that your fish is so tasty ? He 
showed up the algae . 
I know boy , the algae of phytoplankton , the relationships . That &apos;s incredible . 
But what do you eat ? 
How is the recycling of feed ? Well 
, he goes , &quot; I tell you that it &apos;s such a rich system . It &apos;s that the fish eat what they eat in the wild , 
&quot; &quot; The vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton . &quot; That &apos;s it . That &apos;s what the fish feed . 
That system is like healthy . It &apos;s completely self @-@ explanatory . 
It &apos;s not food . 
The food is from a farm . It doesn &apos;t feed its animals . 
Later on the day I drove on this plot with Miguel Miguel around . And I asked him . I said , &quot; For a place that &apos;s so natural to seem different from any place that is on which I ever been , &quot; &quot; How do you measure success ? &quot; 
&quot; In the moment it was when it was like a film director demanding a stage change . 
&quot; And we bowed around the corner , and we offered ourselves a set of incredible sights : Thousands and thousands of pinkers , flamingos . A literally pinker carpet . So far as the eye can see . 
That &apos;s success . Said he . 
Look at her bellies . Pink . 
She &apos;s smuggling , slugging 
. I was totally confused . 
I said Miguel . &quot; Get away from your . Fish . 
&quot; Yeah . Said he . 
We lose 20 percent of our food . And fish eggs to birds . 
Now , last year , this was on this plot 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species . 
It &apos;s today the largest . And one of the most important private bird reserves in Europe has become . 
I said Miguel is a good bird . It &apos;s not a thriving bird . It &apos;s the last one to be made on a fish farm . He 
shook his head . No . 
He said , &quot; We &apos;re building extensively , not intensive . &quot; That &apos;s 
this : An ecological network . 
The flamingos eat the shrimps , 
the shrimps eat the phytoplankton , and they eat the shrimp . 
The closer the pinker the belly , the better the system . Okay 
. Let &apos;s let &apos;s think about that . A farm that has its animals not feeding . And a farm that has its success on the health of its predators , 
a fish rearing , but also a bird reserve . 
Oh , and by the way , these flamingos shouldn &apos;t even be there from the outset . 
They breed in a city 240 in a mile away , where the soil is better . For the nest maintenance 
every morning , they fly 240 kilometers to the farm , 
and every night they fly . They fly 240 kilometers back . 
They go to do that because they &apos;re looking at the white line that &apos;s yesterday on the A92 highway . 
In fact , seriously . 
I had a very kind of journey that penguins had imagined . So , I looked at Miguel . 
I said Miguel . &quot; Fly 240 kilometers to the 240 @-@ kilometer farm and fly them . Then 240 kilometers back . &quot; AM 
Evening , they do that for the kids . He looked at me when 
he looked at me as if I had just heard Whitney Houston quote a song . 
He said , &quot; No . They do that because that &apos;s because the food is better . &quot; 
I have not the skin of my lover &apos;s fish mentioned . The delicious was , and I like no skin of fish . I like it , not sucked . I like it , not crispy . 
It &apos;s this biting , charred taste . 
I cook almost never with it . And 
yet , when I put it in this restaurant in southern Spain , I tried it at all , it didn &apos;t taste for fish skin . 
It tasted sweet and pure when it was like you had a bite from the ocean . 
I mentioned that to Miguel . And he nodded . 
He said , &quot; The skin looks like a sponge . 
&quot; She &apos;s the last defense before you have anything in your body that comes in . 
She has got herself over the course of evolution to develop impurities to suck up . And 
then he added , &quot; But our water has no impurities . Okay 
. A farm that has its fish not feeding . A farm that has its success measured by success in the success of its predators . 
&quot; And then it got to me , when he says , &quot; A farm that has no impurities , it undermines enormous . &quot; Because that water , which is through that farm , comes from the river Guadalquivir in the river . 
It &apos;s a river that has all of these things to do with it , rivers that flow today tend to do with them , to lead them . Chemical pollutants , outflow of pesticides . 
And if it &apos;s going through the system , it &apos;s been fighting , and it &apos;s leaving , the water is cleaner than it &apos;s come in . 
That system is so healthy . It cleans the water , 
so it not only cleans a farm that &apos;s not feeding its animals . It &apos;s not just a farm that &apos;s successful at ensuring health in its predators , but it &apos;s a farm that literally has a water treatment plant . And not only for these fish , but also for you , and me . 
Because if that water flows out , it sinks in the Atlantic , 
a drop in the ocean . I know , but I take it . And that should be you , too . Because these love stories , romantic , whatever , are also revealing . 
You could say that they &apos;re a recipe , for which they &apos;re good food for the future . Whether we &apos;re eating perch or meat cattle , 
what we &apos;re going to need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , of one in which food is . In fact , taste good . 
But for many people , that &apos;s a little bit too radical . 
We &apos;re not realists . We enjoy . We &apos;re lovers . 
We love weekly markets . We love small family businesses . We talk about regional food . We eat organic . 
And when they claim that this is the stuff , the things that the future of good food insure . Is anyone somewhere on the rise and says , &quot; Hey guys , I love pink flamingos . &quot; But how are you going to make the world feed ? How 
are you going to feed the world ? 
Can I honestly be honest . 
I like these questions . Not . 
No . Not because we already have enough calories produced to make the world more than just to feed the world . 
A billion people are going to starve today . 
A billion . That &apos;s more than ever before . Because of stark inequalities in distribution , not the total production . 
Now , I like this question , not because it &apos;s the logic of our food system , the last 50 years of it . 
Feed grain . Feed it to vegetable fodder , pesticides , monocultures , chemicals , chicken to the Earth , fish . And the whole time , the whole agricultural industry has just asked . If we want more people to feed cheaper , how horrible can that be ? That 
was the reason . It was the justification . It was the business plan of the American agriculture . 
We should be calling it what it is . It was a liquidation business . It was a business that quickly became greener capital , which is exactly what this production was able to do . 
That &apos;s not a business . And it &apos;s not agriculture . 
Our grain chamber is now threatened , not because of decreasing supply , but because of decreasing resources , 
not by the latest Moravian and Tractor inventions , but by fertile land , not by pumps , but by fresh water , not by chainsaws , but by forests , not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea . They 
want to make the world feed 
. Let &apos;s take a start with the question . How are we going to feed ourselves 
or better ? How can we create conditions that are conducive to any community , to self @-@ feeding ? 
To do that , Look at it . Don &apos;t look at the agricultural industrial model for the future . 
It &apos;s really old . And it &apos;s done . 
Capital , chemistry and machines are in it . And it has never had anything really good to eat . 
Look at the way it &apos;s done , instead , the ecological model . 
That &apos;s the one that &apos;s on two billion years of work experience . Look at it , Miguel . 
Farmers like Miguel . Farmers like Miguel . 
Farms that don &apos;t have worlds . For themselves , farms are . The ones that restore . Instead of using up farms . The ones that grow extensively . Instead of just intensive farmers who don &apos;t just produce producers , but experts in relationships . 
Because they &apos;re the ones who are experts for taste , too . 
And if I really honestly am honest , they &apos;re a better cook . They &apos;re a better cook than I &apos;ll ever be , 
you know , that &apos;s right for me . Because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious . 
Thank you . 
I grew up with a lot of science fiction . 
In my school days , I drove with the bus to the school . Every day , an hour per way . And my 
nose stuck always in the same book , a science fiction book . That &apos;s my thoughts into other worlds that kidnapped me and narrated me in a narrative way , my deep @-@ seated ones . 
Insatiable curiosity satisfied . These curiosity showed up as well in the fact that whenever I was not in the world of school , I was always straying through the woods , wandering and sampling , frogs and snakes and beetles and pond water , bringing everything home . And under the microscope , 
I looked at , &quot; I was totally . I was enthusiastic about science . 
You know , it was always a question of trying to make the world understand and understand the boundaries of what is possible . 
And my love for science fiction is that it seemed like my environment was reflected . Because back then , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea , 
Jacques . Cousteau came to our living room with his fascinating shows , which we had animals and places and a world full of wonders , showing us animals and places before we never imagined we could have imagined . 
This has then probably got pretty good at that science fiction role . 
And I was an artist . 
I could draw . I could paint 
and I could paint , and because it &apos;s neither video games nor this saturation with computer @-@ generated movies , nor the whole visual language in the media landscape , I had to create the images in my head . 
That had to be what we all had at the time . If we were kids , we had to read a book , we took the author &apos;s description and projected it onto the screen in our heads . 
My reaction to that was drawing . And painting of aliens was aliens alien worlds , robots , spacecraft , and all of that became my math class , and 
I was constantly caught by the teacher , hiding behind the textbook . 
So , around , creativity had to sort of get out of it . 
And at the same time , something interesting happened . What struck me about Jacques Cousteaus was shows that I was fascinated by the idea of a totally unknown world . Here , on our planet , certainly , 
I would never ever have an alien world with an spaceship , I would never have . That seemed to me to be pretty unlikely . 
But here was a world that was me , actually , able to enter . Here , on Earth . And you know , it was just as fascinating and exotic . Like all of this . What I was always imagining was what I had imagined when I read these books . 
So , I decided when I was 15 , when I was a diver . 
That only problem with this was that I was in a small village in Canada , living in 1,000 kilometers from the nearest ocean , 1,000 miles away . 
Of this , I left myself not discouraged . 
I was annoyed by my father until he finally had a diving school in Buffalo , New York , just to find out on the other side of the border where we lived . 
I made my diving certificate in a pool that was in the middle of winter in YMCA in Buffalo , New York , the ocean . 
But I made a real ocean , I got . It was only two years later that I saw when we went to California , 
since we moved to California in the 40 years that have passed , I &apos;ve been around 3,000 hours underwater . 500 hours of that in submersible boats . 
And I &apos;ve learned that the only thing the deep sea world can do is to even in the flatter oceans , so rich in fascinating life as we really hardly ever imagined it . The imagination of 
nature knows no one boundaries . It &apos;s quite unlike our own imagination , our own miserable human imagination 
, to this day . I feel deepest awe for what I have to say on my dives . 
And my love of the ocean keeps on with the same intensity as ever . 
And ever since I was then , as an adult , a career , it was that filmmaking . 
That seemed to be the best way to make my inner urge to tell stories . With my need to take pictures , to combine them . 
When I was a kid , I was constantly drawing comic books . And so on . 
So , films were the way , pictures and stories were to merge . That fit together . 
Of course , the stories I was telling were the stories I chose from the science fiction field : Terminator , Aliens and Abyss . So 
at Abyss , I could share my preference for the underwater world . And that was diving with filmmaking . 
So , the way my two two passions intertwined . 
Something interesting happened at Abyss to get a narrative problem . In this movie , solving and solving this had to be the kind of liquid water system that we created , we attacked computer @-@ generated animation . CG : 
What &apos;s coming out of this was . The first computer @-@ generated soft surface figure ever to be in a movie . 
The film brought , though , no money . It was exactly what it just played , the cost of its production . But it was something fascinating that I noticed the audience around the world was like hypnotized , hypnotized by the magic of 
what it was . According to Arthur Clarke &apos;s law , we know that advanced technology and magic are . Not anymore from one another . 
They saw , then , something magical . 
And that was what I found incredibly exciting . 
And I thought , &quot; Wow . &quot; That has to be absolutely part of the film art . So 
, we went to Terminator 2 , my next movie , a lot further . 
Together with ILM , we created there the guy from liquid material , and we did it . The success was very much dependent on how this effect came about . 
And it worked . Again , we had something magical created . And the effect in the audience was the same . But there we have with the film already a little bit more money . 
We &apos;ve recorded from these two experiences , and from that two experiences , we &apos;ve achieved a whole new world . We &apos;ve achieved a whole new world of creativity for filmmakers . 
So , I started a company together with my good friend , Stan Winston , who has been a company at that time , the best make @-@ up and creature designer , called Digital Domain . 
The basic idea of this company was to start the phase of analog processes with optical printers , etc . , and jump over to digital productions and start doing it . 
And so we did , and we did , and we did . So for a while , 
we had a competitive advantage . But in the mid @-@ 1990s , we realized that we had a creative and character design , what we called the company , which we actually founded , we had moved too 
slowly . I had this piece of Avatar written , which is the bar in visual effects and visual computer @-@ generated effects across the board , to push it up to new heights with realistic human expressive characters made using CG . And the main characters were to put all CG and the world was going to be CG . 
But the bar pressed the bar pretty much back . And the people in my company , they told me that we were still not in the company for the time being , in a position to do that . 
So , I postponed that , and I did this other film about the big ship . 
That goes down to the studio , I did that as Romeo and Juliet on a ship , and I sold it . It became a love movie of epic proportions . It became a passionate 
movie , secretly . But did I actually want to become a real wreck ? The Titanic , descend 
. That &apos;s why I made the film . 
That &apos;s the truth . That studio knew that , but it didn &apos;t . I have it , 
but I convinced it by saying , &quot; We dive to the wreck . &quot; We film that real wreck . 
We &apos;re going to do it in the opening sequence of the film . 
That &apos;s enormous , important . It &apos;s a good trailer for the marketing . And 
I persuaded them to make an expedition to finance it . 
Sounds crazy . But that can be done back to the fact that your imagination , a reality , 
can create . We created then actually six months . Six months later , a reality where I became a reality in a Russian submersible , four kilometers below the surface of the North Atlantic , and I found the real Titanic through a bullet . This was 
not a movie . No HD . This was real . 
So , this has really bypassed me . 
And the preparations for this were enormous . We had to have cameras and headlights and everything else . 
And I fell on how much I noticed these deep @-@ sea dive gears resembling a space mission . 
Well , you were also high @-@ tech and needed extensive planning . 
You go up into this capsule , then you float into this dark , hostile environment , where no hope for hope of salvation exists . If you do not , you don &apos;t , 
and I thought to myself , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s the same as if I were in a science fiction movie . 
&quot; That &apos;s real cool . I 
was pretty obsessed with exploring . I was obsessed with deep sea . Anyway , 
of the part that was curious and science about it . It was all . It was adventure . It was curiosity . It was imagination . 
And it was a real experience that I had not had Hollywood to give me . 
Because , you know , I could get a creature for myself to imagine , and then we could create a visual effect . But I could get no idea what that was that I was outside the window , what I was going to see . 
And for some of the expeditions that followed , I &apos;ve got to see beings in thermal springs . And sometimes things that I still see before , things I &apos;d never seen before , sometimes things that nobody had ever seen before . And for those who have science to do at the time we saw it , none of the 
words found . That &apos;s what made me really wrong . And I wanted more . 
And so I met , then , a rather unusual decision 
after that success of Titanic , and I said , &quot; Okay . I want to do my main job as a filmmaker in Hollywood on ice and I &apos;m going to be full @-@ time researchers for a while . &quot; 
And then , we started these expeditions to plan . 
We showed up to Bismarck and we explored them with robotic vehicles . 
We returned to the wreck of the Titanic . 
We took little robots , which we built , that were a fiberglass cable . 
Our intention was to dive in and get inside of the ship and see what never before has been done . 
Nobody had ever had the inside of the wreck explored . You had another one , you had no means to do that . So they developed the necessary technology . 
So , there we are , and I &apos;m sitting on the deck of the Titanic in a submersible boat , and I see planks planking these boards quite similar here . And from those I know are those that once the band there played , you know . 
And I &apos;m flying with a little robot vehicle through the corridors of the ship . 
I &apos;m using it , actually , only . But my consciousness is within the body of the vehicle . 
It felt like it was like it was physically inside the vehicle wreck of the Titanic , 
you know ? That was the surreal form of a déjà vu that I &apos;ve ever experienced . Because before I was around one of the corners , I knew I &apos;d always know what was going to happen in the light cone of the vehicle . And since I &apos;ve been running over the movie set for months , when we shot the film . 
That set was actually a precise set copy of the blueprints of the ship . 
That was , then , a very strange experience . 
It made me this telepresence experience aware that you could have such robotic avatars . And so , your own consciousness in that vehicle , into that other form of existence , is able to move . 
It was really monstrous , profound , 
and maybe also a small view of the things that might be in some decades , maybe . If you could have cyborg bodies to do some research or other things , or do things . In all sorts of post @-@ human future scenarios that I think I can imagine as a science fiction fan . 
After these expeditions , we started doing what we were down there , what we had seen . Really , we were learning to appreciate . To learn , for example , these deep @-@ sea equals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . This is sort of alien . But here on Earth . 
They live with the help of chemosynthesis . 
They exist not in a species that is based on sunlight . How we do this 
? And so this is how you see animals right next to a 500 degrees Celsius water cloud living . And 
you can imagine that you can &apos;t imagine them surviving there . 
To the same time , I was also very interested in space science . That was again the science fiction influence . From my childhood 
and so it ended up landing at people . They were interested in space , and they were interested in space with NASA . And in NASA &apos;s expert council , they were sitting there planning real space missions . They were going to Russia , going through before the mission . That biomedical protocol , and everything about it and everything , then fly to the International Space Station and take our 3D camera systems . 
That was fascinating . 
But at the end of the day , it was that I was going to be a space scientist with us in the deep sea . 
I was going to take them and I &apos;m going to give them access to the world . And down there , astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were working on these extreme situations . I was going to take them to the sources so they could look around , take samples and test instruments and test them , and so on . 
We turned , though , documentaries . But actually science , more specifically space science . 
So , this is how the circle between my existence as a science fiction fan , then as a child , closed . And the implementation in the 
reality of this . In the course of this discovery journey , I learned a lot . 
I learned a lot about science . But I learned a lot about science , too . 
Now , think about leadership , I &apos;m sure a director must be able to be a leader , be a ship captain or something . I understood , but 
I didn &apos;t understand much about leadership . Before I started these expeditions , 
because I was on a certain point , I had to tell myself , what am I doing here ? 
Why are I doing this ? What &apos;s coming out of this ? These 
stupid movies bring us no more money . We play some games 
right now , the production costs , fame , no trace . 
Everybody thinks , I &apos;m between Titanic and Avatar . Walked away and would have somewhere else nails on a towel on my hand . 
AM Strand , celebrated . I &apos;ve all these movies , these documentary films for a very small audience . 
No fame . No honor . No money . What are you doing ? 
You &apos;re doing it around the task for the sake of the challenge and the ocean for the sake of the challenge , and the ocean is the most challenging environment that exists . You &apos;re doing it of exploratory space . And because of the strange connection that emerges when a little bit of a group of people , a team , forms . 
Because we have all of this with just 10 to 12 percent of people who have been doing continuous cooperation for years . Sometimes , we were two to three months in a row at sea . 
And in this community , you can see that the most important thing is respect , respect , that you have for each other , because you &apos;re done a task that you can &apos;t explain to anyone else . 
If you think about returning to land and saying , &quot; We had to do it . &quot; That fiberglass , the sound attenuation and the whole around it , the whole technology and the difficulties . That human power , if you look at sea , can be done , you can just not explain that to others . That &apos;s like the policemen or policemen or soldiers who do something in common , and they do . And you know they do not ever know how to explain it to anybody . 
Because that &apos;s where a connection is created , a mutual respect . 
When I was back , I came back to my next movie , Avatar , and I tried to apply the same leadership style , which is that you respect your team and in return deserve respect . And that 
made the dynamics really change . 
And there I was again with the same little team , and I was standing on unknown terrain . We turned Avatar with an innovative new technology , which it used to be , and it didn &apos;t exist before . 
It was incredibly exciting , 
it was a tremendous challenge . 
And we became , for a period of four and a half years , a real family . 
And so this changed my way of making films completely . 
It changed people who thought we were going to have these ocean properties , really good at doing . And on the planet Pandora transports this . For 
me , it was more of a principled way of doing my job . The real process of doing this is , as a result , changing . 
What can we do from all of this ? 
What lessons do we learn ? I think in 
the first place , the curiosity is . 
It &apos;s the most powerful human property . Our 
imagination is a force that is even a reality that creates a reality . 
And the respect for your team is more important than all laurels of this world to 
me come . Boy filmmakers , who say , &quot; Give me a advice on how I can do this kind of thing . &quot; 
And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t limit you . &quot; Even a . 
That &apos;s already getting other people for you . &quot; Do not do it for you . &quot; &quot; Self bet not against yourself . &quot; But take risks . Take risks for yourself . The 
NASA has this kind of favorite sentence : &quot; Failure is not an alternative . &quot; 
But in the arts and in the exploration , failure has to be an alternative . Because there , it guarantees a advance of trust , 
not an important undertaking , innovation . Demanded that , without risk , innovation be approached . 
You have to be ready . Such risks on 
your own . That &apos;s the idea that I thought to you with with on the way . Failure is quite a way of thinking . Fear . But is not one . Thank you . 
If I can tell you one thing today , it &apos;s not that the whole of the data that we consume is larger than the data that we consume , the sum of the pieces that you put in . And instead of doing that , instead of thinking about overloading information , I want you to think about how we use information in a way that creates patterns . And we do trends like this , which otherwise are not visible . 
So , what we see here is a typical death chart , by age , arranged . 
That program , which I &apos;m using here , is a little experiment . 
It &apos;s called Pivot . And what I do with Pivot is what I can do with Pivot after a certain cause of death . Say , accidents 
and instantly , I see a different pattern , which is coming out . 
And that &apos;s because in the middle , here , people are most active . And they &apos;re over here , most frail . 
We can have a step further out and sort out the data , then rearrange it , and see that circulatory diseases and cancer , the usual suspects , are not for everybody . 
If we now go further and look at age , we say 40 years or younger or younger . Look at the fact that accidents even become the main cause of accidents , which people worry about , 
and they should be . And who &apos;s going to go further , you see that this is particularly true for men . 
They recognize , therefore , that the reputation of information and data in this way is very much swimming . In a living information graph . 
And if we do this for raw data , why not ? Why not for content itself ? 
What we &apos;re doing here is , what we have the front covers . Everybody , every single Sports Illustrated , who has ever been printed . 
It &apos;s all here . It &apos;s all online . 
It &apos;s all online . You can test it after my talk in your rooms . 
With Pivot , you can dive into a decade . 
You can dive in , into , for a certain year . 
You can dive directly to , for a certain issue . 
If I &apos;m here to look , I see the athletes , who are in this issue , and the sports . 
I &apos;m a Lance Armstrong fan . So click on here what makes me feel like all the issues that I see Lance Armstrong mentions . 
Now , if I just look at a bigger picture , I could think , OK ? What ? If I look at everything with the theme of cycling , 
so I go to a step back and expand the issues of cycling . 
Now , I see Greg Lemon . 
And so this is how you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , more targeted , wider , more pure , zoom out . Then you look not for or surf . You don &apos;t just surf . 
You just do something that is actually a little different . 
It &apos;s something in between . And we think it changes the way that you do it , the way that information can be used . 
I want to use this idea now a little bit further , with something like what a little crazy is . 
What we &apos;re doing here is what we &apos;ve got every single wikipedia page taken , and put it on a little summary . 
The summary contains a short overview of it and a symbol of the area from which it &apos;s coming . 
I &apos;m just going to show you the top 500 of the most popular wikipedia pages . 
But even in this limited view , you can see a lot of things we can do . 
Immediately , we get an idea of the issues that are on Wikipedia at the most popular level . 
I &apos;m going to move on to the government issue . 
Now , after I &apos;ve elected government , I realize that the Wikipedia categories that are on the most cover are Time Magazines , people of the year . 
This is really important . Because this is a realization that is not in a single individual Wikipedia page . 
This is just too recognizable . If you want to go one step back and look at the whole thing , 
look at a particular one . This summaries can be summarized in my perspective on Time Magazines , then . People of the Year go in and everybody together sees . 
If I go all these people now , I realize that I see that the majority of them are government officials . Some of them come from science . Some of them come from even less business . Here &apos;s my boss . And one comes from economics . 
And interestingly , Bono is also a TED Prize winner . 
So you can now jump and jump and take a look at all the TED Prize winners . 
You can see we surf the web . That &apos;s the first time it &apos;s as if it &apos;s really a web , not just from side to side , but much more abstract . 
And so , I want to show you something else that a little surprise might be , actually . 
I &apos;m going to show you just the New York Times here , website . 
Pivot , this application . I want it not to be a browser . It &apos;s really not a browser . But you can do websites with it . And we bring these zoom technology to every single website , like this . 
I can , therefore , take a step back and go straight to a specific section . 
That &apos;s why it &apos;s important because you can only look through looking at websites in this way and look at them all over the Internet , and in the same way , look at them . 
I can , therefore , go back and zoom in into my course 
, in a certain time frame . Here &apos;s the state of play of the entire demonstration that I &apos;ve been holding up to this point . 
And I can sort of do everything I &apos;m doing today , what I &apos;ve seen . 
Again , bring back . And if I go back a step , and I go back and look at everything , I can rearrange my course . Maybe after my search past . Here &apos;s where I went looking for nepotistic . Here &apos;s Bing or here &apos;s looking for live labs Pivot . 
And from here , I can go into the page and go in and call it again . 
It &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s always coming in and used . And every time it does that , it makes the overall picture bigger than the sum of the data pieces . 
In the moment , in this world , we think that data is a curse . 
We talk about it . Curse of the abundance of information . 
We talk about drowning in information . 
What if we could get this situation going and turn the Internet around on its head and turn it on its head so that instead of always moving from one to the other , we start from many things to many things to many things . And by doing that , we can see patterns that would otherwise have been hidden . 
If we could do this , then it will be this data trap that we &apos;ve seen so far , maybe a new source of meaningful information . 
And instead of just just looking at information , instead of just moving around . 
We know from that . And if we know , then then we can maybe even even know wisdom from it . 
So that &apos;s what I stop . Thank you very much . 
Everybody talks today about the happiness of happiness . 
I have some people who have the number of books counting . They were published with happiness in the title over the last five years . And they gave up after about 40 , they gave up . And it was still a lot more . 
It &apos;s a huge wave of happiness interest in happiness among people who have been researching . 
It &apos;s very , very happy coaching . 
Everybody would like to see people happier . 
But despite all of this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps that it &apos;s kind of almost impossible to do . Sure . About happiness , thinking about happiness , 
and my talk today is mostly about these cognitive traps . 
That &apos;s true for laymen who are talking about their own happiness . And it &apos;s true for scientists who are thinking about happiness because the result is that we are just as confused as we are with everybody else . 
The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity . 
It represents a reluctance to admit complexity . It turns out that the word happiness is simply no longer a useful word , because we apply it to too many different things . 
I think it &apos;s a certain one meaning on which we apply it to , you know , limited it . But in the big picture , by and large , that &apos;s something that we need to give up . And we &apos;re going to take the complicated view . That &apos;s what well @-@ being is 
the second . Trap is a confusion of experience , and memory . In fact , it &apos;s between happiness , being happy . In his life and being happy , being happy about his life , or being happy with his life . 
And that &apos;s two very different , very different concepts . And they &apos;re both thrown together in the idea of happiness , in the idea of happiness . 
And the third is the concentration illusion . And that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that the fact is that we don &apos;t think about a circumstance . The well @-@ being affects without its meaning distorting . 
I mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive trap . 
It &apos;s just not a way . It &apos;s right to get it right . 
Now , I &apos;d like to talk to you about an example of someone who had a question and answer session . After a one of my lectures , which told a story , it was unclear . He said , he had a symphony heard . And it was absolutely magnificent music . And it was at the very end of the recording , there was a terrible , creeping sound . 
And then he added , &quot; Really , quite emotional . &quot; That &apos;s what all the experience ruined . 
But that had it not , which 
it ruined . The memories of the experience were . 
He had the experience . 
He had 20 minutes of wonderful music . 
They counted not because he had a great memory . The memory was ruined and the memory was ruined , everything that he had to keep to 
was . What we had really told is , what we were talking about ourselves and about other people is that we could think about ourselves . In the sense of two kinds of self . 
It &apos;s a living self that exists in the present , living in the present . And the present knows how capable it is of rebuilding the past . But in fact , only the present has 
it , it &apos;s the living self , the doctor instigates . It &apos;s the living self that the doctor instigates . You know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Is it hurting now ? &quot; When I ask you to touch you here . And 
then there &apos;s a reminder . And that reminiscent self is that reminiscent self that &apos;s withering and the story of our lives is maintained . And it &apos;s that that that &apos;s the doctor who speaks by telling the question . How did you feel in the last few 
days ? Or how was your journey to the Albania or something like that ? 
This is two very different units , very different . This living self . And this memory self . And the two to be confused is part of the unity of the term &quot; happiness . 
&quot; Now , the memory self is a storyteller . 
And that starts really with a real fundamental reaction to our response to our memories . It starts immediately . 
We tell not only stories . When we think about it , stories become stories , 
our memory tells us stories . That means what we &apos;re talking about from our experiences is what we &apos;re allowed to keep is a story . 
And let &apos;s not forget about it with an example . 
It &apos;s a old study . 
That &apos;s real patients , who are one of the patients who undergo a painful procedure . 
I &apos;m not going to go into detail . You know , it &apos;s no longer painful today . But you know , it was painful when this study was done in the 1990s . 
It became a request to do it every 60 seconds , every 60 seconds , about your pain . And 
here &apos;s two patients . That &apos;s your record . 
And you &apos;re asked , who of both has more suffered from both ? And 
that &apos;s a very simple one , 
really . Patient B has clearly more suffered from this . His intestinal reflection was longer , and every minute of pain . The patient A had had patient A , patient B and more . 
But now there are a different one . How much did you think these patients thought they suffered ? And 
here &apos;s a surprise . And 
the surprise is that patient B had a much worse condition of remembering 
the intestinal reflection . And because a very critical part of the story is how much they end . 
And no one of these stories is very edible or great . But one of them is this : Clearly . But one of them is clear . Worse than the other is , 
and the one that is worse was where where the pain was all about to end up at its peak . It &apos;s a bad story . 
Where do we know that ? 
Because we &apos;re going to look at these people for their spinal reflections , and much later on , how bad was the whole thing ? And 
they were a lot worse for A than for B than for B in memory . 
Now , that &apos;s a direct conflict between the survivor himself , and the remembering self , 
from the point of view of the survivor himself , B had a clearly worse time . 
Now , what you do with patient A is what you could do . And we have actually clinical experiments . And it &apos;s done . And it works . You could actually do the intestinal reflection of patient A by extending it simply by just putting the tube inside without having to attach too much to it . 
That &apos;s going to make it happen that the patient suffers . But only one little bit and a lot less than before . 
And if you do that a few minutes ago , you have a effect on the effect that the living self of patient A gets worse off . And you have a effect on the memory self of patient being patient A. A getting much better off . Because now , you have patient A , a better story about his experience , given . 
What makes himself a story ? 
And that &apos;s true of the stories that the memory tells us . And it &apos;s also true of patient A stories that we invent , which 
makes a story that is unique . Breaks , significant moments and ends . 
End is very , very important . And in this case , the dominant end was end . 
Now , the living self lives its life continuously . 
It has moments of experience , a moment after moment . 
And it &apos;s asking you , what happens to these moments ? 
And the answer is really simple : You &apos;re for ever lost . 
I mean , most moments of our lives . And I have that calculated . You know , the psychological present is considered to be about three seconds long . What does knowledge mean ? You know , it &apos;s about three hundred million of them in a life . In a month , there &apos;s about 600 , 000 . The majority of them leave no left with any trace . 
The majority of them will be completely ignored , by the memory self . 
And yet , they somehow get the impression that they count . They should count that what &apos;s going to happen during these moments of experience . Our lives are that 
it &apos;s the limited resource that we have to consume as we rely on this world . 
And how we use it would be seemingly important , right ? But that &apos;s not the story . That memory self keeps for us . 
So we have the memory self . And that living self . And it &apos;s really pretty different . 
The biggest difference between them is that they deal with time , right ? So 
from the perspective of the living . Even if they do a vacation , and they have a second week just as good , as the first one . Then it &apos;s the two @-@ week vacation twice as good as the one @-@ week vacation . So 
that &apos;s how it doesn &apos;t work at all . It &apos;s not working for the memory self , 
for the memory self , a two @-@ week holiday is hardly better than a one @-@ week holiday . Because there &apos;s no new memories added to that . 
They have the story , not changed . 
And on those terms , time is actually the critical variable , the critical variable , which distinguishes a memory self from a living self , has time . Very little influence on that story . 
Now , the memory self makes more than just remembering and remembering stories . 
It &apos;s actually the one . That decision makes , because if you make a patient who has a patient who , let &apos;s say , has two intestinal reflections with two different surgeons , and decides which to choose . Then it &apos;s the one who chooses who chooses the one who has the memory that &apos;s less bad . And that &apos;s the surgeon , the one who will be selected . 
That survivor himself has no voice , right ? In this election , actually , 
we don &apos;t choose between experiences . We choose between memories of experiences , 
right ? And even if we think about experiences in the future , we think about our future , usually not as experiences . 
We think about our future , about our foreseeable memories . 
And in fact , they can do that . You know , as a tyranny of remembering self . And you can do that remembering memento self . As one , think . That , so to speak . That living self is dragging through experience that is the living self , which is not needed . 
I have the impression that if , if we go on vacation , it &apos;s very often the case . That means we do vacation as much as possible at the service of the remembering self . 
And that &apos;s a little hard , to justify , I think . 
I mean , how much do we feed on our memories ? 
That &apos;s a one of the explanations that are used for dominating the remembering self . 
And if I talk about that , I think about a vacation that we &apos;re going to spend a few years ago in Antarctica , which is clearly the best vacation we &apos;ve ever had in Antarctica that I &apos;ve ever had . And I think relatively often about that in relation to how much time I think about other vacations , in relation to that . 
And I &apos;ve probably heard about my memories of these three @-@ week trips . I would say something like 25 minutes for about 25 minutes in the last four years . 
Drilled . Now , if I ever ever had the folder opened with the 600 images in it , I would have another hour spent . 
Now , these are three weeks . And that &apos;s at most . One and a half hours . 
There seems to be disagreement there . 
Now , I like a little extreme . You know , in that , how little appetite do I have for feeding memories ? But even if you have more of that , there &apos;s a real question . Why do we give memories so much weight in the lurch ? To the weight we give experiences . 
So I want me to tell you about a thought experiment . 
So , imagine your next vacation . You know that on the end of the vacation , all your images are destroyed . And you get a amnesty drug . So you get yourself an amnesty drug , so you don &apos;t remember anything . 
Now , you would have the same vacation . And if you had another vacation , you would have a different vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two kinds of self . And you have to think about how you &apos;re going to decide this conflict . And that &apos;s really , really not obvious at all . Because if you &apos;re going to be in the sense of time , you get an answer . And if you &apos;re in the sense of memory , you could think of another answer , you could get a different one . 
Why we &apos;re going to choose the vacations we choose is a problem that is facing us , with a choice of choice between the two species of self . 
Now , the two types of self are throwing two terms from happiness : 
It &apos;s actually two concepts of happiness , the ones we apply , one per self , one . 
They can , therefore , ask how happy is . That living self . 
And then they would ask , how happy are the moments of happiness in the life of the living self ? 
And they are all happiness for the moments . Is a pretty complicated process . 
Which are the emotions ? The ones that can be measured ? 
And by the way , we are now able to have a pretty good idea . From happiness of the living self to happiness over time . 
When you look after happiness of the remembering self , the happiness of the remembering self is a very different thing . 
That &apos;s not about how happy it is that a person lives . 
It &apos;s about how satisfied or how pleased it is . It &apos;s the person when that person is informed about his or her life , 
very different terms . 
Everybody who thinks about these terms doesn &apos;t differentiate is going to . The research into happiness is going to melt . And I belong to a lot of happiness researchers , about well @-@ being , who are researching happiness long masking long . On the very same way , the distinction between happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , 
happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness And the satisfaction of the memory self is in the last few years recognized . And now , you &apos;re trying to make the two measure separately . 
The Gallup Organization has a global organization survey of the number of people in the world , where more than half a million people have been asked questions . And what they &apos;re asking about their lives and their lives and their experiences . And it was other efforts that have been made in that direction . 
In the last few years , we &apos;ve started to think about happiness , the happiness of the two kinds of self . 
And the main lesson that we have , I think , learned is that they really really differ . 
They can know how satisfied someone is with their lives . And that teaches them really , really doesn &apos;t teach them much about how happy he lives his life . And vice versa , 
just to give you an idea of the correlation between them . The correlation is about five percent 
, which means that this means that if you meet someone , and you would meet them , you would tell them , &quot; Oh , his father is a two @-@ meter man . &quot; How much would you know about his height ? 
Well , you would know something about his size . But it &apos;s a lot of uncertainty . 
You have that much uncertainty . 
If I give you a message that someone has his life as eight on a scale of 10 , classified his life as eight . Have you got a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self ? 
The correlation is therefore low . 
We know something about what the correlation is about happiness self happiness . 
We know that money is very important , very important . Targets are very important . 
We know that happiness is mostly about happiness , being satisfied with people who we like , time to spend , time to people we like , 
right ? It &apos;s other pleasure . But that &apos;s dominant . 
If you &apos;re doing happiness , then , for the two kinds of self to maximize . Will you be at the end of the day doing very different things ? The conclusion from 
the conclusion of what I said here is that what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re really not supposed to imagine happiness as a substitute for well @-@ being . 
It &apos;s a complete different term , 
right ? Well , very briefly , another reason for that is that we don &apos;t really think about happiness is that we &apos;re not looking at the same things , right ? If we talk about life , we think about life , and if we actually live . 
If you think about simple questions , then , how happy are people in California ? Will they be , will they not be given the right answer ? 
If they are asking that question , do they think that people in California are happier ? If they say , &quot; We &apos;re living in Ohio , 
and what &apos;s happened is that if they &apos;re talking about life in California , think about life difference between life in California and other places . &quot; And this difference is , say , in climate . 
Now , it turns out that it &apos;s climate not very important for climate to the living self . And it &apos;s not even very important , even for the thoughtful self . That &apos;s what determines how happy people are , 
but now , because the thoughtful self is responsible . Can you be ultimately some people who might be able to end up moving to California ? 
And it &apos;s kind of interesting to track . What happens to people who are looking for California , in the hope of being happier ? 
Well , their self @-@ living is not going to be happier . 
We know that . 
But one thing is going to happen . You &apos;re going to think you &apos;re happier . Because if you talk about that , you &apos;re reminded that you &apos;re terrible about the weather in Ohio , Ohio . And you &apos;re going to feel you &apos;re the right choice . 
It &apos;s very difficult , clear about well @-@ being . And I hope I have to tell you an idea of that , how difficult it is . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question for you . 
Thank you . 
Well , when we started thinking a few weeks ago , when we were talking to you , you told me that it was a pretty interesting result that came from this Gallup survey , 
is that something that you &apos;re able to share with us , because you &apos;re now left a few minutes . 
Daniel Kahneman : Sure . 
I think that the most interesting result we have in the Gallup survey is the one we found in the number that we absolutely don &apos;t find to be . 
We found that in terms of the number of happiness of the survivor . 
Even if we look at how we feel about the income of income , 
and it represents itself , it turns out that under an income of 60,000 dollars in a year , Americans . And that &apos;s a very large , large sample of Americans . About 600 000 . But it &apos;s a big representative . Under one income of 600 000 , 000 dollars a year . 
CA : 60,000 . 
DK : 60,000 , 
60,000 , 60,000 dollars . IM : Year is the unfortunate thing . And they &apos;re getting increasingly unhappy . JE : The poorer they get about 
that , we get an absolutely flat line . 
I mean , I rarely have that flat line seen . 
What happens is obviously that money is giving you no experience of happiness . But that lack of money gives you a certain amount of misery . And we can get this misery very , very clearly measured . 
In the sense of the other , even the remembering self , you get a different story . 
The more money you make , the more satisfied you are . 
That &apos;s not true of emotions . 
CA : But Danny , throughout the American endeavor , it &apos;s about life . Freedom , the aspiration for happiness . 
If people want to be serious about this finding , I mean , I mean . It seems like everything seems to be upside down . Everything that we believe to be , for example , in tax policy and so on , there 
is an opportunity that politicians , that the country in general , has a finding like taking seriously . And that &apos;s what politics would be based on . 
DK : You know ? I think that it &apos;s recognition . There &apos;s recognition for the role of gambling research in politics . 
The recognition is slowly going to be . In the United States , no question . But in the United Kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now . And in other countries , it &apos;s happening right now . The 
people are in the process of recognizing that they think of happiness . If you think about politics , 
it &apos;s going to take a while . And it &apos;s going to be people who will discuss whether they want to explore experience happiness , or whether they want to explore life assessment . So , we need to really have this discussion very soon , 
how to increase happiness . So , if you go in very different ways . Depending on that . How you think ? And whether you think about the memory self , or whether you think about the living self , or whether you think about the living self . 
That &apos;s what will influence politics , I think in the years to come , 
in the United States . Stricter enforcement is being imposed on the happiness of the people to experience . 
That &apos;s going to be , I think , in the next one or two decades , part of national statistics . 
CA : Well , it seems to me that this topic is going to , or should , at least be the most interesting political debate to follow . About the next few years . 
Thank you very much . For the invention of behavioral economics . 
Thank you . Danny Kahneman : Today 
I &apos;m speaking to you about energy and climate . 
And that &apos;s perhaps a surprise , because my full @-@ time job at the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds , about things that are the things that we invent and deliver , about the poorest two billion , about a better life . 
But energy and climate are extremely extreme , important . For these people , in fact , even more important than for any other person on the planet . 
Climate degradation means that their seeds are above all the seeds that will not grow for many years , we are too much or too little rain . The things will change that way . Their fragile nature will change as it cannot sustain . 
That leads to starvation . It leads to insecurity . It leads to unrest . 
So it becomes climate change terrible for them , you know . It &apos;s 
also the energy price for them that matters very much . 
The fact is , if you only talk about one thing , the price could be reduced to poverty reduction , energy would be energy . 
In fact , by far the most effective way , now the energy price has fallen over time . 
In fact , the progress society is based on energy progress . 
The coal evolution drove industrial revolution , the industrial revolution . And even in the 20th century , there was a rapid fall in the electricity price . And that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , air conditioning . We can use modern materials . And so many things we do . 
We &apos;re so in the state of affairs , wonderful with electricity , in the rich world . 
But if we do the price reduction , we let ourselves be reduced by half the price . Meet the price . Come across a new barrier . And these barrier hangs with CO2 , and 
CO2 warms up the planet and the equation , for CO2 , is . Actually , quite clear . 
You sum up . That emitted CO2 , which is used to increase temperature . And that temperature increase has some very negative consequences : Effects on the weather . And maybe worse , indirect effects , that the natural ecosystems are changing so rapidly , such rapid changes cannot be adapted . And so whole systems collapse . 
Now , exact connection between a single increase in CO2 and the resulting temperature change , and where they continue to follow . Because there are some ambiguities , but not very many . 
And there are certainly ambiguities about that , how bad these consequences will be . But they will be extremely bad . 
I have the top scientists asked several times , &quot; Do we really have to get down to near zero ? 
&quot; Is it not enough to half or a quarter ? 
The answer is , until we get near zero . Will the temperature keep rising ? That &apos;s 
why it &apos;s a big challenge . 
It &apos;s quite different from what it &apos;s to say . We have a three and a half feet truck that &apos;s under a three @-@ meter bridge . Come on , it &apos;s what you can do , squeeze it down below . That 
&apos;s what you have to do , down to zero . 
Now , we hit zero every year a lot of carbon dioxide , over 26 billion tons . 
Everybody in America , about 20 tons of people from poor countries , less than one on average , 
it &apos;s about five tons for everyone , on the planet . 
And somehow , we need to make changes that make this to zero . 
It &apos;s been constant up to 
now . Only different economic changes have made it even affect . And we need to be affected by rapid growth to reduction and to a reduction to a reduction to zero . 
These equations have four factors : One , a bit of multiplication . They have this thing on the left , CO2 , that they bring to zero . And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be done by the number of people , by the services that every human being uses on average , the average energy for every service , and the CO2 per unit of energy . 
Issuing is emitted . Let &apos;s let &apos;s emit every factor individually . And think about how we can do that to zero . 
Probably , a factor of these numbers has to be very close to . Zero comes . 
Now , that &apos;s basic algebra . But let &apos;s go ahead and go through it . 
First of all , we have the population . 
Today , six to eight billion people live 
, and it &apos;s going to reach nine billion , 
which is going to go to nine billion . If we &apos;re very successful in new vaccines , healthcare and new reproductive medicine . Could we do that , maybe by 10 to 15 percent ? But to date , we &apos;re seeing a climb of 1.3 percent . 
The second factor is the services . That includes 
all of the food , the food we eat , clothing , television , heating . 
That &apos;s very good things . And poverty reduction means these services almost to everybody on the planet accessible to everyone . 
It &apos;s great that these numbers are rising up 
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might think we could make cuts and use less . But in average , this number is going to increase every year , and so overall , it &apos;s more than doubling . The number of services that are available per person per person . 
Here &apos;s what we see is a very basic service . Is there a home light to light up so you can read the homework ? 
And these students have it not . So , they go out and read their homework under the school light . 
Now , effectiveness , the E , the energy per service gives you finally good news . 
We have something that &apos;s not going up . 
Because of different successes in the lighting sector , through other types of cars , through new building methods . It &apos;s got a lot of services that you &apos;re able to drastically reduce your energy consumption . 103 : 00 , 05 
: 50 , 000 GT , 00 : 05 , 53 : 000 . Some services leave you with 90 percent reduction . 
Some individual services leave you with 90 percent reduction , others with services . How do you make fertilizers 105 , 00 , 05 : 56 , 000 GT , 00 : 05 
, 58 , 000 or air transport ? Or air transport is the room for improvement , a lot smaller overall . If we &apos;re optimistic , we get maybe a reduction of maybe a factor three or three , or maybe even a factor six . 
But when it comes to the first three factors , we &apos;re now 26 billion . Maybe the very best 13 billion tons . And that &apos;s just not enough . Look at this . 
So let &apos;s look at the fourth factor . And this one will be a key factor . That &apos;s the amount of CO2 that &apos;s per unit of energy . 
It &apos;s emitted . It turns out the question is , is that you get this to zero ? 
If you get coal burning ? No , 
if you burn natural gas , no , 
almost every method of producing electricity emits . Nowadays , CO2 , except renewable energy , nuclear energy . 
So what we &apos;re doing on a global scale has to be a new system to 
create . We need energy under . 
If I &apos;m going to use the term &quot; wonder , &quot; I don &apos;t mean the impossible , 
the microprocessor is . A miracle , the PC is a miracle , 
the Internet and its services are a miracle 
, The people here have become the ones who have contributed to the development of many of these miracles . 
Normally , there are no deadline for you to do a miracle up to a certain date , 
Normally , you &apos;re just standing beside it . And some people come not . In 
this case , we have to do full gas . And a miracle in very short order of time . 
Now , I wondered , how can I do that ? 
Get over there is a natural illustration , a demonstration that shows the idea of the people here . 
I remembered . Last time last year . When I was bringing mosquitos and somehow liked the people , people liked that . 
The idea became for them really , really tangible . You know , it &apos;s human beings who have mosquitos living 
with mosquitos for energy . I did this , right ? 
I decided that this was the release of fireflies this year &apos;s contribution to the environment here , right ? 
This is where there are some natural fireflies . 
You have me assured me that they &apos;re not biting . In fact , they &apos;re not even going to leave the glass . 
Now , there are all kinds of game solutions like this . But they bring all of them not much . 
We need solutions , either one or more , which are an unimaginable scale and unimaginable reliability . And even though there are many directions in which people are going to look for it , I really see only five , which are able to meet these big demands . 
I have tides , geothermal fusion and biofuels omitted . 
These are perhaps doing a moderate contribution . And if you do better than you do , I expect that would be great . But my key message here is that we are working on all those five . And we can &apos;t do any of them because they give up because they intimidate us . Because everybody has significant problems . 
Look at them first . That &apos;s burning fossil fuels . Burning fossil fuels , burning either coal or natural gas . 
What you &apos;re doing there seems to be easy . But that &apos;s it . You &apos;d have to take all the CO2 that &apos;s coming out of the chimney after you burn it . Underneath pressure , liquefaction . And then somewhere , store and hope that it &apos;s there to stay . 
It &apos;s got some pilot projects that are doing this on a 60 @-@ 80 level . But it &apos;s 100 to get it , very difficult to get . And a deal for the storage of the CO2 to get agreement is to get a big challenge . But that &apos;s the biggest problem here , the question of storage time . 
Who &apos;s going to make sure ? 
Who can make sure ? Who can guarantee something ? What literally is many billion times bigger than any kind of waste you can imagine about nuclear and other things . 
That &apos;s a lot of volume . That &apos;s 
so , a hard nut . When I 
next came up with nuclear energy , 
it also has three major problems . The cost before all , especially in highly regulated countries , is high . The question of safety is that you really feel that nothing is wrong . Despite the human collaboration , that the fuel is not for weapons , that fuel is not used . 
And what does you do then ? With the waste ? 
Because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concern . The 
people have to worry about it well . 
184 : 00 10 20 000 GT 00 10 25 000 000 . So three , very difficult problems , which might be solvable , three , very difficult problems , which might be solvable . And at which you can work , therefore , 
the last three of the five have . I &apos;ll summarize . 
It &apos;s the renewables . How they &apos;re often called , 
and also the ones have , although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel . They have some disadvantages . 
So , first of all , the energy density that these technologies generate is dramatically lower than that of power plants . 
That &apos;s low @-@ energy . You talk about many square kilometers , thousands of times more space than a normal power plant . And 
also , these sources are interruptions . 
The sun shines not the whole thing day . They shines also not every day , not every day . And just as blows blows the wind , not all the time . 
So that &apos;s why , if you &apos;re from these sources , you have to have a way to use energy even in times . If you &apos;re not available , if it &apos;s not available , you get it . 
It &apos;s here , so there &apos;s big price challenges . It &apos;s there . There &apos;s challenges in transmission . If we , for example , say that the energy source outside the country is not , you don &apos;t just need technology . You need to also use the risk to run the energy risk from where else comes from . 
And it &apos;s there , the storage problem . 
And to do that , to show the dimension , I &apos;ve looked at all kinds of batteries that are manufactured , which are used for cars , computers , mobile phones , flashlights for everything . And that &apos;s what I did with the amount of electronic energy that the world uses , compared to the amount of electronic energy that it uses . I found out that all batteries are the batteries that we &apos;re now producing , less than 10 minutes of total energy storage . 
We need to have a big , big breakthrough here , something that &apos;s going to be 100 percent better than the approaches to the moment . 
That &apos;s not impossible . But it &apos;s not that easy . 
That &apos;s what happens when you try to find these interrupted sources about , say , We 20 , 30 percent of consumption , When 
you get around 100 percent of that , you need 100 percent incredible wonder battery . 
Now where are we going to go ? What is the right approach ? 
A Manhattan project . How do we get to the finish line ? 
What we need is a lot of companies that are working on it , hundreds 
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people . 
In many , they will say , &quot; They &apos;re crazy . &quot; That &apos;s good . 
I think here in the TED , I think there are a lot of people who are already engaged in this . 
Bill Gross has several companies under the leadership of , say , Esolar . The great solar thermal technologies have 
Vinod Khosla invested in dozens of companies . The great things are doing and interesting opportunities have . And I &apos;m trying to support that . 
Nathan Myhrvold and I are funding a company that might surprisingly , surprisingly , be pursuing a nuclear approach . 
It &apos;s got some innovations in the nuclear field : Modular , liquid . 
The development has been very successful in this industry some time ago . So , it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are lying around . 
That Terrapower concept means you &apos;re going to replace part of the uranium that you get one percent , the U235 . We decided to take the 99 to burn . That U238 . That 
&apos;s a pretty crazy idea . 
But actually , you had about it for a long time . But you could never make reasonable simulations of whether it would work . But since it became modern supercomputers , it &apos;s been possible to simulate it and see that yes , with the right approach to materials , it looks like it works . 
And because you can do these 99 burns , the cost profile is much better . In fact , 
you burn the garbage and you can even burn the garbage from today &apos;s reactors as 
a drive . Instead of getting over the head , breaking your head , they just burn it . A great thing , 
uranium is going to be used gradually , a little bit like a candle . 
You can see that it &apos;s kind of a column , often as a migratory wave called a reactor . 
That triggers really . That &apos;s the fuel problem . 
Here &apos;s a picture of a place in Kentucky . 
That &apos;s the waste that &apos;s 99 percent . You have the part of the waste that &apos;s burned today . You &apos;ve taken it out . So it says , &quot; depleted uranium . 
&quot; That drives the U.U. &apos; s for hundreds of years to come . 
And if you want to buy ocean water cheaply and simply filter , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet &apos;s 
life . You know , there &apos;s still a lot of challenges . But it &apos;s a case of example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward , to get ahead . 
Think about it , how do we make our success measured ? 
How should we make our testimony look ? 
Well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to achieve . And then talk to you about the intermediate step . 
A lot of people talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 . 
It &apos;s really , really important that we get there , 
the rest of the 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still something agriculture . Hopefully , forest threats and cement will be clean by then . 
So , to get this 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like China , needs to completely transform their generation of electricity . 
The other note says whether we can change zero emissions technology . Whether they &apos;re in all developed countries , whether they &apos;re in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to getting them to the 
rest . That &apos;s great . 
That &apos;s going to be a key element of this stuff . 
If we &apos;re from there , how should that go back in 2020 ? 
It should go back to the two elements . 
We should go back to using the effectiveness measures to get reduction down the road . The less we emit , the less we emit the CO2 will be . And so , too , will the temperature . 
But actually , this note is for the things that we do . The things that we don &apos;t do completely , which lead to the big reductions . Only the same , or even a little less . Important , like the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs . 
These breakthroughs need to be fully gas @-@ tracked . And that can be measured in the company numbers , in pilot projects and in regulatory changes . 
It &apos;s got a lot of great books on this subject . 
That Al Gore book . We have the choice . And David McKay &apos;s Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air . They 
go it really through and they can create a framework in which this is widely discussed . Because we need to have support from everybody to do this . 
It &apos;s got a lot to do . There &apos;s a lot to come together . 
That &apos;s a wish . 
It &apos;s a very concrete wish that we can invent this technology . 
If you tell me just one wish for the next 50 or so years . I could give the president a choice : A vaccine , and I love that . Or I could choose that wish , right ? The one is halved energy price . Without CO2 , it &apos;s invented . It &apos;s this desire that would be sewn . 
I , this one , has the greatest impact . 
If we do that wish , we don &apos;t get that desire , the gap between long @-@ term and short @-@ term thinking . People , terrible , will get between the United States and China , between poor and rich countries , and almost all of them will live on these two billion . Very much worse . 
What do we have to do ? So 
what measures do I appeal for ? 
We have to work for more research funding . 
If countries are to be in places like Koppenhagen , they should not only be meeting on CO2 . 
They should be talking about this innovation strategy . And they would be shocked by the ridiculous low money that they spend on these innovative approaches . 
We need market incentives . We need carbon taxes . CAP &amp; amp ; Trade , something that sends out a price signal . 
We need to get the message across . 
We need dialogue , more rational and complete , and we also need to do the things that the government is doing . 
It &apos;s a very important wish . But I think we can do it , we can . 
Thank you very much . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . Thank you . 
Thank you . Thank you very much . Just to get a little better at understanding Terrapower . First of all , you can give us an idea of the scale of this investment . 
Bill Gates : To simulate the simulation on a supercomputer . Everybody big scientists to get what they &apos;re doing , what we need is just a few 10 million . And even if we &apos;re using our materials in a Russian reactor to test our materials to make sure it works reasonably . Is it just in the &apos; 100s that you 
&apos;re tough ? Step is that building the first one reactor , another billion , you find . The regulations and the place of the actual place that &apos;s the first one to build . 
Once the first one is finished , when it &apos;s running the way it promised , everything is very clear . Because the economy , the energy density , is so different from nuclear energy as we are familiar with . 
CA : So to get that right . That means deep into the ground . Almost like a vertical column of nuclear fuel . This used uranium . And then it starts the process up there , and it continues to work . After downward . 
BG : Exactly . Today , you have to always build the reactor . So there &apos;s a lot of people and a lot of controls going wrong , this thing where you can open it and things in or inside it . This is not good . 
If you do , however , you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years . Think about it . A column that you bury without the need to cover all the complexities . 
And it sits there and it burns 60 years for . And then it &apos;s done . 
CA : A nuclear reactor that itself has a solution to the garbage . 
BG : Yeah . Now , what about the garbage that happens ? You can do it sit . It &apos;s got much less garbage . It &apos;s a method that you use , and then you take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it further . 
And we start by starting by putting the garbage that &apos;s already in existence , which is in these refrigerators or dry tanks at the reactors . That &apos;s our starting fuel . So that &apos;s 
what we think about these reactors as a problem . That &apos;s what we think about in our fill , and that &apos;s dramatically reducing the garbage volume . While this process is going on , about , 
but as you &apos;re working with different people in the world on these possibilities . 
Where is that greatest interest ? So what really is going to happen ? 
BG : Well , we &apos;ve got no time yet to get stuck in one place . And it &apos;s a lot of interesting disclosure rules for everything that &apos;s nuclear in the name . It &apos;s big interest and it &apos;s people in the company who were in Russia , India , China . I was here , and I &apos;ve been meeting the energy minister and talking about how this is fit for the energy agenda . 
I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the French and Japanese have something in their minds in the direction . 
This is a variant of one thing . The one that was done . 
The one is an important step forward . But it &apos;s like a quick @-@ reaction engine . And some countries have these built these . That &apos;s why anyone who &apos;s building a quick @-@ reaction reactor is a candidate for our first one . 
CA : In your imagination , timeframe and probability , this is really what you think you &apos;re going to be doing . 
BG : Well , we need one of these scalable , power @-@ generating things that is very cheap . We have 20 years to invent . And then 20 years to deploy . 
That &apos;s kind of the deadline , which is the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet . 
And you know , Terrapower , if everything goes well . And that &apos;s a big one . Wish could that easily hold . 
And fortunately , there are dozens of people today . And we need hundreds of people who do the same . If they start working , the promotion for their pilots works , right ? For that , they can offer . 
And it would be best if they could do several , because then they could do one mix , right ? And in any case , 
we need a solution . 
CA : So , with regard to the big , possible breakthroughs , this is the biggest thing you know . 
BG : An energy break is the most important thing . 
That would be it without the energy challenge . But the power is still doing that . A lot more important 
in the nuclear sector . Is there any other innovative companies ? Do 
you know , we know about their work not as well as this ? But it &apos;s the modular method that exists . That &apos;s a different approach . 
It &apos;s a liquid reactor type that has a little bit of a difficulty . But maybe you &apos;re saying that about us . 
And so there &apos;s different ones . But that &apos;s nice about it is that a uranium molecule , a million times as much energy as a say , has a carbon molecule . And that &apos;s why , if you &apos;re dealing with the problems and they &apos;re mainly the radiation of the footprint and the cost is that it &apos;s potential . So , the impact on the country and others , almost all in one &apos;s own league . 
CA : If that doesn &apos;t work , what 
do we have to do then is take emergency measures to try and keep the Earth temperature stable ? 
BG : If you &apos;re in this situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;re too much eaten . And for a moment before a heart attack , what do you do ? You need , maybe , a heart surgery or something like that . 
It &apos;s got a research that &apos;s going on called geoengineering , which is going to look at different techniques to heat up , so we can 20 or 30 years longer get to get together . 
That &apos;s just one insurance method . 
You hope that we can &apos;t do that . 
Some people say you should even do it , not just at insurance , because you can &apos;t do it lazy , so you can eat on , because you know you can eat heart surgery , you can save you . 
I know not whether that &apos;s smart . If you look at the importance of this problem , you can see . But it &apos;s now a discourse . In geoengineering , there &apos;s a discourse about whether to have that available . If the things get faster or faster , or this innovation takes longer than we expect . 
CA : Climate skeptics , do you have one or two sentences for those around you , perhaps to convince you ? 
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps . 
Those who are using scientific arguments are very little , 
say , they say it has negative effects that are associated with clouds , and they have 
negative effects . The things are shifting . It &apos;s very , very few things that you can even say . There &apos;s a chance of that in a million of them . That &apos;s 
the main problem here , and it &apos;s similar to AIDS . 
You make the mistake . Now , and you pay very much for it much later . 
And that &apos;s why the idea is , now , if you can solve all sorts of urgent problems , to invest in something that you &apos;re going to have later on . And to do that , the investment is not so clear that it &apos;s going to be . In fact , the IPCC Report is not necessarily . That &apos;s the worst scenario . And it &apos;s people in the world of rich countries who are in the IPCC and they &apos;re saying , &quot; Okay . That &apos;s not a big drama . It &apos;s 
the fact that this uncertainty gives us cause for concern . 
But my dream here is that this is that if you look at it economically and at the same time eliminate CO2 , then the skeptics are saying , too . Okay . It &apos;s interesting to me not that it &apos;s not emitting CO2 . I wish it almost did , that it did . But I &apos;m going to accept it , because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method , I think . CA 
: And that would be your answer to Björn Lomborg . ( Laughter ) The argument that if you were to spend all this time and energy on the CO2 problem , you would have to solve it . All of the other goals . Among them , poverty reduction is suffering . The fight against malaria and so on and so on , that it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources , money to invest in it , while it &apos;s better things that we can do . 
BG : Well , actual spending on the research is , let &apos;s say , the U.S. should be 10 billion a year spending more than it is doing today . That &apos;s not the dramatic thing . 
It should be other things . It should not be suffering . 
You come along to big amounts of money . And here you can have reasonable people contradictory . If you do have something that &apos;s not economically sound and you try to finance it . For me , this is where most waste happens . It &apos;s 
unless you &apos;re very , very close to a breakthrough in cost , and you only fund the learning curve . I think we should do more things , try and do the potential , a lot cheaper , to be very , much cheaper . 
If the swab is the one you get , a very high energy price . Then you can only get the rich to keep up . 
I mean , each of us here could have five times as much for our energy , spend without having to live his lifestyle . For 
the lower two billion , but is it a disaster ? And 
even Lomborg thinks about 
his own new mesh , is it ? Now why is the research not going to be discussed anymore ? He 
&apos;s always going to be discussed because of his earlier stories with the skeptic camp . But he has understood that this is one very lonely group , and he &apos;s a very lonely group . And that &apos;s why 
he &apos;s now bringing the research argument . And that &apos;s a thought that he 
&apos;s advocating for me , which is research . It &apos;s just crazy , how little . The one that 
&apos;s supported is CA Bill . I think I &apos;m speaking for almost everybody . If I say , &quot; I really hope that your wish is going to come true . &quot; Thank you very much . 
BG : Thank you . 
I would like to give you a little bit of what I was told a few months ago when I wrote an article for Italian Wired . 
I noticed when I was writing , that my synonymous dictionary was always ready for use . But I was with the editing of the text already done . And I noticed that I noticed I was never before in my life looking at what I was doing . What that word hinders really means , really . 
I read you the entry that 
I was reading about , disabled . Object : Curved . Helpless , useless . Destroyed . Deceased , mutilated . Wounded , prepared , paralyzed , separated . Keep it away . Defeat , weakened , impotent , castrated , paralyzed . Gehandicapt.deceased , senil Age @-@ weak from circulation , withdrawn , improved , done . Dead @ depressed , borrowed , counted ( see also injured , useless and weak ) 
@ antonyme @ healthy , strong Efficient I have these 
lists for a friend according to my reading and I had to laugh first . It worked like this ridiculous . But I came only until I was prepared and couldn &apos;t do any more and had to stop reading and reading and first gather . After that assaulted flood of words and the 
associated emotional shock , Of course , that was a frayed old synonym dictionary . I have become just wondering that I was going to have a pretty 
old edition . But actually , it was an issue on the early &apos; 80s . When I was just talking to primary school , and I started doing that , my self @-@ image outside of my family environment started to build and shape , including in relation to other children and the rest of the world . To get around me 
and God be thankfully , I did back then not use a synonymous dictionary , 
I would seriously take this entry . Would I be into a world where I was born of someone like me as a person who would perceive life in no way positive in any way ? Today , however , I &apos;m going to vote for the opportunities and adventures I &apos;ve experienced . I &apos;m celebrated . 
So , I &apos;ve immediately been celebrating the online edition of 2009 , and I expected that I &apos;m going to make a more appealing contribution here . 
Here &apos;s the updated version . This entry , 
unfortunately , is not much better . In particular , 
I &apos;ve been shocked by the last two words under Near Antonym . Very much healthy . But 
it &apos;s not just about the issue of the words . 
It &apos;s about what we &apos;re talking about about people , the people we think about with these words . 
It &apos;s about the values , the values that are in those words , and how we describe these values . 
Our language influences our thinking and our way of shaping the world and the people around us , our 
way of thinking . Many ancient societies , including those of the Greeks and the Romans , really believed that the Greeks and Romans &apos; debate of a curse has a great force , because what you say loud also manifests itself , can manifest itself . 
So what do we want ? Actually , manifest . You have a disabled person . People or a powerful person . People alone , 
already a human being , mindless as a child , could be enough to limit them and to impose ideas on them . 
Would it not be more beautiful to open doors to them ? 
A human being who , for me , opened doors was my pediatrician . On A / I DuPont Institute in Wilmington , Delaware . 
He &apos;s called Dr. Pizzutillo . A Italo @-@ American whose name , like you can imagine . The majority of Americans , who don &apos;t have the right language to pronounce . So , he &apos;s always become Dr. P. 
And Dr. P. was always very , very colorful flies , and he was very busy working with kids , just like he was created . 
I found the time that I found in this hospital that I spent , just great , except for my physiotherapy . 
I had to do some exercises , seemingly infinitely often , with these thick elastic bands in different colors . That &apos;s what you know about it . My leg muscles . And I have these bands more than hated than anything else . I have them hated . I have them cursed . I have them hated . 
And I have them hated . And imagine , I even negotiated with Dr. P. as a kid of five . And so this is how these exercises try to stop . Natural , without success . 
And one day , he has me at a one of my exercises . These exercises were simple , tiring , merciless . And he said to me , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young . Girl : You &apos;re going to be one of those tapes one day . And 
when you break it , give it to you a hundred dollars . &quot; 
That was , of course , just a simple trick by Dr. P. to get the exercises done , which I don &apos;t want to do . With the view that richest five @-@ year @-@ old girls in the hospital on the second floor will be . But he has me actually to do that , actually , to bring my daily exercise horror to new eyes . So this has turned into a new and promising experience . 
And I ask myself today how I feel about his vision of me as a strong and powerful young . Girl : My self @-@ image has shaped and I imagine myself like this , as a self @-@ image that is inherently strong , powerful and atlethic , human being . That &apos;s 
just one example of just a lot . How adults in power positions can imagine the imagination of a child ? 
But how the ones I &apos;ve already mentioned from the synonymous dictionaries prove that our language allows us no space , no space , to imagine something . What we &apos;re all hoping for would be for each and every one of us to be able to make ourselves a powerful human being . 
Our language lags behind in social change . The changes that are often caused by technological change in many cases , by medical considerations . 
From a medical perspective , of course , one can say that my legs , laser surgery for visually impaired visually impaired , knee joints made of titanium and artificial hip joints for aging bodies , which allow people to really use all their possibilities and to transcend the limits of their natural destiny , beyond the limits that they have set , to not speak at all . Of social networking platforms , people enable themselves to have their own identity , give themselves to their own way , define themselves and 
thereby become global in nature , oriented towards groups that they themselves choose , 
Maybe that &apos;s why this technological shift makes it clearer . Because ever before , it &apos;s always been a different truth that has been that every human being in society has something very special and very powerful giving , and that every human being &apos;s ability to adapt . Our greatest plus is 
the human being &apos;s ability to adapt . That &apos;s a really interesting story . Because people tell me time and again about asking me to tell how I can deal with adversity . And I &apos;m going to confess something to you : This sentence has . It &apos;s never been fitting to me , and I &apos;ve always been very uncomfortable with the questions of people about it , and I &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable with it . And I think gradually , I understand why . 
This sentence from dealing with adversity is living on the idea of the success or happiness or happiness depends on it . A challenge to master without being driven by it . As if my life is so successful , as my life has been possible because I can see the possible traps of a life with a prosthesis . Or , as in any case , people , with my disability , perceive me . 
But the truth is that we have to change . Of course , we are facing the challenge . No matter whether you &apos;re physical , emotional or even both . 
And I &apos;m saying that &apos;s good , right ? Distress is not an obstacle that we curve . 
It &apos;s not an obstacle that we have to curve to make our lives clearer . Distress is just 
an adversity that belongs to our lives . 
And I tend to be adversaries as my shadow . 
Sometimes I realize that he &apos;s very present . Sometimes he &apos;s hardly too visible . But he &apos;s constantly on the table with me . 
And I want to make absolutely no sense of the impact or severity of the fight of a human being . It &apos;s in life 
adversity and adversity and challenges . And the challenges are all too real . And each person goes with it differently , right ? But the question is not whether or not we can make it clear with adversity , but how we can make it clear . 
We are , therefore , not only responsible for that . The people who we love before we hit fate , but also to keep them ready to do that . All right . 
So that &apos;s what we do . Clearly , the answer is : And we are doing our children no favours . If we give them the feeling that we feel they &apos;re not adapting , You have to do two things . 
Sure . Separate . Go one way : The medical fact amputees the other . And then go the social opinion , the social opinion , about whether I &apos;m disabled or not . 
And to be honest , the truth is , the only real and lasting disability that I have to deal with is the only real disability that I have to deal with is that the world is constantly saying . It can tell me with these definitions . 
In our desire to make people understand what they are , to protect the people that are close to us , and to tell them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis , or even to make a prognosis of the quality of life that they are expected to be . We must be careful not to lose the foundation for us not to actually obstruct someone from being disabled . 
Perhaps it is the current concept that is only looking at what is happening in a broken . And how we do that , repair it for each individual , greater disability than pathology , in itself . 
If we do a human being not treat holistically and not all of his forces and possibilities and possibilities . And acknowledge creates , in addition to the natural struggle , the natural struggle that you may need to wage . 
A further disease . We degrade a human being who is responsible for our society , a human being . 
So we need to talk about patology beyond patology and look at the whole range of areas of human possibilities . 
At the very most important point , though , is that there is a gap between perception of our inadequacies and our great inventive spirit . 
A connection exists , we should connect these challenging times , not devalue or deny . We should not try to try to avoid them . We should not try to avoid them , nor should we sweep them under the carpet , but rather , to identify opportunities in adversity . 
It &apos;s my maybe more about looking at the odds that I think we don &apos;t necessarily overcome adversity , but that we need to be open to it , embrace it . You , the head , to grab it , and also , for once , use a fight expression , and maybe even dance with it . 
And maybe you can do it , as something natural , coherent and useful , to see adversity and feel like this through your presence , not anymore , so burdened . In 
this year , we celebrate the 200th anniversary of Charles &apos; Darwin . And as he was 150 years ago about evolution , he wrote about evolution , Darwin , in my eyes , has something very true in human character . I would like 
to rewrite it that way , not the strongest of his kind survives , nor does he survive the smartest of his kind , but of the one that can best adapt to change . 
From conflicts , creativity does not only emerge 
from Darwin &apos;s work . Knowledge , we know that the ability of man to survive and flourish from struggle of the human mind . Determined is the struggle of conflict to change . 
So again , change and adaptation are the greatest abilities of the human being . 
And maybe you know , first of all , what wood ? We carved are when we really are tested . 
Maybe it &apos;s that that &apos;s the meaning of adversity . It &apos;s that perception of the ego , a sense of our own power . 
We can feel that way ourselves . 
We can give ourselves something to adversity , a new meaning , that goes beyond difficult times . 
Maybe we can give adversity as change . 
Adversity stands for a change in the way we feel like we don &apos;t yet adapted . 
I think that the greatest damage that we do to ourselves is the greatest damage we believe we do normal , that we should be normal . 
Let &apos;s face it , who is normal ? 
It &apos;s not normal . 
It &apos;s normal . The typical thing is , but not normal , and would you do those poor , gray person ? Really , get to know if it wanted you to really do ? 
I think more of it would not be great . 
If we did this paradigm of normality against a different one , the possibility or the strength around it , even the normal one , and even a little more dangerous . Exchange could be . So , we can exchange the forces of very many children , free of charge . And they can invite them to reopen their very special and valuable abilities into society , to 
bring them into the society . Anthropolgen has found out that we have human beings from members of our society , one thing that we &apos;ve always demanded of us is to be useful and to contribute . 
It &apos;s evidence that there are already some Neanderthals who , 60 000 years ago , older people and people with severe physical injuries . With worn , worn , and this may have happened because life experience in the struggle for survival of these people is valuable to society . 
They have these people , not as broken , useless , not seen . They have been seen as something special and valuable . 
They have been treated as something special and valuable . A few years ago , I went to a food market in the city where I grew up . In that Red Zone , in the northeast of Pennsylvania , and I stood there in front of a cup of tomatoes . 
It was summer . And I had shorts on and 
I had shorts , and I hear a guy . Behind me , &quot; Well , if that &apos;s not Aimee Mullins and I 
turn myself , I turn around and see this older man . I had no idea who he was . 
And I meant , &quot; Excuse me . Sir , do we know ? &quot; I can &apos;t get to you . I can &apos;t remember you . And 
he said , &quot; Well , you should hardly remember that I was . &quot; When 
I saw you for the first time , I saw you out of my belly of her mother . &quot; 
Oh . So , the , &quot; 
and of course , it did , but click . 
That was Dr. Kean . A man who I only made of narratives of my mother about this day , because I knew about this day , of course , typical of my birthday , two weeks late , the doctor for prenatal diagnostics of my mother was on vacation . 
And so , my parents knew the man , the man , who gave me birth , not at all . 
And because I was without a calf &apos;s legs . And my feet , after them , were facing , and I just had a few toes on this and one , and a few toes . AM THE OTHER foot was he was the carrier . This stranger had to take the bad news . 
He said to me , &quot; I had to tell your parents that you never would walk and never walk like that and would never be so mobile . How others kids or that you would never be an independent life , you could never live . And since then , they &apos;ve just lied me . Really 
? Exceptional . I found that he &apos;s been cutting newspaper clips of my entire childhood . No matter whether I was competing for a letter in second grade , whether I was winning with the scouts at the scouts parade , Halloween parade , traveling with the scouts , whether I was on my scholarship or one of my sporting victories , and he used these clips to get his students to teach . Medical students from Hahnemann Medical School have been trained at Hershey Medical School . 
And he called this part of his course the X factor factor , the potential of human will . 
You can just not do enough to stress how crucial this factor is to quality of life for a human being . 
And Dr. Kean told us . He said , &quot; I learned that children , if they don &apos;t do something else all the time . And so even if they just do a little bit of support , if you kids themselves are left with , then children can do a lot . Look 
at it . DR : Kean has his thinking changed . 
He had understood that the medical care diagnosis and how someone could do with it is 
two different things . And also , I have my thinking in the course of time changed . If you want to tell me at the age of 15 , if I wanted to know if I could use my prostheses against legs of meat and bone , I wouldn &apos;t have hesitated for a second . 
I wanted to do it normally at the time . 
If you wanted to do that today , I &apos;m not sure I &apos;m . 
And that &apos;s what happened because I have something to do with my legs and not with my legs , despite these experiences . 
And maybe I could have done that change because I was so many people I &apos;ve met who have doors open to me instead of people opening up to me , who restrict me or give me an idea . 
See , you . It takes a real , just a person to demonstrate to you . How you demonstrate your forces can manifest them . And you &apos;re through when 
you &apos;re doing it to somebody to make their own inner forces activated . The human mind is like this receptive . When you do that and for you to be in a critical moment , a door open to someone . Then you &apos;re for those people . Very , very good teachers . 
You bring them to themselves , you bring doors 
to open . The real meaning of the word educate is rooted in the word educe . It 
means something to produce that in a word is the potential to tickle out , 
again , what potential do we want ? Because now , 
retrieve in the &apos; 60s , in Britain , a case study was done . Back then , high schools were transformed into schools . 
They call this there streaming trials . In the United States , we call this tracking . 
The students are being trained for grades . 
And the A students are being orally harder to get tested . The better teachers , etc . 
, they then have a three @-@ month period of time , students with a sufficiently high grade , very well given . It was given to them that they were aces , that they were very smart . And after these three months , they had really one letter written . 
And of course , it breaks you the heart to hear that the other way around , the one @-@ serer students were told . They were just enough . And 
the same was the case . After the three months , too . But only 
those who always have to go to school still were , apart from the students who were at school , who had to miss the school . 
All the more important . The key thing in this study was that teachers were not inaugurated . 
The teachers knew not that something was changed . 
They were just told that they were the Einser students and that they were the students with the grade enough . And the same way they gave them something , and they treated them as 
the only real disability is a broken mind . A mind that was broken has a mind that has no hope anymore . It finds nothing more beautiful , it lacks . Our natural , childish curiosity and our innate ability to imagination , 
If we do , however , we can create the human mind to help continue to hope , to hope , to hope for ourselves and other people around us , to find beautiful , curious and imaginative . Then we put our forces really , really positively . 
A : If a mind is above these qualities , we can have a new reality and new forms of existence . 
I want to talk to you about a poem that was written by a Persian poet named Hafiz in the 14th century . And by the one that my friend Jacques Dembois tells me about , and the poem is called &quot; The God Who Only Words Four . &quot; Every child knows God , not the God of the Name . Not the God of Forbitions , but the God of God , who only knows four words . And these are repeated all the time . He says , &quot; Just 
come dance with me . &quot; &quot; Come dance with me . Thank you very much . &quot;
