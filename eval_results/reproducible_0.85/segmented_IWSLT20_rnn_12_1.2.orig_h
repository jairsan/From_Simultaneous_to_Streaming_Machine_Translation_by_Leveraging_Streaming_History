A few years ago
Here at TED , Peter Skillman presented a design competition called &quot; The Marshmallow Challenge . &quot; The idea is .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
Four teams have to have the widest possible freestanding structure with 20 spaghetti .
CA : 1m tape .
CA : 1m thread .
And a marshmallow building , the marshmallow has to be up on top .
And though it &apos;s really simple , it &apos;s actually really hard because it &apos;s pushing people , very quickly , to work together .
And so I thought this was a really interesting idea .
And I did it into a design workshop .
It was a huge success .
Since then , I &apos;ve had about 70 workshops around the world .
With students , developers and architects , even CTOs , Fortune 50 companies , and there &apos;s something about this task .
What deep impressions into nature .
Working together allows , and I want to share some of these with you .
Normally , most people start themselves , in terms of the task of orienting themselves .
They talk about it .
They think about what it will look like .
They &apos;re rangling for power .
Then they invest a little time in planning .
And organization : They sketch .
And they put spaghetti out .
They invest a lot of their time in assembling .
Constantly growing structures .
And finally , just before they don &apos;t have time anymore , someone takes the Marshmallow .
And they put it gently on the top , step .
One step back and admire TA @-@ da .
They admire their work .
But then what ?
Almost .
Always , it happens that TA @-@ da becomes an UH @-@ Oh , because the weight of the marshmallow causes the whole thing to bend and collapse , and there &apos;s a series of people who have a lot more UH @-@ Oh moments than others .
And among the worst are freshest BWL graduates .
They lie , they cheat .
They &apos;re confused .
And they produce really poor entities .
And of course , there are also teams that have much more TA @-@ DA formations .
And among the best are freshness graduates of the kindergarten , and that &apos;s quite amazing .
How Peter told us , they don &apos;t just produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
What you might ask is , how does this come about ?
Why ?
What about those ?
And Peter doesn &apos;t tell one .
The kids spend time in it . Head of Spaghetti GmbH , right ?
They don &apos;t spend time in power struggles .
There &apos;s still one more reason , however , and that is that BWL students were trained to do a real plan .
OK ?
And then to realize what then happens , right ?
If you want to get the Marshmallow to the top , you don &apos;t have time anymore .
And what happens ?
It &apos;s a crisis .
Sounds familiar .
What ? What do kindergarten kids do differently ?
Is that they do with the Marshmallow ?
And prototypes build successful prototypes .
Always with the Marshmallow at the top .
So they do multiple times , they have the opportunity to repair dilapidated prototypes .
Constructors recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of an iterative process .
And with every attempt , the kids get immediate feedback .
What works and what doesn &apos;t work .
So this is performance with prototypes to work .
Essential .
But let &apos;s see how different teams operate .
The average for most is about most of them , about 50 centimeters . BWL students make up half of it .
Lawyers , a little bit more .
But not much .
Kindergarten kids are better than adults .
Who is most successful ?
Architects .
And engineers , luckily .
1M : Is the highest ?
What I &apos;ve seen and why ?
Because they understand triangles .
And self @-@ reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building stable structures .
CEOs are a little above average .
But here it gets interesting .
If you put an executive administrator on the team , they become significantly better .
It &apos;s incredible .
You can see around and see this team is going to win .
You can predict that .
Why is that ?
Because you have special process monitoring skills .
You run the process .
You understand it .
And that team that controls and controls and works closely is going to perform the team &apos;s performance significantly better .
Specialized skills and process skills and their combination lead to success .
If you have 10 teams that are typical of what they do , you get .
CA : 6 : Stable structures , I tried something exciting now .
I thought , let &apos;s get the poker bet right away .
So I offered a $ 10,000 prize of software for the winners , what do you think happened ?
With these design students , what was the result ?
This happened . Not a team had a stable structure .
If anyone had a two @-@ inch construction built , he would have won the prize home , is it ?
So it &apos;s not interesting that high betting , high betting , has a strong effect .
We repeated this exercise with the same students .
What do you think ?
Did it happen ?
Well , you understood the advantage of prototyping .
So it turned out to be the same bad team .
One of the best ones , they produced the highest construction in the least time .
There &apos;s a profound lesson for us about the nature of nature , of drive and success .
You may ask questions .
Why would someone actually invest time ?
A Marshmallow Challenge , to create , the reason is , I &apos;m helping create digital tools and processes to help teams .
Cars , video games and visual effects .
And what the Marshmallow Challenge does is it helps them create hidden assumptions , and it helps them identify hidden assumptions .
Because frankly , every project has its own Marshmallow .
The challenge is to have a shared experience .
A common language or basic attitude , the right prototype to build .
And this is the value of this experience .
This so simple exercise and those of you who have an interest in it can do .

Visit
It &apos;s a blog where you can see .
How to get the Marshmallows built .
There &apos;s a step @-@ by @-@ step guide there .
You &apos;ll find crazy examples from all over the world .
How people can optimize the system ?
And they &apos;ll refiner it . There &apos;s also world records .
And the basal lesson , I think , is the construction .
In fact , a connecting sport is that it requires that we all put our senses on the task .
And that we should optimally use our thinking , like our feelings .
And our doing in the challenge , the challenge ahead of us , and sometimes a small prototype .
This experience , everything it takes .
We &apos;re told from an UH @-@ Oh to a TA @-@ DA moment , and that can make a big difference .
Thank you .
Let &apos;s pretend we have here , here , a machine , a big machine .
A cool , TED @-@ like machine , and this is a time machine .
And everybody in this room has to enter and you can go into the past .
You can go into the future .
You can &apos;t go into the here and now .
And I wonder what you &apos;re choosing .
Would you , because I &apos;ve been asking my friends a lot lately ?
That question was , and they wanted to get all of you into the past .
I don &apos;t know .
They wanted to go back to time before cars were there or Twitter or America is looking for the superstar .
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m convinced that somehow you &apos;re going to be drawn to nostalgia , to wishful thinking .
And that &apos;s what I understand .
I &apos;m not part of this group , I have to say .
I don &apos;t want to go back to the past , and that &apos;s not because I &apos;m an adventurer .
It &apos;s because opportunities on this group are not back on the planet .
They &apos;re going forward .
I want to go into this machine .
And I want to go into the future .
This is the greatest time it &apos;s ever been on this planet .
No matter what scale you &apos;re applying .
Health , wealth .
Mobility , opportunities , falling rates of disease .
There has never been a time like this before .
My great grandparents all died when they were 60 .
My grandparents urged this number to 70 .
My parents are 80 , 80 , on their heels .
There should be better a nine , at the beginning of my death .
But it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing , you know .
When this is a child who is now born in New Delhi , you can expect to live as long as the richest man on earth can .
100 years ago , you think about it .
This is an incredible fact .
And why is this ?
Skirts , smallpox , smallpox , have billions of people on this planet killed .
They &apos;ve got the demographics of the Earth .
They &apos;ve been redesigned in a way that no war .
JE has ever managed to do . They &apos;re gone .
They &apos;ve disappeared .
We &apos;ve defeated them .
Puff in the rich world : There are diseases .
The millions of us , just one generation ago , who have threatened .
Hardly any diphtheria is rubbing polio .
Does it know at all ?
Somebody else ? What is that ?
Vaccines .
Modern medicine .
Our ability to reach out to billions of people .
These are successes of the scientific method , and in my view , the scientific method is to try things out .
Look at whether it works .
It changes when it doesn &apos;t .
One of the greatest achievements of humanity , so this is the good news .
Unfortunately , this is the whole good news .
Because there &apos;s a few other problems .
And they &apos;ve been mentioned many times .
And one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people in the world every day are hungry to bed .
Are these numbers rising and rising ? And they &apos;re rising very quickly .
And that &apos;s embarrassing .
And not only that .
We have our imagination used to do that .
This world to devastate thoroughly : Drinking water , primal land , rainforests , oil , gas .
They disappear , and they disappear soon .
And if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos , they disappear .
We , too , the question is : Can we do that ?
I think so .
I think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food .
The billions of people who feed without the land on which they live will be raped .
I think we can make this world energy @-@ powered .
They can &apos;t destroy it at the same time .
I think that &apos;s really what it is .
And no .
That &apos;s not wishful thinking .
But this is what keeps me awake at night .
One of the things that awakes me at night is we have scientific progress never before , so much needed as we have never before .
And we &apos;ve also never been to the point where we could make it reasonable .
We used to use it as we can today .
We &apos;re at the threshold of amazing things .
Amazing events .
Many areas .
And yet , I really think we have hundreds of 300 years before the Enlightenment , back to go back to a time to find a time .
In which we fight progress , in which we talked about these things more violently , we fought .
More fronts than we do now .
People cover themselves in their faith ,
And that &apos;s so narrow that they &apos;re not free .
Not even the truth is going to happen .
They liberate and hear .
Everybody has a right to their opinion .
Even a right to their opinion about progress .
But you know what they don &apos;t have a right to , they don &apos;t have a right to their own facts .
Testimonization : They don &apos;t have a right .
And I have a while to make that out , about about a decade ago .
I have an article about immunization for The New Yorker , written a little article , and I was amazed at resistance to meet resistance , resistance to resistance to what was ultimately what was the most effective measure .
In health care , in the history of humanity , I didn &apos;t know what to do .
So I just did what I always do .
I wrote an article and I went on .
And soon thereafter , I wrote an article on genetically modified food that was the same thing .
Only bigger people played crazy .
So I also got a paper about it .
And I couldn &apos;t understand why the people thought this was something like frankenfood .
Why did they think molecules were on a certain molecule , rather than a random way of moving around , an attack on nature ?
But you know , I do what ?
I do . I wrote the article .
I went on .
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist .
We type , we type , we reach .
We go eat .
That &apos;s okay .
But these articles made me worry .
And I couldn &apos;t figure out .
Why ?
And eventually , I found out .
And that &apos;s because these fanatics are the fanatics that made me crazy .
Anyway , no fanatics were at all . These were prudent people .
Educated people , decent people .
They were just like people in the same room .
And that got me so confused .
But then I thought , &quot; You know what ?
Let &apos;s be honest .
We &apos;re on one point , at which we &apos;re not at the same relationship to progress , right ?
As we used to talk .
Intermediate about that . We talk ironically about it with small quotes .
So progress , okay ?
There &apos;s a reason for that .
And I think we know what reasons that are .
We have confidence in institutions , in authority and sometimes in institutions , in science itself , in themselves .
And there &apos;s no reason .
Why ?
That &apos;s not .
That should be the way you can just name a few names .
And people will understand .
Chernobyl , Bhopal , Challenger , Vioxx , weapons of mass destruction , the 2000 US presidential election .
I mean , you know , you can have your own list .
There are questions .
And there are problems with the people we thought we were going to be right .
Be , therefore , skeptical .
Imagine questions , ask evidence .
Ask evidence .
Ask evidence . Take nothing but given .
But now it &apos;s when you get evidence , you have to accept that evidence .
And in that , we &apos;re not good at .
And I can do that for the reason that we &apos;re now in a epidemic of epidemic of fear , as I do , as I &apos;ve never seen before .
And hopefully never again , I &apos;ll see about 12 years ago , a story was published .
A terrible story .
Those who have been able to cope with the autism epidemic with measles , mumps and rubells , vaccines .
Very frightening , horrendous , in some ways , studies were done to see if that was true , horrendous studies .
They &apos;re done . This is a serious matter .
The data came in . The data came in . The data came in from the United States , from England , from Sweden , from Canada , and they were all the same . No correlation .
No connection , no connection at all .
It doesn &apos;t matter .
It doesn &apos;t matter because we &apos;re anecdotes , believe in .
We believe in what we see .
What we see , what we believe in what causes us to feel real .
We don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents from a government clerk who gives us data .
And I understand that .
I think that &apos;s what we all do .
But you know what ?
The result of that was catastrophic .
Catastrophic because of that fact .
The United States is one of the only countries in the world .
In which the vaccination rate for measles is falling , that &apos;s scandalous .
And we should be ashamed .
It &apos;s terrible .
What happened ?
That we do that .
Well , I understand that .
That &apos;s what I do .
Because here &apos;s somebody who has measles , has one in the audience .
Anyone else on measles who sees someone die doesn &apos;t happen very often .
That &apos;s where there &apos;s no happening at all in this country .
But 160,000 times on the planet .
Last year .
That &apos;s a lot of measles dead , 20 per hour .
But because that &apos;s not what happened here , we can displace it .
And people like Jenny McCarthy can walk around .
And messages of fear .
And illiteracy of platforms like Oprah and Larry King live preach preaching .
And that &apos;s what they can do .
Because they cause and correlation not connect .
They don &apos;t understand that these things are equal to be the same .
But almost never .
The same are , and this is something we learn to learn .
And this is very fast .
This guy was a hero .
Jonas Salk : He liberated us from one of the worst scourges of humanity .
Don &apos;t worry , no pain , polio .
Puff disappeared .
The guy in the middle , not so much .
His name is Paul Offit .
He &apos;s just got a few other people with a Rotavirus vaccine .
He can live the lives of 400 , 500,000 children a year .
In the developing world , it &apos;s pretty good to save .
Not now .
That &apos;s good .
Apart from Paul walking around and talking about vaccines and saying , &quot; How valuable they are . &quot;
And that people just stop doing that .
Complaining and complaining , and that &apos;s what he says , &quot; Actually , &quot; so Paul is a terrorist .
If Paul is a public hearing , he can &apos;t speak without armed guards , he can &apos;t say it .
He gets calls at home because the people tell him they like to tell him where they know where his kids are going to school .
And why ?
Because Paul has made a vaccine .
I need not .
I need to say , but vaccines are essential .
Take them away .
Turn the diseases back . Terrible diseases .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s happening right now .
We have in this country now measles and this is getting worse .
And pretty soon , children will get to die of it again .
Because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
And they &apos;re not just going to die of measles .
What about polio ?
Let &apos;s take that .
Why not ?
A fellow militant of mine told me a few weeks ago ,
And said , &quot; She believes I &apos;m a little too shrill .
Nobody has ever had said that before .
She would have no child against polio .
No one , fine .
Why ?
Because we don &apos;t have polio .
And you know what ?
We had in this country yesterday no polio .
Today , I don &apos;t know , maybe this morning somebody went up in Lagos , in an airplane , and is just flying to Los Angeles .
Right now , he &apos;s over Ohio .
And into a few hours , he lands .
And he rents a car .
And he comes to Long Beach and he gets one of those fantastic TED dinner .
This evening , he goes to visit , and he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s infected with a paralyzing disease .
And we know that , either .
Because that &apos;s how the world works .
Well , that &apos;s the planet on which we live . We do .
They don &apos;t pretend he &apos;s going to be that way .
We love it in lies . We love to cover it up .
We love it . We have it .
You guys this morning have taken all your vitamins , Echinacea , a little antioxidant .
That &apos;s what you can get on the leaps .
I know you &apos;re doing that . Because the half of the Americans , that every day , do it .
They take the stuff , and they take alternative remedies , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
How often we find out that they &apos;re useless ?
The data shows this all the time .
They evaporate their urine .
More do they do .
Never before .
This is okay .
They like 28 billion dollars for spending dark urine on it .
I agree with you completely : Dark urine , dark .
Why do we do this ?
Why do we do this ?
Well , I think I understand , we hate the pharmaceutical industry .
We hate one too strong government .
We don &apos;t have confidence in the system .
And that &apos;s what we shouldn &apos;t .
Our healthcare system is bad .
It &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
It &apos;s absolutely amazing cold .
And soul @-@ deafening , even to us who can afford it .
We &apos;re therefore walking away from it , and where are we going ?
We &apos;re walking . We &apos;re walking into the arms of the placebo industry .
That &apos;s great .
I love the placebo industry .
But you know , that &apos;s really a serious matter .
Because the stuff is crap .
And we &apos;re giving billions of dollars for it .
And I &apos;ve got all sorts of little props .
There &apos;s none of them . Gingko was cheating . Echinacea was cheating . Acai .
There I don &apos;t even know what that is .
But we &apos;re giving billions of dollars for it .
It &apos;s cheating .
And you know what ?
If I say that , the screams are screaming at me and saying , &quot; What cares you ? &quot;
&quot; Let people do what they do , anyway . &quot;
So they feel good .
And you know what ?
They &apos;re wrong because it doesn &apos;t matter to me .
Whether it &apos;s the Health Minister who says , &quot; Hmm , I &apos;m going to get the evidence from my experts on mammography , or any cancer quack salver who will treat his patients with coffee intakes . &quot;
If you focus on this path , where do you believe and magic prove ?
And science replace you , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
You get to Thabo Mbeki in South Africa .
He brought 400,000 of his people around because he was insisting on insisting that red beds , garlic and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs .
Of those we know they &apos;re the course of AIDS @-@ inhibiting , you know .
Hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country worse than any other of these diseases plagued by it .
Tell me , please don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
They have them . They have them .
They always have the most brain @-@ free epidemic we &apos;re facing right now , and this absurd battle between the advocates of genetically modified food and the bio @-@ elite .
That &apos;s an idiotic debate .
It has to stop .
It &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
That &apos;s ideology , not science .
Everything we eat .
Every grain of rice .
Every branch of parsley .
Every sprouts has been made by people .
You know , there were no mandarin in paradise .
There were no cantaloupe melons .
There were no Christmas trees .
We have all done this .
We have it in the last 11 000 years .
And some of it worked .
And some of it didn &apos;t .
We got rid of it .
What doesn &apos;t work now we can do it more precisely .
And of course , there are risks .
But we can do something like vitamin A in rice .
And the stuff can do help millions of people , millions of people .
Their lives prolong .
That &apos;s not what they want .
I have to say , &quot; That &apos;s what I understand . &quot;
I don &apos;t .
We reject genetically modified food .
Why do we do that ?
Well , what I hear all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture .
We don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing .
That &apos;s wrong .
We don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
We don &apos;t want companies to own seeds .
And you know what ?
My answer to all of this is yes .
You &apos;re right .
Fix .
We do .
It &apos;s true .
We have a huge food problem .
But that &apos;s not science .
That &apos;s science . It &apos;s not science .
It &apos;s morality . Patent stuff .
You know that science is not a company .
It &apos;s not a country .
It &apos;s not even an idea .
It &apos;s a process .
It &apos;s a process .
And sometimes it works .
And sometimes it doesn &apos;t .
But the idea that we can give science no permission to do their work . Because we &apos;re afraid , it &apos;s a real impasse .
And it keeps millions of people from flourishing .
You know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to get 70 percent more food to grow .
When we &apos;re 70 percent of this investment in Africa right now in the last 30 years , shameful , shameful .
You need that .
And we &apos;re giving it to you .
And why genetically modified food ?
We want people not to be encouraged .
This rotten stuff to eat , like , Maniok Maniok is Maniok , something that &apos;s half a billion people eat .
It &apos;s about like a potato .
It &apos;s just a bunch of calories .
It &apos;s bad .
It doesn &apos;t have nutrients .
It doesn &apos;t have protein .
And scientists are building all this right in there .
And then the people could eat the food .
And wouldn &apos;t they be blind ?
They wouldn &apos;t starve .
And you know what ?
That would be nice .
It wouldn &apos;t be Chez Panisse .
But it would be nice .
And everything I did to say about this is , why do we fight this ?
I mean , questions .
We ask ourselves , why do we fight this ?
Because we don &apos;t want to push genes around .
It &apos;s not about pushing genes around .
It &apos;s not about chemicals .
It &apos;s not about our ridiculous ones .
Passion for hormones .
Our insistence on greater food .
Better food .
A unique food .
It &apos;s not about rice .
Krispies : It &apos;s about keeping people alive .
And it &apos;s high time to understand what that means .
Because , you know what ?
If we don &apos;t do that , if we keep on going as we do .
We get to be guilty of something we believe in , I don &apos;t want to be guilty of .
High @-@ tech colonialism . There &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here .
It &apos;s selfish .
It &apos;s ugly .
It &apos;s not worthy of us .
And we have to really stop that .
After this incredibly fun conversation , you want to say , maybe you always want to be in this ridiculous time machine .
And into the future , go on , anyway .
That &apos;s what I want anyway .
Right now , she &apos;s in the present .
But we have an incredible opportunity .
We can use this time machine to put everything we want .
We can move it where we can move it .
And we will move it there .
Where we want it . We need to .
These conversations and we need to think .
But if we go into the time machine and into the future , we will be happy to see .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve done .
I know we &apos;ve been able to do it .
And as far as I &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something that the world needs now .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you . When Steve Lopez , a columnist of the Los Angeles Times , one day walked through the streets in the center of Los Angeles , he heard wonderful music .
She came from a man , an African @-@ American , sympathetic , rough , homeless .
The guy on a violin that only played two strings left ,
Many of you will hear the story .
Because from Steve &apos;s article about it , a book later became a book .
That , in turn , was filmed with Robert Downey Junior .
When Steve Lopez and Jamie Foxx were Nathaniel Anthony Ayers , the contrabass player who was at the Juilliard Conservatory .
And his promising career tragically early on through his paranoid career .
Schizophrenia was ended . Nathaniel left Juilliard , suffered a nervous breakdown .
And 30 years later , he lived as homeless on the streets of Skid Row in Skid Row , in the center of Los Angeles .
I recommend to all of you that you read Steves &apos; book .
Or to watch the movie .
So you can not only see the wonderful connection that exists between these two men , so you can understand how the music is .
This connection helped and how it helped and how it was the instrument .
If this play of words is allowed , it &apos;s half .
Nathaniel , away from the street , to get away .
I met Mr. Ayers .
In 2008 , two years ago , in the Walt Disney Concert Hall .
He just had a demonstration of Beethoven &apos;s first .
And Fourth Symphony heard and came behind the stage to get involved with me .
He spoke in a very cheerful and sociable tone about yo @-@ yo .
MA : And Hillary Clinton and about how the Dodgers never heard it in baseball world .
And all of this because of the insidious passage of the first violin .
Last sentence of Beethoven &apos;s Fourth Symphony : &quot; We came up with the theme of speaking music . &quot;
And a few days later , I got an email in which I said that Nathaniel was in favor of violin lessons with me .
I still have to mention that Nathaniel is a person who refused medical treatment .
Because he was already in the process of electroshocks and thorazine .
And handcuffs were treated .
Trauma .
That &apos;s what his whole life has been tracking him as a result of .
He &apos;s now particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases .
They &apos;re sometimes so bad that they can make him tear him apart .
And he disappears for days .
In the streets of Skid Row , always wandering around this horror and torture torment of his own mind , and in exactly the same stage of excitement , Nathaniel was when we were with our first lesson in the Walt Disney , Concert Hall , when we started .
He had this crazy flicker in his eyes .
And he was totally lost .
He talked about invisible demons and smoke and about how he was being told in sleep to poison him .
I was afraid , not for me , but for fear that I was going to lose him , that he was going to sink into one of his states .
And that I was going to tell him to destroy his relationship with the violin .
If I started talking about clay ladders and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic .
Violin pedagogy .
I started just to start playing .
I played the first sentence of Beethoven &apos;s violin concerto , and while I was playing , I noticed that in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes , a complete change was taking place .
It was as if he was going to be under the influence of an invisible doctor .
A chemical reaction , the catalyst of which is that .
My game was Nathaniel .
Manian anger turned into understanding , into understanding , into a calm one .
Curiosity and grace .
And as if by a miracle , he took his violin .
And he began to listen .
Some excerpts of violin concerts to play .
And he then asked me to finish them playing .
Mendelssohn Chaikovsky , Sibelius .
We started then about music .
From Bach to Beethoven .
Brahms Bruckner .
And all the others .
BS by Bartók to Bendelssohn @-@ Pekka Salonen and me became a little bit aware that he not only had encyclopaedic knowledge of music , but also he had it with her , a close personal relationship , and he was very much in love with it .
He talked about her with a passion and a sense .
The one I usually talk about is just my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic .
Knowing by music playing and talking about music and music was from this paranoid , confused .
Man who &apos;s just been through the streets of Los Angeles , who was walking around .
A lovely , educated , excellent Juilliard @-@ trained musician .
Music is medicine .
Music changes us for Nathaniel means &quot; .
Music : Mental health , &quot; because music allows him to think .
And delusions with the help of his imagination and creativity into something real .
And so he escapes his tormenting state .
I understood that this is the very essence of art .
This is exactly why this is why we make music so that we can do something that is deep inside of us all .
Our feelings through our artistic lens , through our creativity , towards reality , can shape .
And reality of that expression reaches us all .
And moves , inspires .
And unites us what Nathaniel was about .
So he was brought back by music to a community of friends .
The redeeming power of music brought him back .
It brought him back to a family of musicians who understood him , who recognized his talent and respected him , and I &apos;m going to play with Nathaniel again and again .
Whether in the Walt Disney Concert , Hall or in Skid , Row , because he reminds me of it .
Why ?
I became a musician .
I &apos;m a lot of thanks .
Bruno Giussani : Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Robert Gupta , Robert Gupta : I want to play something .
The one I shamefully stolen the cellist , I hope you forgive me .
I &apos;m Jane McGonigal .
I design computer games .
I &apos;m now developing for 10 years online games .
And my goal for the next decade is to do just as easily as that .
The world where reality is saving the world as it does in online games is saving .
I have a plan for that .
I want more people to convince , including all of you , more time playing bigger ones .
And great games to spend .
Right now , we spend three billion hours a week playing online .
Some of you may think , &quot; This is a lot of time for games .
Maybe something too much time . &quot;
If you think about how many problems we &apos;re facing in real world , how many problems we &apos;re going to solve urgently .
Have actually , however , my research at the Institute for the Future , it &apos;s exactly the opposite .
Right ? Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to make the most pressing problems in the world possible .
In fact , I am convinced that if we are to move on to this planet for the next century , we will have to dramatically increase that time .
I calculated that the time needed to do that is 21 billion hours of playing time a week .
That seems to be a little bit absurd first .
So I repeat it with that .
It can work if we can have problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity .
I think we have to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week by the end of the next decade .
No .
I mean , it &apos;s really serious .
Why ?
This picture pretty accurately describes .
Why ?
I think games are so vital to the survival of human beings .
In the future , they &apos;re serious .
This is a portrait of photographer Phil Toledano .
He wanted to share the feelings of playing .
So he &apos;s in front of the players .
A camera built up .
This is one of the classic expressions .
When playing , if you &apos;re not a player , you may miss some of the nuances in this picture .
You probably see this sense of urgency , some fear .
But also extreme concentration .
It &apos;s deepened .
It &apos;s in solving a really difficult problem .
If you play , you &apos;ll see some nuances .
Here &apos;s the upward @-@ drawn eyes and the mouth , which is a sign of optimism .
The eyebrows show surprise .
This is a player who &apos;s on the edge of what &apos;s called an epic victory .
Oh , you know that .
OK .
Great .
So we have some players .
Here &apos;s an epic victory .
Is a result ?
That &apos;s so very positive that it &apos;s actually not known before that it was possible at all .
It was almost beyond imagination and imagination , and if you get there , you &apos;re shocked that you &apos;re actually going to be able to do that .
That &apos;s an epical victory .
This player is about to be an epic victory .
And this is what we &apos;re going to see on millions of faces of problem solvers around the world .
If we can overcome the hurdles of the next century , the face of those who face the odds .
On the edge of an epic victory .
Well , unfortunately , we see this face more .
In real life , when we face difficult problems .
I call it the &quot; in life &quot; is what I call it .
I mean &quot; bad face . &quot;
And it &apos;s actually my face .
You see , yeah .
OK .
That &apos;s me .
How I do that ?
In life , I &apos;m bad face .
This is a graffiti in my former home country .
In Berkeley , California , where I did my PhD study on why we do better in games than in real life .
This is a problem .
This is a problem that many players have . We think that in reality , we &apos;re not as good as in games .
And I don &apos;t mean just less successful .
Although that &apos;s part of it , we &apos;re doing more in games .
I mean , good in connection with motivation , something important about doing .
Inspired in collaboration with each other .
If we &apos;re in a game world , I think many of us are in our game world , turning into our best version , always and immediately ready to help , persistent .
The problem of trying to solve as long as necessary , after the failure , again .
Try and try , and in reality .
If we fail , if we are encountering obstacles , we feel often different .
We feel overwhelmed .
We feel defeated .
We feel threatened .
Maybe depressed , frustrated .
Or cynically , these feelings we never have .
If we play games in games , there are them just not .
And that &apos;s what I think I &apos;m studying as a PhD student .
Why is it in games ?
Impossible to think .
You couldn &apos;t just achieve everything .
How can we make those feelings out of the games come to reality ?
So I looked at games like World of Warcraft . It &apos;s the ideal environment for playing together to solve problems .
And I have a few things that I &apos;ve noticed : Epic victories in online worlds .
As possible , so first of all , if you &apos;re in one of these online games , especially at World of Warcraft , there are .
It &apos;s a lot of different characters who are willing to give you a world saving mission .
And that is , immediately .
But not just any mission , but a mission .
It &apos;s perfect for your current level in the game .
Right ?
So you can do that .
You never get a task .
You don &apos;t get to solve it .
But always on the edge of your skills , so you have to make an effort .
But there &apos;s no unemployment .
In World of Warcraft , you don &apos;t sit around .
And you turn around , you have fools , you always have fools .
Something important to do .
And there &apos;s employees in ways .
Where they go .
Hundreds of thousands of people working with them to get their epic mission done .
That &apos;s what we have in real life , not that easy .
That feeling that if you have a fingertip , you have employees who are willing to do it in ways .
There &apos;s also this epic story .
This inspiring story , why we &apos;re there and what we &apos;re doing , is this .
Then we get this whole positive feedback .
You &apos;ve probably got from level up and level 1 strength .
Or 1 intelligence .
This constant feedback is not there in the real world .
If I &apos;m leaving this stage , I don &apos;t have 1 speech .
And 1 crazy idea .
20 crazy idea .
I get in real life .
This feedback , not so .
The problem of cooperation online worlds .
How World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying .
Anytime on the edge of an epic victory , that we prefer to stand all our time in these game worlds .
They &apos;re just better than reality .
So far , all of the World of Warcraft players have come together .
5.93 million years .
That &apos;s spent the virtual problems of Azeroth solving .
That &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
It may sound bad .
But to put it in context , it might sound bad 5.93 million years ago .
Our first primate ancestors started walking upright , the first upright primacy .
So OK , so if we talk about how much time we currently spend playing games with , it &apos;s going to be .
That &apos;s just meaning .
When you start to spend time with regard to scale of time in human development ?
In mind what &apos;s extraordinary .
But it &apos;s also appropriate .
Because it turns out that we &apos;re going to be able to do this all the time by playing this game .
In fact , changing what we as humans are able to do .
We &apos;re going to become community .
Thinking , heartfelt beings .
That &apos;s the truth .
That &apos;s what I believe .
Look at this interesting statistic .
The recently published by a Carnegie researcher , Mellon University , published .
The average young person today in the middle of a country with a strong playing culture spends .
10,000 hours with online games , up to the age of 21 .
So 10,000 hours is a very , very interesting number of two reasons .
First of all , for kids in the United States , 10,080 hours is the exact total time they spend in school , from the five @-@ grade to the end of the high school .
If you never lack it , so here we have a complete parallel education path where young people learn the same way .
What it means is a good player to be .
Like anything else you do in the school , you know ?
And maybe some of you have that new book from Malcolm , Gladwell .
Overflying , so you know his theory of success .
The theory of success of 10,000 dollars of success .
It &apos;s based on great research , cognitive science , that if we read 10,000 hours with the laborious study of a given subject , up to the age of 21 , we &apos;ll spend it .
We can master it , we &apos;ll get so good at it , whatever we do .
Like the most important people in the world .
So what we have here is a complete generation of young people , the master players , who are the big question , so what exactly are the players masterful ?
All right .
Because if we figure out that out , we would have never been able to have any human potential before .
So many people we have at the moment in the world .
They have the human potential to have online games for at least an hour a day .
These are our master players , 500 million people , who are exceptionally good at something .
And the next decade , we have another billion players .
The exceptionally good at what , whatever , are .
If you still don &apos;t hear it , the game industry has developed .
Consoles , saving energy and on mobile networks , instead of broadband Internet , so that players all over the world , especially India , China , Brazil , can play online .
You &apos;re expected to have an additional billion players .
Next decade , with this , we &apos;ve got a total of 1.5 billion players .
So I started to think about what it is .
What these games are going to do to us .
So here &apos;s the four things that I found .
First , urgency optimism , OK .
Imagine if you think about extreme self @-@ motivation .
Urgent optimism is desire , right away , to do something .
A hurdle to overcome .
Together with faith that we have a well @-@ founded hope of success .
Players always believe that a epic epic victory is possible .
And that it &apos;s always worth it .
It &apos;s trying , and it &apos;s the same : Players don &apos;t sit around .
Players are masters in spiders .
Poet social networks .
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research .
They show that we people like more after we start working with them .
Even if they &apos;re defeating us badly , the reason for that is that it &apos;s a lot of trust , with somebody playing a game , it takes a lot of trust .
We trust that somebody will have time with us , that people will respect the rules , that we will achieve the same goal .
And by the end of the game , that &apos;s what allows us to play together .
Growing the bonds , trust and trust with each other .
As a result , we build stronger social relationships , happy productivity .
Fantastic .
You know , there &apos;s a reason .
Why ?
The average word of Warcraft player is 22 hours a week , playing as part @-@ time job , so to speak . The reason we play is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier .
Hard to work than if we play ourselves relax or nothing , or do .
We know that we , as human beings , function optimally .
If we do hard , meaningful work and players are always ready , hard to work .
If they do the right job and eventually get epic meaning , players love .
It &apos;s part of awe .
Adorable missions of planetary proportions .
Here &apos;s a background information to get the right light .
You probably know all Wikipedia .
The biggest Wiki in the world .
The second largest Wiki in the world .
With almost 80,000 entries , this is the World of Warcraft .
Wiki : Five million .
People use it every month .
They have more information about World of Warcraft .
They &apos;ve collected it online than they &apos;ve collected about any other topic in any other Wiki .
The world .
They create an epic story .
They create an epic source of knowledge about the world of of Warcraft .
OK .
These are four superpowers .
Those that are one result , players are super @-@ powerful , hopeful individuals .
They are people who believe they &apos;re considered as individuals to be changing the world .
And the only problem is that they believe they can change the virtual worlds .
But not the real ones .
That &apos;s the problem .
That &apos;s solving the problem . Edward Castronova is a scientist .
His work is awesome .
He &apos;s studying why people have so much time , energy .
And money in online worlds , and he says , &quot; We &apos;re witnessing no less than a mass emigration into virtual worlds . &quot;
And online gaming environments , and this from an economist , so he &apos;s logical .
And he doesn &apos;t say the way I do .
I develop games .
I &apos;m a little bit exuberant .
So he says , &quot; This actually makes sense . &quot;
Because players can play more online worlds than they can in real life .
They can play stronger social ties in games .
When they do real life , they get more feedback .
And rewards in games .
When they do real life , so he says , &quot; It &apos;s perfectly logical right now that players have more time in the virtual world than in real life . &quot;
I &apos;m just going to agree , that &apos;s logical .
But it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
We have to start to build the real world into a game .
My inspiration comes from an event .
The 2,500 years back , there &apos;s this ancient cube out of sheep &apos;s cookes .
You know , in front of these fantastic game econtrollers , there were sheep &apos;s cocks , and these were , so to speak , the first people to develop .
Play equipment , and if you &apos;re working with the works of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus .
You may know this story ?
The story about how and why games were invented .
According to Herodotus , games became more accurate craps in the kingdom of Lydia .
During a famine , invented supposedly , there was such a great famine that the king of Lydia was turning into a crazy idea that the king of Lydia suffered the people , the people fought .
It was an extreme situation .
It took an extreme solution .
So they invented , according to Herodotus .
The craps and agreed a national strategy on a day , and you would eat the next day , you would eat .
You would play , and they would play so much deeper into the craps .
There &apos;s games so fascinating and we would be happy with satisfactory , happy productivity that they would forget that there &apos;s nothing to eat .
And then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat , you would eat .
And according to Herodotus , they survived for 18 years .
This famine by living on one day . And on the next day they played .
And I think we &apos;re playing games today .
One : We &apos;re playing games to help alleviate the suffering of the real world .
We &apos;re playing games to make everything go away .
That &apos;s in the real world that doesn &apos;t work .
Everything that works in real life that &apos;s not satisfying .
And we &apos;re getting what we need out of the games .
But that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
That &apos;s the exciting thing .
According to Herodotus , after 18 years of famine , famine didn &apos;t get any better .
So the king decided one last cube game .
They shared the kingdom in two halves .
They played a cube game .
And the winners were allowed to become an epic adventure , they left lydia and they made themselves up looking for a search for a new home .
They just let so many people go back .
As it turns out , there were food for survival .
And they looked for the rest for an area where they could thrive , with the rest .
That sounds crazy , right ?
But the latest DNA evidence shows that the Etruscans , who later became the Roman Empire .
The same DNA as the ancient Lydians have .
So scientists recently came to the conclusion that herodotus , crazy story , is actually true .
And geologists found evidence of global cooling .
The nearly 20 years took , which was to explain the famine .
So this crazy story could be true .
Maybe you actually have your people through games saved by playing by getting 18 years of saving themselves in games , and you know , you know ?
And then this inspiration had , and so much about coexistence , and learning about how to play with each other , that it saved the whole civilization .
So , we can .
We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft since 1994 .
This was the first strategy game in real time .
The World of Warcraft series .
This was 16 years ago .
They played 18 years of craps .
We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft for 16 years .
I &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
So they sent half of their civilization to the search for the search for a new world .
So I &apos;m taking my 21 billion hours of play a week .
We should agree that the half of the world is one hour per day with games , and we should agree that we &apos;re spending half of our time playing .
Until we solve the problems of the real world .
I know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; How do we solve problems ? &quot;
The real world in games .
And that &apos;s exactly the question I &apos;ve got my work on in recent years at the Institute for the Future .
We &apos;ve got this banner in our office in Palo Alto .
It expresses how we can shape the future .
We don &apos;t want to try to predict the future before what we want .
Is the future to be created ?
We want to make the best possible outcome .
And then people are empowered to empower this idea into reality .
We face epic victories . And we give people the opportunity to do it .
To achieve it .
I &apos;ll show you three games very briefly .
The ones I designed to try and try to emulate people epic victories in their own future ,
This is the world without oil .
The game is from 2007 .
It &apos;s an online game where you can see an oil shortage that you have to overcome . Oil scarcity is invented .
But we have enough online content with it .
It &apos;s realistic for you , and it &apos;s making you live your real life .
In fact , without oil , so if you live to play , you tell us where you live .
And then you get news films in real time .
They show you how much oil costs , what it doesn &apos;t exist .
How food supplies are affected , how transportation is affected .
Whether schools are closed , whether there are riots .
And you have to figure out how to make your real life .
If it were true , and we ask you to blog about it , videos or photos .
We have this game with 1,700 . In 2007 , we tested it .
And we have tested it since then over the last three years .
And I can tell you , it was a changing experience .
Nobody wants to change their lives .
Because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we do it , we should .
But if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and you &apos;re told , &quot; Get us going . &quot;
The oil that &apos;s out , that &apos;s a fascinating adventure .
It &apos;s the way you go . You can find out how you survive .
Would most of our players have ?
Those in the game would retain the habits that they learned .
So we &apos;ve chosen to go for the next world saving game .
A bigger , higher goal than just oil shortages .
We &apos;ve got the Superstruct game at the Institute for the Future .
The starting point is to calculate a supercomputer that people only have 23 years left to do on the planet .
This supercomputer is called the Global Dismortality Sensitization System .
Of course , the call to players to sign up .
Do we have almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie ?
You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies , where it &apos;s the dream team .
You have the astronaut , the scientist , the ex @-@ Sträfling , and only together can you save the world .
But in our game , instead of just five people , we say , &quot; Everyone &apos;s on the dream team . &quot;
And it &apos;s our job to build the future for energy , food , health , safety and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played this game .
Eight weeks .
They found 500 incredible .
Creative solutions that they can read .
If you Google Superstruct and the last game bring us to the 3rd of March .
It &apos;s a game in collaboration with the World Bank .
If you play the game , you get from the World Bank the award of social transformers 2010 .
We work with universities all over Sub @-@ Saharan Africa .
And invite them to redesign social . Learn to redesign .
We have a comic book on this .
We have levels high for regional .
Understanding knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
I want to invite you all .
This game with young people to share .
Everywhere on Earth , especially in the development areas , that benefit from this , they come together .
Their own social enterprise to imagine the world , to save the world .
I &apos;m going to finish now .
I want to ask you something : What do you think is happening ?
Next , we have all these fantastic players .
We have games that show us .
What we can do , but we have the real world yet to save .
Well , I hope you will tell me that players agree that human resources are .
We are working at real life work .
And that games are important for us to change .
We have all these superpowers : Happy productivity .
The ability to have tight social networks , urgency optimism and desire for epiepical meaning .
I really hope that together we can have important games to play together on this planet , another century to survive .
And I hope you will join me in playing these games .
And play when I move into the next decade .
I &apos;m going to be sure about two things : That we &apos;re going to be able to create any imaginable future .
And that we &apos;re going to play all kinds of games .
So I &apos;m going to say , let &apos;s play the world @-@ changing games .
Start .
Thank you .
For some time now , I &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect .
It may seem strange that a game magician is interested in this .
It &apos;s unless you look at it like me , as a deception .
Those who are becoming something real when someone is just stuck enough to believe in it , in other words , have sugar pills .
In some studies , a measurable effect has been shown to be the placebo effect , and that &apos;s just because of it .
Because the person thinks what to do with it is .
A pharmaceutical or some kind of in pain management , for example , if the patient is only firmly enough to get into it , there &apos;s a measurable effect in the body that &apos;s called the placebo effect .
A deception becomes something real because it &apos;s something real because somebody perceives it so that we can understand each other .
I &apos;m going to give you a basic , very simple magic trick .
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works .
This is a trick that has been around for at least the 1950s in every children &apos;s magic book .
I myself have taken it from the Cub Scout Magic .
The scout scout in the 1970s , I &apos;m going to learn it for you .
And then explain it and then I &apos;m going to explain why I explain it .
So you see what happens .
The knife .
That you can study , my hand , that you can examine .
I &apos;m going to just put the knife in my fist like that .
I &apos;m pushing my sleeves back and to make sure that nothing in my sleeves disappears or disappears from it , I &apos;m going to do it .
I &apos;m just going to push my wrist right here , so you can see that this is not the way anything is moving at any time .
As long as I &apos;m pressurizing here , nothing can go in my sleeve or come out .
And the goal is , quite simply .
I &apos;m going to open my hand .
And hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife will go through my bare physical magnetism .
It &apos;s actually so firmly stuck in its place that I can shake it .
Without that knife falling down , nothing moves into my sleeve or comes out .
No trickery .
And you can study everything .
TA @-@ DA :
Now , this is a trick I often use to teach small kids .
They who are interested in magic , because you can do a lot about deception .
If you look more closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick to do .
I think many of you here probably know .
This trick , it works .
Here &apos;s how I hold the knife in my hand .
I say I &apos;m holding my wrist around to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or comes out , and that &apos;s a lie of lies . The reason I &apos;m holding my wrist is because of this .
The fact that it &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
In the moment that I &apos;m talking about my hand turning away from you so that you can see it from behind , this finger moves .
Here &apos;s my index finger just from where it was .
Put it in a position where it &apos;s so stretched out . Great trick .
There &apos;s somebody sitting behind there who had no childhood , so he &apos;s here .
Right ? And if I turn around , the finger changes its position , and now you could talk about it .
Why ?
One deception is why you don &apos;t perceive that here down here , only three fingers are visible , because the reason is there , and the way that he processes information .
They &apos;re not counting individually .
One , two , three , but seeing them as a group .
But that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about .
Now , actually , not at all .
And then open .
I mean , hand .
Of course , it &apos;s being held there .
But not by magnetism of my body , but by a trick , by my index finger , which is there now .
And if I put my hand in , the same thing happens by turning back .
By this movement , it &apos;s hidden that the finger is moving back .
I take this hand away , and here &apos;s the knife .
This trick you can use to get your friends and neighbors to perform .
Thank you .
Now , what does this have with the placebo effect ?
Well , a year ago or so , I read a study that really bypassed me , really .
I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that &apos;s why it was for me .
An amazing thing .
It &apos;s actually this .
It turns out that if you have a placebo in the form of a white pill , you can do it .
In the form of an aspirin tablet , it &apos;s simple .
A round white pill that has a certain measurable effect .
But if you have the shape in which you have placebo , to give placebo , for example , to a smaller pill , change it .
And this blue color and a letter on it is the color of measurement , actually more effective .
And that , even though none of them are any pharmaceutical , they &apos;re just sugar pills .
But a white pill is not that good as a blue pill .
What that made me really freak out of it .
It turned out , however , that this hasn &apos;t all happened yet .
If you take capsules , they &apos;re even more effective than tablets .
Any shape , a colored capsule , that &apos;s yellow at one end .
And on the other side , red is better than a white capsule .
The dosage also plays a role .
A pill twice a day is not so good as three pills .
I can now &apos;t get to the exact statistics .
Remember , I &apos;m sorry .
The key thing .
But is that the dosage also has a role to play ?
And the shape plays a role .
And if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to grab the needle .
Right ?
A syringe with an ineffective one .
A few milliliters , an ineffective substance , you can inject into a patient .
That creates a very strong image .
In the head , that &apos;s much stronger than a white pill .
This graph is really .
I &apos;m going to give you another time .
If we have a projector , so the fact is , the white pill isn &apos;t so good as the blue pill , it doesn &apos;t work .
It doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule .
It doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
And none of this has any really pharmaceutical property .
It &apos;s just our belief in it that &apos;s inside us stronger effects .
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a magic trick .
I &apos;m taking something that obviously is a deception .
And let it look real .
We know from that study that we can say you can grab a needle .
If it &apos;s going to get to the point , this is a 18 @-@ inch @-@ long needle .
It &apos;s very , very sharp .
And I &apos;m going to start by doing a little sterilizing it .
This is really my flesh .
It &apos;s not Damian &apos;s special farmed meat .
This is my skin .
This is not a special effect .
Hollywood . I &apos;m going to now use this needle to stick it into my skin .
And through it , I &apos;m going to push it up to the other side to get out of it .
If you &apos;re going to get bad , if you &apos;re just going to faint .
I have this a couple of friends .
Last night in the hotel room .
And some people I &apos;m not familiar with .
And there &apos;s a woman almost faintly fainted .
I &apos;m suggesting , if you &apos;re quick to get sick , look for the next few 30 seconds away , or you know what ?
I &apos;m going to take the first delicate part .
Here in the back , you can see it in a moment .
You can see it also if you want .
So , it &apos;s so accurate .
Here &apos;s where my meat starts .
Down at the bottom of my arm , I &apos;m just going to make a little bit of a break .
Do I really regret ?
Do you do that ?
Crazy .
And now .
Just a little bit .
By my skin and on the other side , again , out .
Now we &apos;re actually in the same situation .
We &apos;re in the knife trick , about , but now you can &apos;t count my fingers .
Or ...
So I &apos;m going to show you .
This is one , two , three , four , five .
Well , I know what people are thinking .
If you see that , you say , &quot; Okay . &quot;
This is certainly not so stupid .
And it &apos;s self @-@ stifling , just to give us a few minutes to entertain for us .
Well , then I &apos;ll show you .
What does that look like ?
Here &apos;s pretty good .
Yes .
I know .
And people in the back say , okay .
I have not really seen that .
People in the adjoining rooms are now coming in .
Let &apos;s let me tell you .
Close up , this is really my skin .
This is not a special effect .
Hollywood .
This is my flesh .
And I can turn this around .
I &apos;m sorry if you get bad .
Look away .
Look away .
Don &apos;t look at it . People in the back , or those who later .
Sometime , on video , you &apos;ll say , &quot; Well , this looks pretty good . &quot;
Impressive .
But if it were real , he would see .
You &apos;re here : A hole .
And there , if it was really real , it would bleed .
Okay .
Let me just take a little blood for you .
Yeah , here it is .
Normally I would now squeeze out the needle .
I would take my arm out .
And show you that there are no wounds there .
But I think in this frame here and with the intention of getting out of a deception something real , real .
Will I take the needle out ?
There , leave it in .
And so , from the stage , we &apos;ll go into the next few days , and we &apos;ll meet again a few times .
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that .
Thank you very much .
So I &apos;ve got a lot of fish in my life .
I &apos;ve only loved two .
This first one , that was more like a passionate affair .
It was a beautiful fish , tasty , good consistency , rich .
A bestseller on the menu .
What a fish .
Better yet .
It got aquaculture after aquaculture , supposedly the highest standards of sustainability , bred .
You could , therefore , feel comfortable with it selling it .
I had this beauty in my relationship with several months of a day , one day the boss of the company called and asked if I was growing up at an event .
About sustainability of the farm .
Of course , I said , &quot; Here was a company .
Those who tried to solve what this unimaginable problem was .
For our chefs , how do we keep fish on our food menus in our last menu for the last 50 years ?
We , the oceans , have fished how we &apos;ve beaten forests bare .
It &apos;s hard to destroy .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the cures , the salmon , the swordfish .
They &apos;ve collapsed .
It &apos;s almost nothing left .
So I think it &apos;s going to be aquaculture , or bad aquaculture , fishing .
Part of our future .
A lot of arguments against it , fishing facilities pollute the environment , most of them anyway .
And they &apos;re inefficient .
Let &apos;s take tuna , a big disadvantage .
It has feed recovery of 15 percent to one .
That means 15 pounds of wild fish are needed .
So you need one pound of farmed tuna , not very sustainable tastes .
Nor does it taste very good .
So here was finally a company that tried to get it right .
I wanted to support them .
The day before the event , I called the head of public relations for the company , and I call them .
We call him Don Don , and I just said , &quot; Just for the facts . &quot;
Right ?
I have to say , &quot; You &apos;re famous for that . &quot;
So far out in the sea , you grow the environment so that you don &apos;t pollute .
That &apos;s true , &quot; he said .
&quot; We &apos;re so far out there that the waste from our fish is distributed .
Not concentrated . &quot;
And then he added .
&quot; We &apos;re basically our own world .
This feed recovery of 2.5 to 1 &quot; he said , &quot; The best in the industry . &quot;
2.5 to .
One great 2.5 to .
One thing that feeds ?
Your sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; Great , &quot; I said , &quot; and that evening I lay in bed .
And I thought , &quot; What the hell is a sustainable protein ? &quot;
So I called the next day .
Shortly before the Don event .
I said , &quot; Don , what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
He said , &quot; He doesn &apos;t know . &quot;
He &apos;ll ask .
Well , I telephoned with a couple of people in the company .
Nobody could tell me a good answer .
Until I finally got to the leading biologist , we call him the Don Don , too . &quot; I said , &quot; What , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
Well , he mentioned some algae and some fishmeal , and then he said , &quot; Chicken pellets . &quot; I said , &quot; Chicken pellets . &quot; He said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Feathers , skin , bone meal .
Remnants dried .
And to feed processed .
I said , &quot; How much percent of your food is chicken ? &quot; Assuming maybe two percent ?
Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , he said .
I said , &quot; Don . &quot;
&quot; What &apos;s sustainable about this ? &quot;
&quot; Chicken to feed fish ? &quot;
There was a long break in the pipeline and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just a lot of chicken on the world . &quot;
I fell in love with this fish .
No .
Not because I was a righteous connoisseur .
And good man , that &apos;s me , even .
No .
I &apos;m not really impressed by this fish , because I swear by God , the fish after this conversation , after chicken tasted chicken .
This second fish , this is another species of love story .
It &apos;s the romantic species , the species where you ever ever better ...
You know your fish , you get to know the fish , the more you love it .
I have it first in a restaurant in southern Spain .
A friend journalist had long been talking about this fish .
She has kind of cuffled us .
He came up on the table with a bright , almost shimmering white color .
The chef had cooked it .
Hold twice . Amazingly , he was still delicious .
Who can buy a fish ?
So good .
Taste .
Let it taste after it &apos;s cooked . I can &apos;t .
But this guy can call it .
We can call it Miguel .
In fact , he &apos;s called Miguel .
And no .
He has the fish not cooked .
And he &apos;s not a chef .
At least in the way you and I are understanding it .
He &apos;s a biologist at Veta la Palma .
This is a fish rearing in the southwest corner .
Spain , it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
Guadalquivir , right up to the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of Argentines .
They grew meat cattle on what was basically wetlands ,
They did that by doing the land drainage .
They built this complicated sequence of canals .
And they pushed water out of the country .
And out into the river .
Well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not economically .
And ecologically , it was a disaster .
It brought about 90 percent of the birds around , which is what a lot of birds are for this place .
And so 1982 , a Spanish company with environmental awareness .
The country bought , what did they do ?
They bought the river of water in reverse .
They literally have the lever .
Instead of pushing out the water , they used the channels to do it .
The water was pulling in again .
They flooded the channels .
They created an 11,000 acres of fish farming , perch , sea ash , shrimp , eel .
And in doing so , Miguel and his company have completely destroyed the environment .
The farm is incredible .
I mean , they have something like this never seen before .
They &apos;re staring out onto the horizon , which is a million miles away .
And everything they see is flooded . Channels .
And this density , lush march , I was there , not long ago , with Miguel .
He &apos;s an incredible guy .
Three parts : Charles Darwin .
And one part : A crocodile for kissing .
Okay .
There we were .
And we fought through .
The wetlands and I chastise .
And sweat has mud up to my knees .
And Miguel keeps calm .
A biology lecture .
Here he lifts a rare track car .
Now mentioned .
He mentions the mineral needs of phytoplankton , and here he sees a pattern of bundles .
That &apos;s what he calls the Tanzanian giraffe .
Does it look like it turns out Miguel is the majority of his career in Mikumi National Park in Africa , where he spent the most of his career in Mikumi National Park ?
I asked him how he was going to be a fish expert .
He said , &quot; Fish , I don &apos;t know about fish .
I &apos;m an expert in relationships .
And then he goes . &quot;
And he crashes into more talk of rare birds and algae and algae .
And strange aquatic plants , and you don &apos;t get me wrong .
That was really fascinating .
You know , the biotic community , unplugged .
So , in the way it &apos;s great .
But I was in love .
And my head got weak over this cooked piece of delicious fish .
The me on the eve , so I got him interrupted .
I said , Miguel .
How is it that your fish is so tasty ?
He pointed to algae .
I know boy , the algae of phytoplankton , the relationships .
That &apos;s incredible .
But what do your fish eat ?
How is the recycling of feed ?
Well , he goes on .
I tell you that it &apos;s such a rich system that it &apos;s the fish eating what they eat in the wild , what they would eat .
The vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton -- that &apos;s what the fish feed .
The system is so healthy .
It &apos;s completely self @-@ explanatory .
There &apos;s no food .
The way a farm owns its own animals is that it doesn &apos;t feed its animals .
Later on the day , I drove on this plot with Miguel .
And I asked him , &quot; I said , for a place that &apos;s so natural , it seems different from any farm on which I ever have been .
How do you measure success ?
In the moment , it was as if a film director was demanding a stage change . &quot;
And we bowed around the corner .
And we got the most incredible sight .
Thousands and thousands of pinkers , flamingos , literally pinker carpet .
So far as the eye can see .
This is success .
He said , &quot; Look at their bellies . &quot;
Pink , they &apos;re slugging .
Sludge .
I was completely confused .
I said Miguel .
Sludge not your fish .
Yeah .
He said ,
&quot; We &apos;re losing 20 percent of our fish .
And fish eggs to birds . &quot;
Well , last year , on this plot , 600,000 birds were there .
More than 250 different species .
It &apos;s today the largest .
And one of the most important private bird reserves in Europe .
I said , &quot; Miguel is a good thing .
A thriving bird population , not .
The last one . &quot;
You can see this in a fish farm . He shook his head .
No .
He said , &quot; We &apos;re building extensively , not intensively .
This is a green network .
The flamingos eat the shrimps , the shrimps eat the phytoplankton .
The closer the belly , the better . &quot;
The system : Okay .
Let &apos;s do a rethink .
A farm that has no feeding of its animals .
And a farm that has been successful in health at the predators &apos; health .
A fish rearing .
But also a bird reserve .
Oh .
And by the way , these flamingos shouldn &apos;t even be there from the outset .
They breed in a city , 240 kilometers away , where the soil is better .
For nest maintenance every morning , they fly 240 kilometers to the farm .
And every night , they fly 240 kilometers .
Back .
They do that .
Because they &apos;re the white line of the A92 highway that you can follow yesterday .
Seriously .
I had a kind of journey that penguins had imagined .
So I looked at Miguel .
I said , Miguel , fly 240 kilometers .
The farm and fly them .
240 kilometers back .
In the evening , they do that for the kids .
He looked at me as if I had just heard a song from Whitney Houston .
He said , &quot; No , they do that because the food is better . &quot;
I don &apos;t have the skin of my beloved fish mentioned .
The delicious was , and I don &apos;t like the skin of fish .
I like it .
I sucks . I don &apos;t like it .
It &apos;s crispy . It &apos;s this biting , charred taste .
I cook almost never with it .
And yet , when I put it in this restaurant in southern Spain , she even did not look for fish skin .
She tasted sweet .
And in it , as if you were eating a bite from the ocean .
I mentioned that to Miguel .
And he nodded .
He said , &quot; The skin looks like a sponge .
It &apos;s the last defense .
Before anything happens in the body , it has become more and more evolutionary , to develop impurities to suck in , and then he added . &quot;
But our water doesn &apos;t have impurities .
Okay .
A farm .
They have no fish feeding .
A farm .
They have a farm measuring their success in the success of their predators , and then I realized .
If he says , &quot; A farm that doesn &apos;t have impurities , it undermines enormously . &quot;
Because the water that goes through this farm comes from the farm from the Guadalquivir River .
It &apos;s a river that &apos;s all the things with it .
Of those rivers today , they tend to have it with them .
Chemical pollutants , outflow of pesticides , and if it goes through the system , and it &apos;s leaving , it &apos;s the water that &apos;s cleaner than it &apos;s come in .
The system is so healthy .
It cleans the water .
So not only a farm that &apos;s cleaning its animals .
Not only a farm that is successful at the health of its predators , but also a farm that literally measures a water treatment plant .
And not only for these fish , but also for you .
And me , because if the water flows out , it sinks into the Atlantic , a drop in the ocean .
I know , but I take it , and you should take it .
Because this love story , however romantic , is also instructive .
You might say that it &apos;s a recipe .
For the future , good food , whether we &apos;re from beef or meat cattle .
What we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , of a farm in which food is .
In fact , taste good .
But for many people , this is a little too radical .
We &apos;re not realists .
We enjoy , we &apos;re lovers .
We love weekly markets .
We love small family businesses .
We talk about regional food .
We eat organic food , and if you claim that &apos;s what things are that are the future of good food , it &apos;s there .
Someone somewhere up and says , &quot; Hey guys , I love pink .
Flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
How are you going to feed the world ?
Can I be honest .
I like this question .
No .
Not because we &apos;ve already produced enough calories to feed the world more than just feed the world .
One billion people today will starve .
One billion .
That &apos;s more than ever because of the stark inequalities in the distribution , not total production .
Well , I like this question not because it &apos;s the logic of our food system , the last 50 years , that has been determining .
Feed grain to vegetable eaters .
Pesticides to monocultures , chemicals .
The Earth chicken to fish and the whole time has the logic of the agricultural industry just asked .
If we have more people eating cheaper , how horrible can that be ?
That was the reason .
It was the justification .
It was the business plan of American agriculture .
We should call it .
What it is is a liquidation industry .
A trade that quickly greases green capital .
That &apos;s exactly what this production allows . That &apos;s not a business .
And it &apos;s not agriculture .
Our grain chamber is threatened today .
Not because of decreasing supply , but because of decreasing resources , not because of the latest mowers .
And tractor inventions , but because of fertile land , not by pumps , but by fresh water .
Not by chainsaws , but by forests .
And not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
They want the world to feed .
Let &apos;s start with the question of how are we going to feed ourselves ?
Or better .
How can we create conditions ?
Which each community can empower itself to feed in order to feed itself .
Look , don &apos;t look at the agricultural industrial model for the future .
It &apos;s really old .
And it &apos;s done : Capital , chemistry .
And machines are on top of it , and it never has really good things .
It &apos;s produced for food , and instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
This is the one that &apos;s on two billion years of work experience .
Look at Miguel .
Farmers like Miguel . Farms .
They don &apos;t have worlds for themselves . Farms that restore .
Instead of using up farms that grow extensively , instead of just intensive farmers , who are not just producers , but experts in relationships .
Because they are the ones who are experts on taste .
And if I really am honest , they are a better cook than I am ever before .
You know , that &apos;s right for me .
Because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
Thank you .
I grew up with a lot of science fiction , in my school days .
I went by bus to school every day .
One hour per way .
And my nose was always in one book , a science fiction book .
That was my thoughts into other worlds .
And narratives . My deep into the me , insatiable curiosity , satisfied .
This curiosity was also shown by the fact that whenever I was not in the school , I was always , through the woods , wandering .
And sampled frogs .
And snakes .
And beetle
And pond water , bringing everything home .
And under the microscope , I looked at it , I was totally science @-@ excited .
You know , it always was about the attempt to make the world understand .
And the limits of what is possible , and my love of science fiction seemed to be in my surroundings .
Because back then , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon .
And we explored the deep sea .
Jacques Cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating shows , which brought us animals .
And places and a world full of wonders , which we showed ourselves never before imagined .
This then probably has a very good time with that science fiction role .
And I was an artist .
I could draw .
I could paint , and because it &apos;s neither video games nor this saturation with computer @-@ generated movies , nor the whole visual language .
In the media landscape , I had to give the pictures in my head .
That &apos;s what we all had to do at the time .
If we were kids , we read a book , we took the author &apos;s description and projected it .
They projected it on the canvas in our heads .
My reaction to that was drawing and painting of aliens .
Aliens worlds , robots , spacecraft and so on .
What in math class I was constantly taught by the teacher .
How I got hidden in the textbook , painted around , the creativity had to sort of get out of it .
And it was an interesting thing .
What actually happened to me about Jacques Cousteaus &apos; shows was the idea of a totally us unknown world .
Here on our planet .
Even certainly I would never have a foreign world with an alien ship , I would never reach .
That seemed pretty unlikely to me .
But here was a world I was actually entering .
Here on Earth .
And it was just as fascinating .
And exotic as all of that .
What I always imagined was when I was looking at these books , I read them .
So I decided when I was 15 , when I was a diver .
The only problem with this was that I was in a small village in Canada , one thousand kilometers from the nearest ocean , I lived in a small village .
And I let myself be away from this .
But I didn &apos;t discourage .
I was annoying my father until he finally got a diving school in Buffalo , New York , and he was finding it .
And that &apos;s exactly the other side of the border where we lived .
I made my diving certificate in a pool of YMCA , right in winter in Buffalo , New York .
The ocean .
But a real ocean I got only two years later , two years later .
When we went to California , since then , in the 40 years that have passed , I &apos;ve got about 3,000 hours under water , and I &apos;ve been living there for about three thousand hours .
500 hours of that in submersible boats , and I &apos;ve learned that the deep sea world itself is in the flatter oceans .
So rich in fascinating life as rich as we are in really little imagined .
Imagination of nature knows no boundaries . It &apos;s quite unlike nature &apos;s own miserable human life imagination .
Until now , it &apos;s been my deepest awe for what I feel about my dives .
And my love of the ocean continues with the same intensity .
As ever .
And ever as I got to be an adult , I chose a profession , it was filmmaking .
That seemed the best way to make my inner urge to tell stories .
With my need to make pictures , to unite when I was a kid , to draw .
I kept drawing comic books , and so on , so films were the way .
Pictures and stories , bringing together , that fit .
Together .
Of course , the stories I was choosing were from the science fiction field , Terminator Aliens .
And Abyss at Abyss , I could put my preference for the underwater world and diving with the filmmaking , and I could connect it to the filmmaking .
So the entanglement of my two passions is kind of intertwined .
Something interesting happened at Abyss to make a narrative problem in this movie , to solve .
And that was , we had to do something like create a liquid water system , grab .
We were using computer @-@ generated animation CG .
What came out of this was the first computer @-@ generated soft surface figure .
The one ever in a movie to be seen was the film , which didn &apos;t bring money , and in fact it played .
He just played his production costs .
But I noticed something fascinating .
The audience on the planet was a bit hypnotized .
The magic of the one that was thought to be Arthur Clarke &apos;s law , as you know , advanced technology and magic are no longer to be distinguished from each other .
They saw something magical .
And that &apos;s what I found incredibly exciting .
And I thought , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s absolutely what film art has to be involved in .
So we went to Terminator 2 , my next movie .
A lot further along with ILM , we created .
We created the guy there of liquid metal , and that success was hanging .
It was quite a success .
How about this effect would arrive ?
And it worked .
Again , we had created something magical .
And the effect in the audience was the same .
But we did , with the film , have a little more money , a little bit more money , from these two experiences .
And starting with this , we had a whole new world .
We had a whole new world of creativity for filmmakers .
So I started a company together with my good friend Stan , and I started it .
Winston , who was at that time the best make @-@ up and creature designer , called Digital Domain .
The basic idea of this company was to start the phase of analog processes with optical printers , etc . , and to jump over to digital productions .
And we did .
And we did , and we did , for a while , a competitive advantage .
But in the mid @-@ 1990s , we realized that we were in the Creature and Character Design , for which we actually founded the company .
Too slowly , I had this piece Avatar written .
This is the benchmark for visual effects .
And computer @-@ generated effects are coming to new heights , with realistic , human expressive characters .
They &apos;re made using CG , and they &apos;re supposed to be all CG .
And the world should be CG .
But the benchmark pressed pretty much back .
And people in my company said , &quot; I think for the time being , we haven &apos;t been able to do that .
That &apos;s how we did it . &quot;
So I postponed that . And I made this other movie about the big ship .
That goes to the studio , I did that as Romeo and Juliet on a ship , and I sold it to the studio .
It became a love film of epic proportions , a passionate film , in secret .
But did I actually want to become a real wreck ?
The Titanic , dip down , so I made the film .
This is the truth .
The studio knew this .
But not me . I have it .
But convinced by saying , &quot; We dive to the wreck . &quot;
We film the real wreck .
We will do it in the opening sequence of the film .
This is incredibly important .
It &apos;s a good trailer for marketing .
And I persuaded you to make an expedition finance .
Sounds crazy .
But that &apos;s okay again .
That &apos;s because your imagination is a reality that can create .
We then actually created six months later a reality in which we created a reality in which I was found in a Russian submersible .
Four kilometers below the surface of the North Atlantic and me , the real Titanic , through a bullet .
This was not a movie .
No HD .
This was real .
So , this really bypassed me .
And the preparations for this were enormous .
We had to have cameras and headlights and everything .
And I fell on how much these deep @-@ sea dive gears resembled a space mission .
Well , they were also high @-@ tech .
And they needed extensive planning .
You go up into this capsule .
Then you float into this dark , hostile environment , where no hope for salvation exists , you float down .
If you don &apos;t return it yourself and I thought to myself , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s the same as if I were in a science fiction movie . &quot;
That &apos;s really cool .
I was really obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
Anyway , from the part that was curious and science to do with it .
It was all .
It was adventure .
It was curiosity .
It was imagination .
And it was an experience that I had not had Hollywood experience .
Because , you know , I could be imagined as a creature for which we would then have a visual effect .
But I could not imagine that . What I could imagine outside the window was what I would see .
Some of the expeditions that followed , I have entities in thermal springs .
And sometimes things that I &apos;ve never seen before , I &apos;ve seen before .
Sometimes things that are still not at all seen before .
And for those who have science at the time we saw it .
Even no words found at all , that made me really right to turn it around .
And I wanted more , and so I met a little bit unusual decision .
After success of Titanic , I said to myself , &quot; Okay .
I want to be my main profession as a filmmaker . &quot;
Hollywood at ice . And I &apos;m going to be a full @-@ time researcher for a while .
And then we started these expeditions to plan .
We showed up to Bismarck .
And we explored them with robotic vehicles .
We went back to the wreck .
The Titanic .
We took small robots that we built that we had .
They had a fiberglass cable , and our intention was to dive in .
And that inside of the ship , looking at what never before has been done .
Nobody had ever had the inside of the wreck explored .
You had not had the means to do that .
So we developed the technology we needed .
So , what ?
There I am now sitting on the deck .
The Titanic .
In a submersible boat , and I see planks planking these boards quite similar here .
And of those I know once that the band there was playing ,
And I &apos;m flying with a little robot vehicle through the aisles of the ship .
I &apos;m operating it , but I &apos;m actually only conscious of it inside the vehicle .
It felt like it was like I was physically inside the ship wreck of the Titanic .
That was the surreal form of a déjà vu .
I &apos;ve ever experienced that , because before I was asked for a corner , I knew I &apos;d always .
What &apos;s going to happen in the light cone of the vehicle , because I had walked over the movie set for months .
When we watched the film , the set was a precise set , a copy of the ship &apos;s blueprints .
This was a very strange experience , then .
She made me this telepresence experience realize that you could have such robotic avatars .
And so , your consciousness into that vehicle , into that other form .
Existence shifts can move . It was really incredibly profound .
And maybe also a little view of it .
What might be in a few decades , maybe .
If you have cyborg bodies to do some research or other things to do .
In all sorts of post @-@ human future scenarios that I imagine as a science fiction fan .
After these expeditions , we started what we were down there seeing .
Really ?
Prevalues to learn .
For example , these deep sea equals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals .
These are , like , aliens .
But here on Earth .
They live with the help of chemosynthesis .
They don &apos;t exist in sunlight .
How do we do that ?
And this is how you see animals right next to a 500 degrees centigrade .
Hot water cloud live .
And you can &apos;t imagine that you &apos;re there to survive .
Same time , I was also interested in being a space scientist .
This was again the science fiction influence from my childhood .
And so I ended up with people who were interested in the space world .
And those with NASA , I was interested in space , and they were in NASA &apos;s expert council planning real space missions .
They &apos;re going to Russia .
They &apos;re going through the biomedical protocol and everything they need to do .
Then they go to the International Space Station and they take our 3D camera systems .
This was fascinating .
But at the end of the day , it was that I was going to be a space scientist with us in the deep sea .
I took them with me and I was going to give them access to the world .
Down there , astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were in the interest of such extreme situations .
I took them to the sources with me so that they could look around , take samples and test instruments .
And so on .
We turned documentary films , but we actually did science .
More specifically , space science , so the circle between my existence as a science fiction fan closed .
Back then , when I was a kid and I was a reality .
Over the course of this discovery journey , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot about science , a lot .
But I also learned a lot about leadership .
Now , you probably think a director must also be able to lead .
A leader like a ship captain or something .
I understood , but not much about leadership .
Before I started these expeditions , because I was at a certain point , I had to tell myself , &quot; What am I doing ? &quot;
Actually , here .
Why am I doing this ?
What &apos;s coming out of this ?
These stupid movies bring us no money .
One : We &apos;re just playing the production costs .
One of fame , no trace .
Everybody thinks I &apos;m between Titanic and Avatar .
Walked away and would have somewhere nails on a towel on a beach ,
I &apos;ve all made these movies .
These documentary films for a very small audience .
No fame , no honor .
No money .
What do you do ?
You do it around the task for the sake of the challenge .
And the ocean is the most challenging environment that exists .
You do it of exploratory noise .
Because of and because of the strange connection that emerges when a small group of people , a team , forms .
Because we have all of this with just 10 to 12 people , we &apos;ve done it .
They &apos;ve been working together for years , and sometimes we &apos;ve been two to three months in a row at sea .
And in this community , you can see that the most important thing is respect , the respect that you have for each other .
Because you have a task to do .
You don &apos;t explain it to anyone else if you go back to land .
And you say , &quot; We had to do it . &quot;
The fiberglass , the sound attenuation .
And that &apos;s all around .
The whole technique .
And the difficulties .
The human power .
If you &apos;re working at sea , you can do it to the other person .
That &apos;s like policemen or policemen , or soldiers who have something in common .
And they know they never have somebody explaining it .
And there &apos;s a connection .
There &apos;s mutual respect . So when I came back to my next movie , Avatar , I tried to apply the same leadership style , which is that you respect your team .
And you know , in return , deserve the respect , and that really changed the dynamics .
And I stood there again with a little team , unknown .
And we turned Avatar with a new technology that it used to be , and it didn &apos;t exist before .
It was incredibly exciting , it was a tremendous challenge .
And we became a huge challenge for a period of four and a half years , and we became a real family .
And that changed my way of making films .
Completely , there were people who thought we had these ocean properties , yeah , really well @-@ replicated , and we were transporting them to Pandora .
For me , it was more a principled way of doing my job .
The process itself , which results from change , what can you do ? So from all of this , what lessons do you have ?
We learned . I believe , first of all , curiosity .
It &apos;s the most powerful human property .
Our imagination is a force that even has a reality to create .
And respect for your team is more important than all laurels .
This world to me comes with young filmmakers .
They say , &quot; Give me a advice on how to do it . &quot;
This is how to do it .
And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t limit yourself . &quot;
One : Get it .
Others for you .
Do not do it for you .
Self : Bet not against yourself . Bet not against yourself , but take risks . NASA has you .
Such a favorite sentence : Failure is not an alternative .
But in art and in exploration , it must fail . An alternative .
Because there it guarantees a benefit of trust .
No important undertaking .
Innovation demanded was ever realized without risk .
You have to be ready .
Such risks have to be taken .
That &apos;s the idea I &apos;m going to share with you on the way .
Failure is a very alternative . Fear .
But isn &apos;t it ? Thank you .
If I can tell you one thing today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data that we consume is larger . It &apos;s larger than the sum of the pieces that you &apos;re in .
And instead of overloading information , instead of thinking about overloading information , I want you to think about how we &apos;re information .
So , use it to create patterns .
And we &apos;re seeing trends that otherwise don &apos;t become visible .
So what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical death chart , arranged by age .
The program I &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
It &apos;s called Pivot .
And what I &apos;m doing with Pivot is that I &apos;m going to be able to filter for a certain cause of death .
Let &apos;s say accidents .
And immediately I see another pattern , right ?
That &apos;s what emerges , and that &apos;s because in the middle , here , people are most active .
And you over here , you &apos;re most frail .
We can take a step further and go out and sort it out .
The data , then , refresh , and see that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects .
But not for everybody .
If we go further and age @-@ sort , we say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents even occur , the main cause of accidents , which people are worried about , should be .
And who &apos;s going to study , you see , this is particularly true for men .
You see , then , that the image of information and data in this way is very much swimming .
In a vivid information graph , and if we think about this for raw data , why not for content ?
Even what we &apos;re having here is the cover images .
Each and every one of the Sports Illustrated people who have ever been printed .
It &apos;s all here .
It &apos;s all online .
You can like to do it after I &apos;ve been talking in your rooms .
With Pivot , you can dive into a decade .
You can dive into a given year .
You can dive directly to a particular issue .
If I &apos;m looking here , I see the athletes who are in this issue .
And the sports , I &apos;m a Lance Armstrong fan .
So I click here .
What makes me all the spending show me Lance Armstrong mentions .
Now , if I just have a bigger overview , I could think .
OK .
What if I could do everything with the theme of cycling ?
So I &apos;m going to take a step back .
And expand the perspective .
Now I &apos;m looking at Greg Lemon , and so you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , more targeted , wider , zoom in , zoom out , you don &apos;t look for it or surf .
Not easy .
Just you do something .
That &apos;s actually a little different . It &apos;s something in between .
And we think it changes the way that we do information , and it changes the way that it can be used .
I want to start with this idea a little bit more .
It &apos;s something like , what &apos;s a little crazy about what we &apos;ve done here is we have every single wikipedia page .
And you &apos;ve taken it down to a little summary .
The summary contains a quick overview .
And a symbol of the range from where you come from , I &apos;m just going to show the top 500 of the most popular wikipedia pages .
But even in this narrow view , we can see a lot of things .
Immediately , we get an idea of the issues .
Those on Wikipedia are most popular . I &apos;m going to start with the theme of government .
Now , after I &apos;ve elected government , I realize that the Wikipedia categories that are most concerned with this are Time Magazines , people of the year .
This is really important .
Because this is a realization that is not in a single Wikipedia page .
This is just to be seen .
If you take a step back , and look at the whole thing , looking at one of these summaries .
I can then turn to the subject of Time Magazines , &quot; People of the Year . &quot;
Go and everybody together .
See , if I now see all these people , I realize that the majority of them are government officials .
Some of them come from science .
Some even less come from economics .
Here &apos;s my boss .
And one comes from music .
And interestingly , Bono is also a TED Prize winner .
So we can jump now .
And take a look at all the TED Prize winners . You see , we surf the web .
The first time , it &apos;s like it &apos;s really a web , not just from side to side , but a lot more abstract .
And so I want to show you something else .
What a little surprise .
Could I show you here just just the New York Times ? Website .
Pivot : This application .
I want it not to be called a browser .
It &apos;s really not a browser .
But you can use it to look at websites .
And we bring this zoom technology .
Every single website .
Like this .
I can , therefore , take a step back .
And go straight to a specific section .
This is important because you only need to go through looking at websites in this way , and you can do all the Internet history in the same way , looking at the web .
I can , therefore , zoom in into my course , in a certain time frame .
Here &apos;s the state of play of the whole demonstration .
The one that I &apos;ve kept up to this point , and I can sort of do everything I &apos;ve seen so far .
I can bring back again , and if I go out a step and look at everything , I can rearrange my course .
Maybe after my search past .
Here I am , looking for nepotistic .
Here &apos;s Bing , right ?
Here &apos;s live Labs Pivot .
And from here , I can go to the page .
And you can go back to it .
It &apos;s a metaphor that keeps coming to use .
And every time it does the overall picture .
Bigger than the sum of the data pieces right now in this world .
Let &apos;s think that data is a curse .
We talk about the curse of the abundance of information .
We talk about drowning in information .
What if we were to turn this situation around ?
And the Internet on its head .
So , we put it on its head instead of always moving from one to the other .
Start from many things .
A lot of things .
Go to many things .
And then we can see patterns that otherwise would have been hidden .
If we do this , then it will be this data trap that we &apos;ve had so far .
Maybe a new source of meaningful information .
And instead of just just getting information , just moving around , we can get knowledge from it .
And if we know , then we can maybe even learn wisdom from it .
So I stop .
Thank you very much .
Everybody &apos;s talking today about happiness .
I have some people , the number of books counts .
Let those with happiness in the title in the last five years published in the last five years .
And they gave after about 40 , they gave up .
And there were still a lot more .
There &apos;s a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
There &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching .
Everybody would like to make people happier .
But despite all this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps .
They sort of make it almost impossible .
Sure .
About thinking about happiness .
And my talk .
Today , it &apos;s mostly these cognitive traps that will act .
That &apos;s true for laymen .
Those who talk about their own happiness .
And it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness because the turn turns out we &apos;re just as confused .
Like everybody else , the first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity .
It turns out that that word is happiness , just not a useful word anymore , because we &apos;re putting it on too many different things , too many different things .
I think there &apos;s a certain meaning to which we apply it to , you know ?
But in general , it &apos;s a little bit that we &apos;re going to have to give up .
And we &apos;re going to take the complicated view .
We &apos;re going to have to take the second case of well @-@ being .
Is confusion between experience ?
And memory , basically , is between happiness , being happy .
In his life and being happy about his life or being happy .
With his life , and these are two very different concepts and they &apos;re both thrown together .
In the idea of happiness and happiness , and the third is the concentration illusion .
And that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we &apos;re not talking about a circumstance that we can think about .
Well @-@ being affects without affecting its meaning .
I mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive trap .
There &apos;s just no way .
It &apos;s right to get it right .
Now I &apos;d like to take an example from someone who has a question and answer session .
After one of my lectures , which covered a story , he was unclear , he said he &apos;d heard a symphony .
And it was absolutely magnificent .
( Music ) And at the very end of the recording , there was a terrible , creeping sound .
And then he added , &quot; Really , quite emotional . &quot;
This has all the experience ruined .
But that had not .
What it ruined was the memories of the memories of the experience .
He had the experience .
He had 20 minutes .
Great music .
They didn &apos;t count because he had a memory left .
The memory was ruined .
And the memory was everything .
What he was getting to keep , what that really tells us is that we &apos;re talking about ourselves and about others .
In the sense of two kinds of self , there &apos;s a self that is alive .
That &apos;s in the present , and the present knows is capable of the past .
Again , experiencing .
But basically , only the present has it . It &apos;s the living self .
That &apos;s what the doctor is acclaimed . You know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Is it hurting now ? &quot;
When I put it on here , and then there &apos;s a memory self .
And the memory self is that . It &apos;s that that &apos;s counting .
And the story of our lives is maintaining .
And it &apos;s that that the doctor &apos;s addressing is by taking the question of , &quot; How did you last wonder about how you &apos;ve felt , or what was your journey to Albania or something like that ? &quot;
These are two very different units .
The living self and the remembering self .
And the two of them to be confused is part of the uniformity of the term happiness .
Now , the remembering self is a storyteller .
And that really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memories , which is , you know , a fundamental reaction .
It starts immediately .
We don &apos;t just tell stories .
If we remember it , we tell stories , our memory tells us stories .
That means what we &apos;re talking about , what we &apos;re allowed to keep from our experiences , is a story .
And let &apos;s not let you take an example .
There &apos;s an old study .
These are real patients .
They &apos;re suffering from painful procedures . I &apos;m not going to go into detail .
It &apos;s not anymore painful today .
But it was painful .
When this study was done in the 1990s , they were asked to do it every 60 seconds , every 60 seconds .
And here are two patients .
These are their records .
And they &apos;re asked , who of both has suffered more ?
And this is a very simple question .
Patient B clearly has suffered more .
His intestinal reflection was longer .
And every minute of pain , the patient A had patient A , patient B and more .
But now there &apos;s another question :
How much did these patients think they suffered and here &apos;s where there &apos;s a surprise ?
And the surprise is that patient A has a much worse memory of patient A.
As patient B has the stories of intestinal reflections , different , and because a very critical part of the story is .
How it ends and none of these stories is very edifical .
Or great .
But one of them is this : Clear .
But one of them is significantly worse than the other .
And those who are worse were the ones where the pain was all at the end of its peak .
It &apos;s a bad story .
How do we know that ?
Because we &apos;re going to look at these people for their spinal reflections .
And also much later .
How bad was the whole thing ?
Overall , and it was much worse for A than for B in B in memory .
Well , this is a direct conflict between the living self .
And the remembering self from the point of view of the living self , B clearly had a worse time .
Now , what you do with patient A , and we have actually clinical experiments done , actually .
And it &apos;s been done .
And it works .
You could actually do the intestinal reflection of patient A by extending just the tube in it by leaving it without being too much attached to it .
That &apos;s going to make the patient suffer , but only one little bit and much less than before .
And if you do that for a few minutes , you have done it to make the living self of patient A worse off than that .
And you have made it to make the remembering self of patient A much better off than that .
Because now you have patient A , a better story about your experience , given you .
What makes a story look like ?
And that &apos;s true of the stories that memory tells us .
And it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent .
What makes a story look like is upheavals , significant moments and ends .
End is very , very important .
And in this case , the end dominated .
Now , the living self lives his life continuously .
It has moments of experience , one after the other .
And you ask , what happens to these moments ?
And the answer is really simple .
They &apos;re forever lost .
I mean , most moments of our lives , and I have just done that .
You know , the psychological present is considered to be for about three seconds .
What does &quot; you know &quot; mean , in a life , it &apos;s about 600 million of them .
In a month , there &apos;s about 600,000 , most of them of them leave .
There &apos;s no trace .
Most of them will be completely ignored .
Remembering yourself and yet , they get somehow the impression that there is counting to count , that what &apos;s going to happen during these moments of experience .
Our life is , it &apos;s the limited resource that we consume .
While we &apos;re in this world , and how we consume it , it would be .
It would seem important .
But that &apos;s not the story .
Those who remember themselves for us retain it .
So we have the memory self .
And the living self .
And they &apos;re really quite different .
The biggest difference between them is the way they deal with time from the perspective of the living .
Even if they spend a vacation and they have a second week just as good as the second week .
Then there &apos;s a two @-@ week vacation twice as good as a one @-@ week vacation .
That &apos;s how it works .
It doesn &apos;t work at all for the memory .
Even for the memory self , a two @-@ week vacation is .
Hardly better than the one @-@ week holiday , because there &apos;s no new memories added .
You have the story not changed .
And to do that , time is .
Actually , the critical variable that a memory self distinguishes from a living self , time has .
Very little influence on this story .
Now , the memory self makes more than remembering .
And stories to tell .
It &apos;s actually the one .
The decisions are made , because if you have a patient who , let &apos;s say , has two intestinal reflections with two different surgeons .
And decides which one to choose .
So if you want to , then the one who chooses who has the memory that &apos;s less bad is the one who chooses .
And that &apos;s the surgeon who chooses to be selected .
The living self doesn &apos;t have a voice in that choice .
Actually , we don &apos;t choose between experiences .
We choose between memories of experiences and even experiences .
When we think about the future , we think about our future .
Normally not as experiences .
We think about our future .
As anticipated memories , and basically , they can look at that .
You know , as a tyranny of the memory self .
And you can imagine the memory self .
Think as one , which is , as it were , dragging the living self through experiences that the living self doesn &apos;t need .
I have the impression that if we leave , that &apos;s very common , if we leave , that &apos;s what happens .
We make holidays , as far as possible , in the service of the memory .
Even , and that &apos;s a little hard to justify .
I think so .
I mean , how much do I feed ?
We , of our memories , that &apos;s one of the explanations that is for the dominance of the memory self .
And if I think about that , I think about a vacation that we &apos;re going to spend a few years ago in Antarctica .
The one that &apos;s clearly the best vacation I &apos;ve ever had .
And I think relatively often about that relative to how often I have to think about other vacations and I have a probably from my memories of my holidays .
These three @-@ week trips .
I would say about 25 minutes for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
Drilled .
Well , if I ever open the folder with the 600 folders of the images in it , I would have spent another hour .
Now , these are three weeks .
And these are at most one and a half hours .
There it seems to be some disagreement .
Well , I like a little bit extreme .
You know , in this , how little appetite ?
I &apos;m going to be feeding memories .
But even if you have more of it , there &apos;s a real question .
Why do we give memories ?
So much weight .
In the scourge to weight .
The one we give experiences .
So I want you to talk about a thought experiment .
Imagine if you &apos;re going to spend your next vacation .
You know that at the end of your vacation , all your pictures are destroyed .
And you get an amnesty drug .
So you get to nothing , remember nothing .
Now , you would have to choose the same vacation .
And if you had another vacation , you would have a different conflict between your two two species of self .
And you have to think about how you might decide this conflict .
And that &apos;s really not obvious at all .
Because if you want to spend time thinking , you get a response .
And if you want to think about memories , you could have a different answer .
Why ?
We , the vacations , choose .
The ones we choose is a problem .
That is what we face with a choice between the two species of self .
Well , the two kinds of self throw two terms of happiness on .
There are actually two concepts of happiness .
The ones we can apply are one per self .
They can ask , how happy is it ?
The living self .
And then they would ask , how happy are the moments in life of the living survivor ?
Even , and they &apos;re all happiness for moments .
Is it a pretty complicated one ?
Process .
What are the emotions ?
They are the ones that can be measured .
And by the way , we are now able to have a pretty good idea .
Of the happiness of the living self over time .
If you look after the happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
This is not about it .
How happy a person lives .
It &apos;s about how satisfied or happy .
The person is when that person is informed about his or her life .
Very different terms .
Anyone who thinks these terms are not different will be studying happiness , masking .
And I &apos;m one of a lot of researchers about well @-@ being .
Those who are researching happiness long masking long ago , to exactly that kind of thing , the distinction between the happiness of the living self .
And happiness of the remembering self is in the last few years recognized .
And now you &apos;re trying to make the two separate measurements , the Gallup Organization has a global survey of the two , where more than half a million people have asked questions about it .
What they &apos;re asking about their lives .
Think about their experiences .
And there were other efforts in the direction .
In the last few years , we &apos;ve started to think about the happiness of the two kinds of self .
And the main lesson we think we have learned , I think , is that they really are different .
You can know how satisfied someone with their lives is .
And that &apos;s what they really don &apos;t teach you much .
How happy he is .
Life lives .
And vice versa .
Just to give you an idea of the correlation between them .
Correlation is about five percent .
What that means is that if you want to meet someone and you would meet them , you would tell them , &quot; Oh , his father is a two @-@ meter man . &quot;
How much would you know about his height ?
Well , you would know something about his size .
But you know , there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
You have so much uncertainty .
If I tell you that somebody is going to live his life as eight on a scale of 10 .
Do you have a lot of uncertainty about that ?
How happy he is with his survivor ?
Even the correlation is small .
We know something about what happiness is about happiness self .
We know that money is very important , goals are very important .
We know happiness is essentially content , content is content with people who we like , time to spend .
With people we like , there are others that enjoy .
But that &apos;s dominant .
If you do happiness , then , for the two kinds of self to maximize , you will end up with very different things .
So the conclusion from what I &apos;m saying here is that what we &apos;re lucky is really not imagining we should .
As a substitute for well @-@ being , it &apos;s a completely different term .
Now , very briefly .
Another reason for this is that we don &apos;t know how to think about happiness is that we don &apos;t think about the same things .
If we think about life and think about life , and if we actually live , so if you ask the simple question of how happy people in California are , they &apos;re not going to get the right answer .
If you ask that question , think that the people in California are happier than they are .
If you say , &quot; We live in Ohio , &quot; and what happens is that if you talk about the life in California , think about the difference between California and California and other places .
And that difference is , say , in climate .
Well , it turns out climate is not very important for climate to the living self .
And it &apos;s not even very important for the thoughtful .
Even that decides how happy people are .
Now , because the thoughtful self is responsible , you can be ultimately responsible for some people .
At the end , you can move to California , and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track .
What happens to people ?
They go to California , hoping to be happier , in the hope .
Well , their self that lives is not going to get happier .
We know that .
But one thing is going to happen .
They &apos;re going to think they &apos;re happier .
Because if you think about that , you &apos;re going to be reminded of how terrible .
The weather in Ohio was , and you &apos;re going to feel that you &apos;re making the right decision .
It &apos;s very difficult to tell clearly about well @-@ being .
And I hope I &apos;ve got you an idea of how horrible it was to be .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
I have a question for you .
Thank you very much .
Well , when we started thinking a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that it was a pretty interesting result , and I think that &apos;s a very interesting one .
It &apos;s from this Gallup survey . Is that something that you &apos;re sharing with us ?
Can we let it happen because you can now have a few minutes left .
Daniel Kahneman : Sure .
I think the most interesting result .
The one we did in the Gallup survey is a number of people we absolutely don &apos;t know how to find .
We found that in terms of the happiness of the survivor himself .
If we looked at how feelings with the income vary and how it represents , it turns out that under an income of 60 000 dollars , in the year , Americans .
And that &apos;s a very big sample of Americans .
About 600 000 .
But it &apos;s a big representative sample .
Under an income of 600 000 dollars in the year .
About 60 000 .
DK : 60 000 , 60 000 dollars a year , people are unhappy .
And they &apos;re getting increasingly unhappy .
The poorer they get about it .
We , an absolutely flat line .
I mean , I rarely have such flat lines seen .
What &apos;s happening is that money obviously doesn &apos;t get you luck with adventure .
But that lack of money certainly gives you misery .
And we can get this misery , very , very clearly measured .
In the sense of the other , even the remembering self , you get a different story .
The more money you make , the more satisfied you are .
That &apos;s not true of emotions .
CA : But Danny , throughout America &apos;s endeavor , it &apos;s about life .
Freedom , the endeavor for happiness .
When people find this finding seriously , I would mean it seems .
Everything on the head seems to be upsetting .
Everything we believe to be , for example , in tax policy and so on .
Are there any chances that politicians , that the country in general , will find a finding like the seriousness ?
And based on that , politics would do DK , you know , I think there &apos;s recognition for the role of gambling research in politics , right ?
Recognition is slowly going to be .
In the United States , no question .
But in the United Kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now .
And in other countries , it &apos;s happening right now .
People are in the process of recognizing that they think of happiness .
If you think about politics , it &apos;s going to take a while .
And people are going to discuss whether you &apos;re going to explore experience happiness .
Or whether you &apos;re going to explore life assessment .
So we need to have this discussion .
Pretty soon , how to increase happiness can be done .
Very different .
Depending on how you think .
And whether you &apos;re thinking about the memory self , or whether you &apos;re thinking about the living self .
That &apos;s going to affect politics .
I think so .
In the years to come , in the United States , you &apos;re tightening on the experience happiness of the population .
That &apos;s what I think will happen in the next decade or two , part of national statistics .
CA : Well , it seems to me that this topic is going to , or should , at least be the most interesting political debate to follow .
About the next few years , thank you very much .
For inventing the behavioral economy .
Thank you .
Danny Kahneman : Today I &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
And that &apos;s surprising .
Maybe something because my full @-@ time job at the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds , about things that are the things that we inventing .
And we need to deliver to the poorest two billion a better life for them .
But energy and climate are extremely important .
For these people , in fact , even more important than for everyone .
For others on the planet , climate degradation means that their seeds will not grow for many years .
It means we &apos;re too much or too little rain .
Things will change that way .
As your fragile environment doesn &apos;t endure ,
That leads to starvation .
It leads to insecurity .
It leads to unrest .
So , climate change is getting terrible for you .
And also , the energy price for you is .
Very important .
The fact is , if you &apos;re just talking about one thing , you could reduce the price , to reduce poverty , energy would be by far the most effective .
Now , the energy price is over time .
In fact , the progress society is based on energy advances , which drove coal evolution , the industrial revolution .
And even in the 20th century , there was a rapid fall in the electricity price , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , air conditioning .
We can use modern materials .
And so many things we do : We are .
So , in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
But if we pay down , we let &apos;s let the price halve , hit .
We get to a new barrier , and that barrier is related to CO2 , CO2 warms the planet .
And the equation for CO2 is actually pretty clear .
They sum up the CO2 emitted , which leads to temperature increase .
And that temperature increase has some very negative consequences .
Effects on the weather .
And maybe worse , the indirect consequence is that natural ecosystems are so rapidly changing that they don &apos;t adapt .
And so whole systems collapse . Well , the exact link between a CO2 increase and the resulting temperature change .
And where their further consequences lie , there are some ambiguities about this .
But not very many .
And there are certainly ambiguities about how bad this impact will be .
But they &apos;re getting to be extremely bad .
I have the top scientists several times asked , &quot; Do we really have to get down to near zero ? &quot;
&quot; Not enough . &quot;
Half or one quarter , the answer is , until we get near zero , we &apos;ll get there .
The temperature will keep rising .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
It &apos;s very different from saying ,
&quot; We have a five @-@ foot truck that &apos;s under a three @-@ meter bridge , and it &apos;s got to come here .
It &apos;s what you can sort of squeeze under it . &quot;
This one has to be downward , to zero .
Well , we run into zero every year .
A lot of carbon dioxide out of over 26 billion tons .
Every American , about 20 tons .
People from poor countries , less than one on average , it &apos;s about five tons for each one on the planet .
And somehow we need to bring about change .
Those that do that to zero .
It &apos;s constant up to now .
Only different economic changes have it ever affected .
And we need to be moved from rapid growth to reduction .
And to reduce to a zero reduction .
This equation has four factors .
A little multiplication .
You &apos;ve got this thing on the left , CO2 .
That you &apos;re going to get to zero .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen to the number of people , to the services that every human being uses on average .
The average energy for every service .
And the CO2 .
That per unit of energy is emitted . So let &apos;s take every factor individually .
And let &apos;s think about how we can get that to zero .
Probably , one of these numbers has to be very close to zero .
Now , this is basic algebra .
But let &apos;s go .
First of all , we have the population .
Today , 6.8 billion people live and it &apos;s screaming at 9 billion , right ?
Those who are at 9 billion , moving .
If we succeed very successfully with new vaccines , healthcare and reproductive medicine , we could do that , maybe by 10 to 15 percent .
But at the moment , we &apos;re seeing a 1.3 percent rise , the second factor is services , the services we use .
That includes everything .
The food we eat , clothing , television , heating -- these are very good things .
And poverty reduction means these services to almost everyone on the planet accessible to them .
It &apos;s great that this number is rising in the rich world , in the top billion , if we could probably make cuts .
And use less , but on average , this number is going to rise every year .
And so overall , it &apos;s more than doubling the number of services per person provided per person .
So here &apos;s a very basic service : Are there at home lights ?
So you can read the homework , and these students have .
It &apos;s not .
So they go out .
And they read .
Their school tasks .
Under the street lights .
Now , effectiveness , the E , the energy per service , finally there &apos;s good news .
We have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
Because of different successes in the lighting sector , because of other types of cars , because of new methods .
In housing , there &apos;s a lot of services that have energy .
They &apos;re able to drastically reduce their energy .
Slashing them can be done .

Some services
Can be reduced by 90 % ?
Some individual services
Can be reduced by 90 % .
Others can be reduced by 90 % by services such as fertilisers ( 105,00 - 05.56,000 GT - 00.05.58.58 000 ) or fertilisers ( 105,00 - 05.56.000 GT - 00.05.58 000 ) or air transport or air transport , and the room for improvement is much smaller .
Overall , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a reduction of a factor 3 or maybe even a factor 3 .
But in the first three factors , we &apos;re now 26 of billion to maybe the very best 13 billion tons , right ?
And that &apos;s just not enough .
Let &apos;s look at the fourth factor , then .
And this one is going to be a key factor .
That &apos;s the amount of CO2 that &apos;s per unit of energy emitted .
It turns out the question is , is that you get that to zero ?
If you burn coal , no , if you burn natural gas , no , almost every method of making electricity .
Today , CO2 emits , except renewable energy .
And nuclear energy , so what we &apos;re doing on a global scale is a new system to create .
We need energy cycles .
If I &apos;m going to use the term &quot; wonder , &quot; I don &apos;t mean .
The impossible , the microprocessor , is a miracle .
The PC is a miracle .
The Internet and its services are a miracle .
People here have become the object of many of these miracles , and they &apos;ve been the source of many of them .
Normally , there &apos;s no deadline for you to do a miracle until you have a certain date .
Normally , you &apos;re just standing next to it .
And some people don &apos;t come to others .
In this case , we have to give full gas .
And a miracle in very short time is now getting . &quot; Well , I wondered , &quot; How can I really get this over ? &quot;
&quot; Is there a natural illustration ? &quot;
A demonstration that shows the idea of the people here .
I remembered the last year , when I was bringing mosquitos .
And somehow , people liked that , the idea became for them really tangible .
You know , it &apos;s people who are with mosquitos living for energy , falling .
I like this one .
I decided that releasing mosquitoes of fireflies would be my contribution this year to the environment here .
Here are a couple of natural fireflies .
You &apos;ve assured me that they &apos;re not biting . They &apos;re actually going to be .
You probably won &apos;t even leave the glass .
Well , there &apos;s all kinds of game solutions like this .
But they bring none of them much .
We need solutions .
Either one or more of them , which are an unimaginable scale and unimaginable reliability .
And though there are many directions , where people are looking for it .
I really see only five of them who are able to meet these big demands .
I have tides , geothermal fusion and biofuels .
They may be doing a moderate contribution , and if they do better than I expect , that would be great .
But my key message here is that we have to work on all those five .
And we can &apos;t do any of them because they intimidate us .
Because everybody has significant problems .
Let &apos;s first look at them .
Burning fossil fuels .
Burning fossil fuels . Burning either coal or natural gas , which you have to do there .
Maybe it just seems .
But that &apos;s not it .
You have to have all that CO2 .
That after burns out of the chimney comes in , captured , under pressure .
Liquid , and then store somewhere .
And hope it &apos;s there .
There are some pilot projects that do that on a 60 / 80 level .
But it &apos;s 100 to get it , very difficult .
And reaching an agreement on storing the CO2 , and reaching an agreement on that , is a big challenge .
But the biggest problem here is the question of storage time .
Who &apos;s going to make sure ?
Who can guarantee something ?
What literally many billions of times larger ?
As any kind of waste you &apos;re dealing with from nuclear and other things , you can imagine .
This is a lot of volume .
This is a hard nut .
Next , nuclear energy , which also has three major problems .
The cost , especially in highly regulated countries , is high .
The question of security , that you really feel that nothing goes wrong , can &apos;t go wrong .
Despite human cooperation , that the fuel is not for weapons , that fuel is not used .
And what do you do ?
Then with the garbage .
Because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concern .
People have to worry about it well .
184.00 , 10 , 20,000 GT , 00 , 10 , 25,000 .
So three very difficult problems .
They might be solvable , so three very difficult problems .
They might be solvable and they might be solvable , and so you should work on them .
The last three of the five I &apos;ve summarized .
They &apos;re renewables . They &apos;re the kind of renewable energy that they &apos;re often called .
And they also have renewables , although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel .
They have some disadvantages .
One is that energy density is the energy density that these technologies generate dramatically lower .
When the power plants -- these are low @-@ energy .
You talk about many square kilometers , thousands of times more space than a normal power plant -- and they &apos;re also subject to .
These sources , interruptions , the sun doesn &apos;t shine all day long .
It also doesn &apos;t shine every day .
And the same way , the wind doesn &apos;t blow all the time .
So you have to , if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , have a way to have the energy even in times .
If you don &apos;t have it available , there &apos;s so there &apos;s a lot of price challenges here .
There are challenges in transmission .
If , for example , we say that the energy source is outside the country , you don &apos;t just need the technology .
You also need to be able to deal with the risk that the energy comes from where it comes from , and there is .
The storage problem .
And to scale the scale , I have been all sorts of different batteries that are manufactured , looking at .
The ones for cars , computers , mobile phones , flashlights for everything , and I &apos;ve been working on the amount of electronic energy that the world uses .
I found that all batteries that are all batteries that we &apos;re now producing now , less than 10 minutes of total energy , are stored .
Could we need to have a big breakthrough here ?
Something that , by a factor of 100 , will be better .
When the approaches are now — this is not impossible .
But it &apos;s not that easy .
This is what happens when you try to find these interrupted sources , say , 20 @-@ 30 percent of consumption .
When you &apos;re 100 percent based on this , you need a tremendous wonder battery .
Now , where are we going to go ?
What is the right approach ?
A Manhattan project .
How do we get to the finish ?
What we need is a lot of companies .
Those who work on it , hundreds in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
Many of them will say , &quot; They &apos;re crazy . &quot;
This is good .
I think here in TED , I think there are many in the group who are already engaged .
Bill Gross has several companies , including one called Esolar , which is a great solar thermal technology .
Vinod Khosla is investing in dozens of companies that do great things .
And interesting opportunities and I &apos;m trying to do that .
Nathan Myhrvold and I are funding a company that , surprisingly , might be taking a nuclear approach .
There are some innovations in the nuclear sector : Modular , liquid , development in this industry .
Some time ago , it stopped , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are lying around .
The Terrapower concept means that instead of a part of the uranium , which is one percent , you have the U235 .
We decided the 99 to burn .
The U238 is a pretty crazy one , right ?
But actually , you had been talking about it for a long time .
But you could never simulate it sensibly .
Whether it would work .
But since it became modern supercomputers , you can simulate it .
And you can see that yes , with the right approach to matter .
It looks like it works and works , and because you can burn those 99 , it &apos;s like this .
The cost profile is much better .
In fact , you burn the garbage , and you can even burn the garbage from today &apos;s reactors .
As a drive , instead of using your head to break down , you just burn it . A great thing .
The uranium is used gradually .
A little bit like a candle .
You can see that it &apos;s a kind of column .
It &apos;s often called a migratory wave , reactor , which really solves it .
The fuel problem .
Here &apos;s a picture of a place .
In Kentucky , this is the waste .
The 99 .
You have the part of the burned today .
Taken out .
So it &apos;s called &quot; Abused . &quot;
Uranium , that shoots .
The U.S. for hundreds of years , at least .
And if you buy ocean water cheap and easy to filter , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet &apos;s life .
You know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges there .
But it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts .
We need them to move forward .
Let &apos;s think about how we can measure our success .
How should our testimony look ?
Well , let &apos;s go to the finish line .
That we need to achieve , and then talk .
We talk about the intermediate step , many talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
It &apos;s really , really important that we get there .
The remaining 20 percent are going to be produced in poor countries , and still some agriculture .
Hopefully , forest threats and cement will .
Until then , clean .
So , around this 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like China , has to .
Their generation of electricity has to completely change .
The other note says , well , if we use zero emissions technology , if they &apos;re in all developed countries .
And we on the way , they &apos;re on the way to getting them to the rest .
That &apos;s super important .
That &apos;s going to be a key element of this product .
If we get back from there , how should that 2020 certificate look ?
It should be back to the two elements .
We should be using the effectiveness measures to reduce the number of things .
The less we emit , the less we emit the CO2 will be .
And so will the temperature .
But actually , this note is for things that we do . It &apos;s not completely too much for the big reductions .
Just equal , or even slightly less important .
Like the others who care about the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
These breakthroughs , we need to track with full @-@ gas .
And that &apos;s what we can measure .
In company numbers , in pilot projects and regulatory changes , there are many great books on this subject .
The Al Gore Book .
We have a choice .
And David McKay &apos;s Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air .
They go it through .
And they create a framework in which this is widely discussed .
Because we need support from everybody for this .
There are some things that need to come together . That &apos;s a wish .
A very concrete wish that we can use this technology .
If you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , let me .
I could give the President a choice : A vaccine , and that &apos;s what I love .
I , or ?
I could choose that wish .
That is half the energy price : Without CO2 , it &apos;s invented .
That wish I would take . This one has the greatest impact .
If we take that wish , it will be the gap between the long @-@ term and the short @-@ term .
People will be horrible between the United States and China , between the poor and rich countries .
And almost all of them live on these two billion , they will be much worse .
What do we have to do ?
What measures do I appeal for ?
We have to work for more research funding .
If countries are in places like coppenhages , countries should not meet just through CO2 , they should talk about it .
They should discuss this innovation strategy .
And they would be shocked by the ridiculously low money that is being spent on these innovative approaches .
We need market incentives . We need carbon taxes . CAP &amp; amp ; Trade , something that sends out a price signal .
We need to spread the news .
We need dialogue , more rational and more complete .
And so do the things that are being done by the government .
It &apos;s an important wish .
But I think we can fulfill it .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Just to get Terrapower a little better .
First of all , you can give us an idea of the scale of this investment .
Bill Gates : To simulate on a supercomputer , all the big scientists , get them .
What we did needs to be done is we need just a few 10 million .
And even if we &apos;re using our materials in a Russian reactor , to make sure that it &apos;s working properly .
Is it just in the 100 million of the hard steps ? Is building the first one reactor ?
Another billion to find the regulariums and the place of the actual place that &apos;s building the first one .
Once the first one is finished , when it &apos;s running as promised , then everything is very clear .
Because the profitability , the energy density , is so different from nuclear energy as we are .
You know about this , right ? To understand .
That means deep .
In the ground , building almost like a vertical .
Pillar of nuclear fuel , this consumed uranium , and then the process starts at the top .
And it continues to work down .
BG : Exactly .
Today , you have to reconnect the reactor .
So there are many people and many controls that go wrong , right ?
Can this thing , where you open it ?
And things in or out ?
This is not good .
If you do , however , have very cheap fuel , you can refill it for 60 years .
Think about a column that you can bury .
Without the whole complexities .
And it sits there .
And it burns for 60 years .
And then it &apos;s done .
CA : A nuclear reactor .
The self @-@ solution for the garbage provides .
BG : Yeah .
Now , what about the garbage ?
You can sit there .
Let &apos;s have a lot less garbage with this method .
Then you take it and grab it in the next reactor , you know .
And you burn it further .
And we start by putting the garbage away .
The one that already exists in these cooling basins or dry tanks at the reactors .
That &apos;s our starting fuel .
So that &apos;s what kind of reactors are facing .
What we &apos;re doing in our fill fill , and that &apos;s dramatically reducing the garbage volume .
During this process , about , but while they &apos;re working with different people around the world on these possibilities .
Where is the biggest ?
Interest , like that .
What really to do ?
BG : Well , we haven &apos;t got to a place yet .
And there &apos;s a lot of interesting disclosure rules for everything .
The nuclear in the name carries it . There &apos;s a lot of interest .
And people in the company were in Russia , India .
China : I was here .
And I have met the energy minister .
And I &apos;ve talked about how this fits into the energy agenda .
I &apos;m optimistic .
You know , the French ?
And Japanese have something in the direction of this .
This is a variant .
One thing that was done is this is an important step forward .
But it &apos;s like a fast reactor .
And some countries have built this .
So everybody who &apos;s building a fast reactor is a candidate for a candidate for our first one .
CA : In your imagination , timeframe and probability .
This is really what you want to create .
BG : Well , we need one of these scalable , power generating things that is very cheap .
We have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to invent , and then to use .
This is kind of the deadline .
Which is the environmental models that have shown us that we have to comply with .
And you know , Terrapower ?
If everything goes well and that &apos;s a big wish , could it ?
It keep it easy , and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds that are the same .
If their approaches work , the promotion of their pilots works .
To do that , and it would be best if there were several .
Because then you could create a mix .
Anyway , you need a solution .
CA : Concerning the big possible breakthroughs , this is the biggest one .
You know that .
BG : An energy break .
Is the most important thing ?
That would be without the environmental challenge .
But the power is still doing so much more important .
In the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
You know , we know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as they do .
But there are the modular methods .
That &apos;s another approach .
There &apos;s a liquid reactor type that &apos;s kind of difficult .
But maybe the ones who say that about us .
And so there are different ones .
But the beauty of that is that a uranium molecule is a million times as much energy as a say .
We , a carbon molecule , and that &apos;s why , when you can deal with the problems , and they &apos;re mainly the radiation of the footprint .
And the cost is the potential .
So the impact on the land and other things , almost in one &apos;s own league .
CA : If that doesn &apos;t work , what do we have to do is take emergency measures to try and keep the Earth temperature stable ?
BG : If you &apos;re in this situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;re eating too much .
And just before a heart attack , what do you do ?
Then you might need a heart surgery or something like that .
There &apos;s a research that &apos;s going on called geoengineering .
It &apos;s going to look at different techniques to treat warming delays .
So that we can take 20 or 30 years longer to get together .
That &apos;s just an insurance method .
You hope that we don &apos;t need that .
Some people say you should not even start thinking about insurance at all because you &apos;re going to be lazy , so you can keep eating , because you know that you &apos;re going to save you from heart surgery .
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart .
If you look at the importance of this problem , but you look at it , there &apos;s a discourse in geoengineering now about whether you can have that at your disposal .
If things get faster or if they get that innovation longer than we expect .
CA : Climate skeptics , do you have one or two sentences for those around ?
You might be persuading .
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
Those who have scientific arguments are very little , say .
They say it has negative effects that are associated with clouds .
Things shift .
There are very , very few things that they say at all .
Of those , there &apos;s a chance in a million .
The main problem here is similar to the one with AIDS .
You make the mistake .
Now , and you pay a lot later .
And so that &apos;s why the idea is , now , if you have all sorts of urgent problems .
In something to invest from that you &apos;re only going to have later on .
And then what &apos;s more , the investment is not so clear .
In fact , the IPCC Report is not necessarily .
The worst scenario .
And there are people in the rich world who are looking at IPCC .
And they say , &quot; Okay , this is not a big drama .
The fact is that this uncertainty gives us cause for concern .
But my dream here is that if you want to make it economically and at the same time eliminate CO2 . &quot;
Then they also say , &quot; Skeptics . &quot;
Okay .
It interests me not that it &apos;s not emitting CO2 .
I wish almost that it did that .
But I &apos;m probably going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method .
CA : And that would be your answer to Björn Lomborg &apos;s argument that if you were to spend all of this time and energy to reduce the CO2 problem , you would have to use it .
All the other goals are suffering because of poverty reduction , the fight against malaria , and so on , that it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources .
Money .
To invest for that .
While it &apos;s better things that we do ,
BG : Well , the actual spending on research , let &apos;s say the U.S. should be 10 billion a year .
Expenditure more than you do today .
That &apos;s not so dramatic .
Underneath that , other things should not suffer .
You come to big amounts of money .
And here , sensible people can contradict .
If you have something that &apos;s not economically sound and try to do that .
For me , this is where most waste happens .
It &apos;s unless you &apos;re very short .
Before a cost breakthrough , and you only fund the learning curve .
I think we should do more things that try to have the potential .
A lot cheaper to be .
If the swab you get is a very high energy price , you know ?
Then you can only keep the rich up .
I mean , each of us here could do five times as much for our energy , I mean .
Without his lifestyle changing , for the lower two billion .
But is it a disaster ?
And even Lomborg thinks about his new mesh , &quot; Why is it that research isn &apos;t going to be discussed anymore ? &quot;
He &apos;s still being discussed because of his earlier stories with the skeptic camp .
But he understood that this is one very lonely group , and he &apos;s been talking about it .
And so he &apos;s now bringing the research argument , and this is a thought I &apos;m thinking is appropriate .
Research , it &apos;s just crazy .
How little does it support ? CA : Bill .
I think I speak for almost everybody , I think .
Here , when I say , &quot; I really hope your desire will come true . &quot;
Thank you very much .
BG : Thank you .
I would like to tell you something .
What I thought I &apos;d like to do a few months ago when I wrote an article for Italian Wired .
Is it me who wrote ?
Is it always my synonymous dictionary that &apos;s ready for use ?
But I was with editing the dictionary .
It &apos;s done .
And I noticed that I was still never able to live in my life .
What the word hinders really means .
I read you the entry : Disabled .
Adjective : Curved .
Helpless , useless , destroyed .
Deceased , mutilated .
Wounded , prepared , paralyzed .
Separated .
Keep it away .
Defeated , weakened .
Impotent .
Castriert .
Paralyzed .

@ improved , done
@ broken
@ borrowed
@ counted ( see also injured )
@ useless
And @ weak
@ Anonyme , healthy
@ strong , powerful
I have this list with a friend read out loud
And I had to laugh first .
It worked so ridiculous .
But I just came up and prepared and couldn &apos;t speak any more .
And I had to stop reading .
And I first collected after this assaulted flood of words .
And with the emotional shock that it causes .
Of course , it was a fractured old synonym dictionary .
I got just thinking that the word output was pretty old , it had to be old .
But actually , it was an issue on the early &apos; 80s .
When I was just in primary school , and I started with that , my self @-@ image outside of my family environment started to build .
And to shape it , also in terms of other kids and the rest of the world around me .
And God thank God , I did not have a synonymous dictionary at the time .
I would take this entry seriously .
Take it , I would have been born into a world that someone like me would perceive as a person whose life is in no way positive .
Can today , however , I become a person for the opportunities and adventures I &apos;ve experienced ?
So I celebrated , so I immediately went online in 2009 , and I started to call myself the 2009 edition .
And I expected that I could have a more appealing contribution here .
Here &apos;s the updated version .
This entry , unfortunately , is not much better .
In particular , the last two words shake me under Near Antonym .
All right and healthy .
But it &apos;s not just about the words .
It &apos;s about what we &apos;re talking about people .
The ones we &apos;re describing with these words , it &apos;s about the values that are in those words .
And how we &apos;re constructing those values .
Our language is influencing our thinking and how we &apos;re shaping the world and people around us , and how we &apos;re seeing the world and the world around us .
Many ancient societies , including Greeks , and Greeks and Romans , really believed that the Greeks and Romans &apos; pronunciation of a curse has a great force , because what you say loudly is manifesting itself can manifest itself .
So what do we want ?
Actually , a disabled person or a powerful person manifests himself .
One person , careless as a child , could be enough .
Restricting them and giving them ideas would be not more beautiful to open doors to them .
A person .
The person for me has opened doors was my pediatrician .
AM A.I. DuPont Institute in Wilmington , Wilmington , Delaware .
His name is Dr. Pizzutillo , an Italo @-@ American whose name , as you can imagine , is called .
Most Americans , not correctly speaking out , so he was always Dr. P. called .
And Dr. P. always wore very colorful flies .
And he was for working with kids .
Simple , made .
I found the time I was in this hospital that I spent .
Simply great , except for my physiotherapy .
I had to do individual exercises , seemingly infinitely .
With these thick elastic bands in different colors .
You know that around .
My leg muscles build up , and I have hated these bands more .
When everything else , I hated them .
I have cursed them .
I have hated them .
And imagine if you can imagine I even have been five years old with Dr. P. P. negotiating with Dr. P.
And so this is how I try to stop these exercises .
Natural , without success .
And one day he has me with a guy doing one of my exercises .
These exercises were just tiring .
And mercilessly , and he said to me , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you &apos;re such a strong guy .
Strong and young girl , you &apos;re going to be one of those tapes one day .
And if you can do it , I &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
That was , of course , just a simple trick by Dr. P. to do the exercises .
I don &apos;t want to do that with the prospect that the richest five @-@ year @-@ old girl in the hospital will be on the second floor .
But he has actually made me do that .
My daily exercise horror with new eyes to see .
So it turned into a new and promising experience .
And I wonder today how much I &apos;m feeling about his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl .
My self @-@ image has shaped and I imagine myself like this , as one of nature , strong , powerful and atlethic people , to see myself .
This is just one example of many of us , adults .
In positions of power , stimulating a child &apos;s imagination , but like the examples that I &apos;ve already mentioned from the synonymous dictionaries , our language doesn &apos;t allow us any space to imagine something .
What we all want would be it for each and every one of us to allow ourselves to be seen as powerful people .
Our language lags behind social change .
The changes that are often caused by technological change have been triggered by medical considerations , from a medical point of view .
Of course , it can be said that my legs , laser surgery for visually impaired visually impaired knee joints , made of titanium and artificial hip joints .
For aging bodies that make it possible for people to really all their possibilities .
And to get beyond the limits that their natural destiny sets them .
Not to mention at all .
Not to mention social networking platforms . People allow themselves to give their own identity , give themselves in their own way .
And thereby define themselves globally to groups , which they are oriented to choose .
Perhaps , then , this technological shift makes this clearer .
Because ever before , it &apos;s always been a different truth , which is that every person in society has something very special and very powerful giving that can happen .
And that human ability to adapt to each other .
Our greatest plus is human ability to adapt to each other .
That &apos;s an interesting story .
Because people always keep asking me to adapt to each other to tell me how to deal with adversity , and I &apos;ll confess something to you .
This sentence has something for me never been fitting .
And I &apos;ve always been very uncomfortable with it , and I &apos;ve always felt the questions of people to answer , and I think I &apos;m beginning to understand .
I understand why .
This sentence about how to deal with adversity lives from the idea that success or happiness comes from it .
A challenge to master without being challenged by the experience that it brings ,
As if my life is so successful , because I have the potential traps of a life with a prosthetic dodge , to avoid .
Or , whatever , people , with my disability , perceive me .
But the truth is that we are changing .
Of course , we are shaped by the challenge .
Whether you &apos;re physically , emotionally or even both , and I claim that this is good , right ?
Mistakes are not an obstacle .
That we need to curve to work with our lives better , to make it clear .
Migrates are just part of our lives .
And I tend to treat adversity as my shadow .
Sometimes I realize it &apos;s very present .
Sometimes it &apos;s hardly visible .
But it &apos;s constantly with me .
And I want to make absolutely no sense of the impact or severity of a human being &apos;s struggle .
There are in life adversity and challenges .
And they &apos;re all too real .
And every person goes different .
But to ask the question is not whether we can make it clear with adversity or not .
But how do we make it clear , so we &apos;re not just responsible for that .
People who we love before blows of fate save us from blows of fate , but also prepare them for it .
Good .
So , to make it clear .
And we do our kids no favours .
If we give them the feeling that they feel they don &apos;t adapt .
You have to make two things clear .
One is the medical fact that amputees are being amputated and the other is .
The social opinion about whether I &apos;m disabled or not .
And to be honest , the only real and lasting disability is with the one I have to deal with , and to be honest , the only real disability that I have had to deal with is that the world is constantly saying .
It can connect me with these definitions .
In our desire to make people protected , the people that care about us .
And to give them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis .
Or even a prognosis about quality of life .
Imagine the one that expects them to do , we need to be careful not to lay the foundation for somebody actually being disabled .
Maybe that &apos;s the current concept .
That &apos;s just looking at what &apos;s broken in a broken .
And how we fix that for everybody , a bigger disability for each one than pathology , in itself .
If we want to avoid treating a human being holistically and not all of his forces .
And perceive possibilities .
And recognize , we create , in addition to the natural struggle that you may need to fight .
Another disease .
We degrade a human being who is responsible for our society , and we do so .
So we have to talk beyond patology .
Look and look at all areas of human potential , and focus on this .
Most importantly ,
But is it that there is a difference between percepting our shortcomings and our great inventive spirit , and that is , we have a relationship between the perception of our inadequacies and our great inventive spirit ?
We should be able to devalue these challenging times or deny them .
We should not try to avoid them .
We should not try to rug them under the carpet , but we should be trying to create opportunities in adversity .
It &apos;s perhaps more about making it clear to me that we are not necessarily going to have to overcome adversity , but that we are open to it .
You embrace it .
You embrace it .
And maybe even to dance with it .
And maybe we can do things like adversity as something natural , coherent .
And useful to see .
And feel like this through their presence , no longer .
So burdened in this year , we celebrate the 200th anniversary of Charles .
Darwin and when he was 150 years ago about evolution , he wrote about evolution , Darwin , in my eyes , has something very true in human character .
I would say it that way , not the strongest of its kind survives .
And neither does Darwin , the smartest of its kind , but the one who best adapts to change .
Conflicts are creating creativity , not just from Darwin &apos;s work .
Do we know that the human capacity to survive and flourish is dependent on the struggle of the human mind ?
It &apos;s determined by conflict to change .
So again , change .
And adaptation is the greatest ability of man .
And maybe we know only from which wood .
We &apos;re carved when we &apos;re really tested .
Maybe that &apos;s exactly the meaning of adversity .
A perception of ego .
A sense of our own power .
We can feel ourselves something like this .
We can give adversity a new meaning that &apos;s about difficult times beyond difficult times .
Maybe we can treat adversity as change .
Adversity stands for change .
We are still not adapted to it .
I think the greatest damage we have done to ourselves is the greatest damage we believe we have normal to be normal .
Let &apos;s face it .
Who is normal ?
There is no normal .
There is the usual .
The typical , but not .
The normal .
And would you like to have this poor , gray person really ?
Do you want to learn if there were really ?
I think not .
It would be great .
If we could have this pattern of normality versus another of the possibilities or the strength around it , even another one , a little more dangerous .
Could exchange .
So we can exchange the forces of very many children .
And they can invite them to release their very special and valuable abilities into society .
Anthropolgen has found that we humans are being driven by the members of our society to always demand one thing : To be useful .
And to contribute to that .
There are indications that there are already Neanderthals who , 60,000 years ago , older people and people with severe physical problems , with worn injuries , have .
And that may have happened because life experience in the survival struggle of these people is valuable to society .
They have these people not broken as broken .
And they have been useless . They have been seen as something special .
And valuable , treated a few years ago , I went to the city , where I grew up .
I went to a food market , in that Red Zone , in the northeast of Pennsylvania , and I stood in front of a cup of tomatoes .
It was summer .
And I had shorts on , and I hear a guy listening behind me say , &quot;
&quot; Well , if that &apos;s not Aimee Mullins , and I turn around and see this older man . &quot;
I had no idea .
Who he is ?
And I said , &quot; Excuse me . &quot;
Sir , do we know ?
I can &apos;t get to remember you and he said , &quot; Well , you should be hard to remember .
Remember me when I turned you to the first time , I saw you from my belly of her mother .
Oh , so , he , and of course it &apos;s got . &quot;
But click .
That was Dr.
Kean , a man I just made of stories from my mother about this day .
Because of course I &apos;m typical of my birthday , two weeks late , two weeks late , the doctor for prenatal diagnostics .
My mother was on vacation , and so my parents knew the man , the man , who gave me birth .
Not at all .
And because I was born without a calf &apos;s legs .
And my feet , after them , had directed themselves , and I just had a few toes on this one and a few toes .
On the other foot , it was the carrier of this stranger , who had to bring the bad news .
He said to me , &quot; I had to tell your parents that you would never walk .
And never be so mobile as you would be like other kids , or you would never be able to live an independent life . &quot;
And since then , they &apos;ve just been lying to me .
Really punished .
Exceptional , I found that he had newspaper clips collected from all of my childhood .
Whether I was in a letter contest in the second grade , whether I had won .
Whether I was with the scout scouts at the Halloween Parade on Halloween , whether I was traveling my scholarship or a scholarship or one of my sporting victories .
And he used these clips to make his students teach .
Medical students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School , and he called this part of his course &quot; The X Factor . &quot;
The potential of human will : You can &apos;t just emphasize enough how crucial this factor is to the quality of life of a human being .
And Dr. Kean continued , he said , &quot; I learned that children , if they don &apos;t always do something else , get to be said .
And even if they &apos;re just a little bit supported , if you kids themselves are left to their own devices , children can achieve a lot .
Look .
Dr. Kean has his .
Thinking changes . He had understood that the medical diagnosis and how someone could deal with it .
Two different things are :
And I too have my thinking in the course of time changed .
If you want to change me at the age of 15 , would you have asked me if I could have my prostheses exchanged for legs made of meat and bones ?
Would that have meant that I would not have hesitated for a second ?
I wanted to be absolutely normal at that time .
If you would have asked me that today , I am not so sure .
And that &apos;s what happened .
Because I have something to do with my legs .
And not despite these experiences .
And maybe this change could happen as well , because I &apos;ve been meeting so many people .
They have opened doors to me instead of meeting people who meet me , limit me , or overtake an idea .
Look at it . It really only takes one person .
It &apos;s demonstrating to you how you manifest your forces .
And you &apos;re through when you do it to somebody .
His own inner forces to activate .
The human mind is so receptive .
If you do that and for someone in a critical moment , a door opens .
Then you &apos;re for these people .
A very good teacher .
You bring them with you doors to themselves to open .
The real meaning of the word Educate is rooted in the word Educe .
It means creating something that in a word is the potential to tickle out , again , what potential do you want ?
Because we &apos;re going to call you up now , in the &apos; 60s , a case study was done in the United Kingdom .
Back then , high schools were transformed into schools .
They call this streaming trials .
In the United States , we call this tracking , and students are going to be .
After grades , and the A students are going to be orally harder to get tested .
The better teachers , etc . , they have a three @-@ month period of time , students with a sufficiently high grade , very well given .
It was told them .
They were Aces that they were very smart .
And after these three months , they really have written Einster .
And of course , it breaks your heart to hear that the other way around , the Einster students were told .
They &apos;re just enough , and the same was the case .
Then , after the three months , too .
But only those who still have to live in school , apart from the students who were the school school school @-@ makers .
And it &apos;s very important to do this study that teachers were not inaugurated .
Teachers knew not that something changed .
They were just told that they were the one @-@ serer students , and that they were the students with the grade enough , and they were taught something like that .
And she treats the only real disability is a broken mind .
A spirit that was broken has no hope anymore .
He doesn &apos;t find anything beautiful anymore .
He lacks our natural , childish .
Curiosity .
And our innate ability to imagination , if we do , but we can create the human mind to help with it .
And then hoping to self and others , to look around himself , beautiful to find themselves .
Curiously and imaginatively , then sit down and put our forces really positively .
One : If a mind is talking about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new forms of existence .
I want to start with a poem .
This is from a Persian poet called Hafiz in the 14th century , written .
And from which my friend Jacques , Dembois , told me , and the poem is called &quot; The God Who Only Words Four . &quot;
Every child knows God , not the God .
The name , not the God of prohibitions , but the God .
He who only knows four words , and repeats them all the time .
He always says , &quot; Come dance with me . &quot;
&quot; Come dance with me . &quot;
Thank you very much .
