A few years ago here at TED , Peter Skillman presented a design competition called &quot; The Marshmallow Challenge . &quot;
The idea is pretty simple .
Four teams have to have the widest possible freestanding structure with 20 spaghetti .
CA : 1m tape .
CA : 1m thread and build a marshmallow , the marshmallow has to be up on top .
And though it really seems easy , it &apos;s actually really hard .
Because it &apos;s pushing people to work together very quickly .
And so I thought this is an interesting idea .
And I turned it into a design workshop .
It was a huge success .
Since then , I &apos;ve been doing about 70 workshops around the world with students , developers and architects , even CTOs , the Fortune 50 companies .
And there &apos;s something about this task .
What enables deep impressions of the nature of collaboration .
And I want to share some of these with you .
Normally , most people start orienting themselves on the task .
They talk about it .
They think about what it will look like .
They &apos;re rangling for power .
Then they &apos;re spending a little time planning and organization .
They &apos;re sketching and putting spaghetti out .
They &apos;re investing a lot of their time in assembling .
Constantly growing structures .
And finally , just before they don &apos;t have time anymore , someone takes the Marshmallow .
And they put it gently on the top .
Step back and TA @-@ DA . Admire your work .
But what happens then almost always is that TA @-@ DA becomes an UH @-@ Oh , because the weight of the marshmallow causes the whole thing to bend and collapse .
There are a number of people who have much more UH @-@ Oh moments than others .
And among the worst are freshest BWL graduates .
They lie , they cheat .
They &apos;re confused and they really produce poor shapes .
And of course there are teams that have much more TA @-@ DA formations .
And among the best are freshness graduates of the kindergarten .
And that &apos;s quite amazing .
As Peter told us , they not only produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
What you might ask is , how does this come about ?
Why ?
What about those ?
And Peter doesn &apos;t tell any of the kids , &quot; Is time investing ? &quot;
To be the head of Spaghetti GmbH .
They don &apos;t invest time in power struggles .
But there &apos;s another reason .
And that is that BWL students were trained to find a real plan .
OK .
And then to realize what happens .
If you put the marshmallow on top , you don &apos;t have time anymore .
And what happens ?
It &apos;s a crisis .
Sounds familiar .
What kids do differently is they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes .
Successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so they have multiple possibilities to repair dilapidated prototypes .
Constructors recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of an iterative process .
And with every attempt , the kids get immediate feedback .
What works ?
And what doesn &apos;t work ?
So the performance is to work with prototypes .
But let &apos;s see how different teams operate .
The average for most is about 50 centimeters , BWL students create .
Half of them lawyers do a little bit more .
But not much kindergarten kids are better than adults .
Who &apos;s the most successful architect and engineer ?
Fortunately .
1M is the highest .
What I &apos;ve seen and why ?
Because they understand triangles and are self @-@ reinforcing geometric patterns .
The key to building stable structures is that CEOs are slightly above average .
But here it gets interesting .
You put an executive administrator in there .
On the team , they get significantly better .
It &apos;s incredible .
You look around and you see this team will win .
You can predict that .
Why is that ?
Because you have special skills in process monitoring .
You run the process .
You understand it and that team .
That governs and works .
Attention will significantly improve the performance of the team .
Specialized skills and process skills and their combination will lead to success .
If you have 10 teams that are typical , you get .
CA : 6 .
The stable structures have â€” I tried something exciting .
I thought , let &apos;s get the poker bet right away .
So I offered a $ 10,000 prize for the winners .
What do you think ?
Did this design student happen ?
What was that ?
Result : This was not what happened . A team had a stable structure .
If anyone had built a two @-@ inch construction , they would have borne the prize home .
So isn &apos;t it interesting that high betting has a strong effect ?
We repeated this exercise with the same students .
What do you think happened ?
Well , you understood the advantage of prototyping .
So , from the same bad team , one of the best ones .
They made the highest construction in the least time .
So there are profound lessons for us about the nature of propulsion and success .
You might ask , why would someone actually invest time ?
Creating a Marshmallow Challenge .
The reason is , I help .
Create digital tools and processes to help teams .
Create cars , video games and visual effects .
And what the Marshmallow Challenge does is it helps you identify hidden assumptions , because frankly , every project has its own Marshmallow .
The challenge is to have a shared experience , a common language , or a common attitude , to build the right prototype .
And this is the value of this experience .
This simple exercise , and those of you who are interested in it , can be MarshmallowChallenge .
COM : Visit .
It &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the Marshmallows .
There &apos;s a step @-@ by @-@ step guide there .
You can find crazy examples from around the world , like people optimize and refining the system .
There are also world records .
And the basal lesson , I think , is the construction , actually , a connecting one .
Sport is what it requires that we all focus our senses on the task and that we use our thinking optimally , like our emotions and our actions , in the challenge that lies ahead of us .
And sometimes a small prototype .
This experience , everything it takes .
Bring us from an UH @-@ Oh to a TA @-@ DA moment .
And that can make a big difference .
Thank you very much .
Let &apos;s pretend we have a machine here .
A big machine .
A cool TED @-@ like machine .
And that &apos;s a time machine .
And everybody in this room has to be in .
And you can go into the past .
You can go into the future .
You can &apos;t go into this one .
And now stay .
And I wonder what you would choose , because I &apos;ve been asking my friends a lot lately .
And they all wanted to go into the past .
I don &apos;t know .
They wanted to go back to time before cars existed .
Or Twitter or America is looking for the superstar .
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re kind of drawn to nostalgia , wishful thinking .
And I understand that .
I &apos;m not part of this group , I have to say .
I don &apos;t want to go back to the past .
And that &apos;s not because I &apos;m an adventurer .
It &apos;s because opportunities on this planet don &apos;t go back .
They go forward .
So I want to go into this machine .
And I want to go into the future .
This is the greatest time that there has ever been on this planet .
No matter what scale you &apos;re applying .
Health , wealth .
Mobility .
Opportunities .
Declining disease rates .
There has never been a time like this before .
My great grandparents all died when they were 60 .
My grandparents pushed this number to 70 .
My parents are 80 on the heels .
So there should be a nine at the beginning of my death .
But it &apos;s not even about people like us .
Because this is a bigger thing .
As a child born today in New Delhi can expect .
To live as long as the richest man in the world .
100 years ago , think about it .
This is an incredible fact .
And why is this ?
Skirts , smallpox , have killed billions of people on this planet .
They &apos;ve redesigned Earth &apos;s demographics in a way .
How it &apos;s not war ?
They &apos;ve ever managed . They &apos;re gone .
They &apos;ve disappeared .
We &apos;ve defeated them .
Puff : In the rich world , there are diseases that have threatened millions of us just a generation ago .
Hardly any diphtheria is rubbing , polio knows anything .
Somebody else , what is that ? Vaccines .
Modern medicine .
Our ability to feed billions of people .
These are successes of the scientific method , and in my view , it &apos;s :
The scientific method of trying things out , look if it works .
It changes .
If it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
So that &apos;s the good news .
Unfortunately , that &apos;s the good news .
Because there are some other problems .
And they &apos;ve been mentioned many times , and one .
Of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people in the world go hungry to bed every day .
This number is rising , and it &apos;s rising very quickly .
And that &apos;s embarrassing .
And not just that .
We have our imagination .
We &apos;ve used this to thoroughly devastate this world : Drinking water , primal land .
Rainforests , oil , gas .
They disappear .
And they disappear soon .
And if we don &apos;t innovate out of this chaos , we disappear . The question is ,
So can we do that ?
I think so .
I think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food .
The billions of people will feed without rape the land they live in .
I think we can provide this world with energy that doesn &apos;t destroy it at the same time .
I really think so .
And no .
This is not wishful thinking .
But this keeps me awake at night .
One of the things that keeps me awake at night .
We &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as much as we &apos;ve never done before .
And we &apos;ve never been able to make it sensible .
As we can do today .
We &apos;re on the threshold of amazing , amazing events in many areas .
And yet I really think we need to go back hundreds of 300 years before the Enlightenment to find a time .
In which we &apos;ve been fighting progress where we &apos;ve been more violent about these things .
More fronts than we have now .
People are wrapping themselves in their faith , so tight that you can &apos;t liberate them .
Not even .
The truth will liberate them and hear them .
Everyone has a right to their opinion .
Even a right to their opinion on progress .
But do you know what they don &apos;t have a right to ?
Do you not have a right to their own facts ? Blame .
Do you not ?
And I took a while to figure out . About a decade ago , I wrote an article about vaccines for The New Yorker , a little article .
And I was amazed to encounter resistance , resistance to what was , in the end , the most effective measure .
In health care , in the history of humanity , is .
I didn &apos;t know what to do .
So I just did what I always do .
I wrote an article and I went on .
And soon afterwards , I wrote an article about genetically modified .
Food : The same thing , just bigger .
People were crazy .
So I also wrote an article about it .
And I couldn &apos;t understand why people thought .
That would be franc food .
Why ?
They thought molecules were moving around in a certain way , rather than a random way , an attack on nature .
But you know , I &apos;m doing what I &apos;m doing .
I wrote the article .
I went on .
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist .
We type .
We &apos;re handing in .
We go eating .
That &apos;s okay .
But these articles worried me .
And I couldn &apos;t figure out .
Why ?
And finally , I found out .
And that &apos;s because these fanatics who made me crazy were not fanatics at all .
These were prudent people , educated people , decent people .
People , they were just like the people in this room .
And that got me so confused .
But then I thought , &quot; You know what ?
Let &apos;s be honest .
We &apos;ve got to a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress .
As in the past .
We talk about it in two ways .
We talk about it ironically , with small quotes .
That &apos;s why progress .
Okay .
There are reasons for that .
And I think we know what reasons that are .
We have trust in institutions , in authority .
And sometimes we have lost faith in science itself .
And there &apos;s no reason why that shouldn &apos;t be like that .
You can just name a few names .
And people will understand Chernobyl , Bhopal , Challenger , Vioxx , weapons of mass destruction .
The 2000 US presidential election .
I mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
There are questions and problems with the people we thought were always right .
So be skeptical .
Ask questions , ask evidence , demand evidence .
You provide evidence .
Take nothing but given .
But now , if you get evidence , you have to accept that evidence .
And that &apos;s not good for us .
And I can say that for the reason that we are now living in an epidemic of fear .
As I &apos;ve never seen before .
And hopefully never again will see about 12 years ago .
A story was published .
A terrible story that linked the autism epidemic to measles , mumps and rubells , vaccines .
Very scary .
Happily studies were done to see if that was true , Haufenwise .
Studies were to be conducted .
That &apos;s a serious matter .
The data came in .
The data came in from the United States .
England , Sweden , Canada .
And they were all the same , no correlation .
No connection , no connection at all .
It makes no difference .
It makes no difference .
Because we believe in anecdotes .
We believe in what we see , what we believe to see .
What causes us to feel real ?
We don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents from a government agency that gives us data .
And I understand that .
I think we all do that .
But you know what ?
The result of that was catastrophic , catastrophic .
Because of that fact , the United States is one of the only countries in the world .
In which the vaccine rate for measles is falling .
That &apos;s scandalous .
And we should be ashamed .
It &apos;s terrible .
What happened is that we could do that ?
Well , I understand that .
I do .
Because if you have measles here , you have one in the audience .
The way someone sees measles die doesn &apos;t happen very often .
In this country , not at all .
But 160,000 times in the world .
Last year , these are many measles deaths , 20 per hour .
But because this hasn &apos;t happened here .
Can we displace it ?
And people like Jenny McCarthy can walk around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like Oprah and Larry King live .
And they can do that because they don &apos;t connect cause and correlation .
They don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same .
But almost never are the same .
And that &apos;s something we need to learn .
And it &apos;s very fast .
This guy was a hero .
Jonas Salk : He liberated us from one of the worst scourges of humanity .
Don &apos;t worry , no pain , polio .
Puff disappeared .
The guy in the middle .
Not so much .
He &apos;s called .
Paul Offit : He &apos;s just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a few other people .
He can save the lives of 400 , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
Very good .
Not . Well .
That &apos;s good .
Apart from Paul walking around talking about vaccines and saying , &quot; How valuable ? &quot;
They are , and people should just stop .
And that &apos;s what he says , actually .
So Paul is a terrorist .
When Paul speaks at a public hearing , he cannot say without armed guards .
He gets calls at home because people like to tell him they know where his kids are going to school .
And why ?
Because Paul made a vaccine .
I don &apos;t need to say that .
But vaccines are essential .
Take them away .
Returning to the diseases , terrible diseases .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s happening right now .
We have measles in this country now .
And that &apos;s getting worse .
And pretty soon , kids will die of it again .
Because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
And they &apos;re not just going to die of measles .
What about polio ?
Let &apos;s take that .
Why not ?
A fellow militant of mine wrote to me a few weeks ago saying , &quot; She believes .
I &apos;m a little too shrill .
Nobody has that . &quot;
Ever before , she said she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against polio .
Absolutely not fine .
Why ?
Because we don &apos;t have polio .
And you know what ?
We didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
Today , I don &apos;t know .
Maybe this morning rose .
Someone in Lagos , in an airplane , is flying to Los Angeles .
Right now , he &apos;s over Ohio .
And in a few hours , he lands .
And he rents a car .
And he comes to Long Beach .
And he &apos;s going to be one of these fantastic TED dinner .
And he &apos;s going to visit tonight , and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a paralyzing disease .
And we don &apos;t know .
Because that &apos;s how the world works .
Well , this is the planet we live on .
Don &apos;t pretend that it &apos;s not .
We love to lie in lies .
We love that .
Did you all take your vitamins this morning ? Echinacea .
A little antioxidant that helps you jump .
I know you did that because half of Americans do that every day .
You take that stuff .
And you take alternative remedies .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find that they &apos;re useless .
The data records that all the time .
They evaporate their urine more .
Never do it .
That &apos;s okay .
You like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
I totally agree with you : Dark urine , dark .
Why do we do that ?
Why do we do that ?
Well , I think I understand we hate the pharmaceutical industry .
We hate too strong a government .
We don &apos;t have confidence in the system .
And we shouldn &apos;t . Our healthcare system is bad .
It &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
It &apos;s absolutely amazing , cold and soul @-@ exhilarating , even to us who can afford it .
So we &apos;re walking away from it .
And where are we going ?
We &apos;re walking into the arms of the placebo industry .
That &apos;s great .
I love the placebo industry .
But you know , that &apos;s really a serious matter .
Because the stuff is crap .
And we spend billions of dollars on it .
And I have all sorts of little props here , none of them : Gingko fraud , Echinacea fraud , Acai , I don &apos;t even know what .
That &apos;s , but we spend billions of dollars on it .
It &apos;s cheating .
And you know what ?
When I say that , people scream at me and say , &quot; What cares you ? &quot;
&quot; Let people do what they want . &quot;
That &apos;s how they feel .
And you know what ?
They &apos;re wrong because I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the Health Minister .
He says , &quot; Hmm . &quot;
I &apos;m going to get the evidence from my experts on mammography .
Not assume .
Or some cancer quack salver who wants to treat his patients with coffee intakes .
If you go down that path where faith and magic replace evidence and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
You get to Thabo Mbeki in South Africa .
He killed 400,000 of his people because he insisted that red beds , garlic and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs .
We know they can slow down the course of AIDS .
Hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country that is worse than any other one that is plagued by this disease .
Please don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
They have them . They always have them .
Now , the most irrational epidemic we &apos;re in is this absurd battle between the advocates of genetically modified food and the bio @-@ elite .
This is an idiotic debate .
It has to stop .
It &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
This is ideology .
Not science .
Everything we eat .
Every grain of rice , every branch of parsley .
Every sprouts have been changed by people .
You know , there were no mandarin in paradise .
There were no cantaloupe melons .
There were no Christmas trees .
We did all of that .
We did it in the last 11,000 years .
And some of it worked .
And some of it didn &apos;t .
We got rid of it .
What didn &apos;t work .
Now we can make it more accurate .
And of course , there are risks .
But we can do something like vitamin A in rice .
And the stuff can help millions of people .
Millions of people prolong their lives .
They don &apos;t want to do that .
I have to say , I don &apos;t understand .
We reject genetically modified .
Food .
Why do we do that ?
Well , what I hear all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones .
Mono @-@ culture .
We don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing .
That &apos;s wrong .
We don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
We don &apos;t want companies to own seeds .
And you know what ?
My answer to all of that is yes .
You &apos;re right .
Let &apos;s fix that .
It &apos;s true .
We have a huge food problem .
But that &apos;s not science .
That &apos;s not science .
It &apos;s right .
Moral patent crab .
You know science is not a company .
It &apos;s not a country .
It &apos;s not even an idea .
It &apos;s a process .
It &apos;s a process .
And sometimes it works .
And sometimes it doesn &apos;t .
But the idea that we should not allow science to do its work .
Because we &apos;re afraid , it &apos;s a real impasse .
And it keeps millions of people from flourishing .
You know , over the next 50 years , we will have to grow 70 percent more food than we do at the moment .
70 percent .
This investment in Africa over the last 30 years , embarrassing , shameful .
You need that .
And we &apos;re not giving it to you .
And why ?
Genetically modified food .
We don &apos;t want to encourage people .
To eat this rotten stuff , like Maniok Maniok is .
Something that half a billion people eat .
It &apos;s like a potato .
It &apos;s just a bunch of calories .
It &apos;s bad .
It doesn &apos;t have nutrients .
It doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists build it .
All of this is inside of it .
And then people could eat it and not become blind .
They wouldn &apos;t starve .
And you know what ?
That would be nice .
It wouldn &apos;t be Chez Panisse .
But it would be nice , and all I can say is , why do we fight this ?
I mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves .
Why do we fight this ?
Because we don &apos;t want to push genes around .
It &apos;s not about pushing genes around .
It &apos;s not about chemicals .
It &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones .
Our insistence on greater food , better food , unique food .
It &apos;s not about Rice Krispies .
It &apos;s about keeping people alive .
And it &apos;s high time to understand what that means .
Because you know what ?
If we don &apos;t do that , if we keep going as we do .
Let &apos;s be guilty of something we don &apos;t want to be guilty of , I think .
High @-@ tech colonialism .
There &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here .
It &apos;s selfish .
It &apos;s ugly .
It &apos;s not worthy of us .
And we really have to stop that .
So after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; Do you still want to be in this ridiculous time machine ? &quot;
And go to the future anyway .
I definitely want that .
Right now , it &apos;s in the present .
But we have an incredible opportunity .
We can put this time machine on everything we want .
We can move it where we want to move it .
And we will move it to where we want it to be .
We need to have these conversations .
And we need to think .
But when we go into the time machine and go into the future , we will be happy .
We will be happy to have done that .
I know we can .
And as far as I am concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs now .
Thank you .
Thank you .
When Steve Lopez , columnist of the Los Angeles Times ,
One day , walking through the streets in the center of Los Angeles , he heard wonderful music .
She came from a man , an African @-@ American , sympathetic , rough , homeless , playing on a violin that had only two strings left .
Many of you will know the story , because from Steve &apos;s articles about it , later on , a book was filmed .
With Robert Downey Junior , when Steve Lopez and Jamie Foxx , as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers , the contrabass player who studied at the Juilliard Conservatory , and his promising career .
Tragically early on , his paranoid schizophrenia ended .
Nathaniel left Juilliard , suffered a nervous breakdown , and 30 years later , he lived as homeless on the streets of Skid Row .
In the center of Los Angeles
I recommend you read all Steves &apos; book or watch the movie so that you not only understand the wonderful connectedness that has emerged between these two men , but also how the music creates that connection .
And how it eventually was the instrument , when this play of words is allowed , that helped .
Nathaniel : Get off the road .
I met Mr. Ayers .
In 2008 , two years ago , at Walt Disney Concert Hall .
He had just heard a demonstration of Beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and he came behind the stage to imagine myself .
He talked about yo @-@ yo in a very cheerful and savory tone .
MA : And Hillary Clinton : And about how the Dodgers would never make it into the Baseball World Series .
And all of this because of the insidious passage .
The first violin in the last sentence of Beethoven &apos;s Fourth Symphony .
We came up with the theme of &quot; Music to Speak , &quot; and a few days later , I got an email saying that Nathaniel was interested in violin lessons with me .
I have to mention that Nathaniel refused medical treatment , because he had already been treated with electroshocks and with thorazin and handcuffs .
A trauma that has persecuted him all his life as a result of that is now particularly vulnerable .
For these schizophrenic phases .
They &apos;re sometimes so bad that they &apos;re threatening to tear him apart .
And he &apos;s disappearing for days .
In the streets of Skid Row , he &apos;s always wandering around in this horror and facing the torture torments of his own mind .
And in exactly the same stage of excitement , Nathaniel was when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall .
He had this crazy flicker in his eyes and he was totally lost .
He talked about invisible demons and smoke and about how someone wanted to poison him in his sleep .
I was afraid , not for me , but I was afraid I could lose him , that he could sink into one of his states , and that I could destroy his relationship with the violin .
When I started talking about clay ladders and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin education .
So I just started playing .
I played the first movement of Beethoven &apos;s violin concerto .
And as I played , I noticed that in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes , there was a complete change .
It was as if he was under the influence of an invisible doctor .
A chemical reaction , the catalyst of which was my game , Nathaniel &apos;s maniac anger , turned into understanding , into a calm curiosity and grace .
And as if by a miracle , he took his violin and began to listen .
Some excerpts of violin concerts , and then asked me to finish playing them .
Mendelssohn Chaikovsky , Sibelius .
And we started talking about music .
From Bach to Beethoven , Brahms , Bruckner and all the other BS from BartÃ³k to Esa @-@ Pekka Salonen .
And I realized that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but he also had it .
He also had a close personal relationship .
He talked about her with a passion and an understanding that I usually only know of my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic , playing music and talking about music , was confused by this paranoid .
Man who had just moved through the streets of Los Angeles .
He had become a kind , educated , excellent musician in Juilliard .
Music is medicine .
Music changes us . For Nathaniel , music means mental health .
Because music allows him to transform his thoughts and delusions into something real with the help of imagination and creativity .
And so he escapes his tormenting state .
I understood that this is the essence of art .
Exactly .
This is why we make music so that we can do something deep inside of us all .
Shape our emotions through our artistic lens , through our creativity into reality .
And the reality of that expression reaches us all , and moves , inspires and unites us .
What Nathaniel did was bring him back to a community of friends .
The redeeming power of music brought him back to a family of musicians who understood him .
They recognized his talent and respected him , and I will play with Nathaniel again and again .
Whether at Walt Disney Concert Hall or at Skid Row , because he reminds me why I became a musician .
Thank you very much .
Bruno Giussani : Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Robert Gupta : Robert Gupta : I want to play something that I shamefully stolen from the cellist .
I hope you will forgive me .
I &apos;m Jane McGonigal .
I design computer games .
I &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years now .
And my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy .
Save the world in reality as it is to save in online games .
I have a plan for that .
I want to convince more people , including all of you , to spend more time playing bigger and more amazing games .
We &apos;re currently spending three billion hours a week playing online .
Some of you may think , well , that &apos;s a lot of time for games .
Maybe a little too much time .
If you think about how many problems we have to solve urgently in the real world .
But in fact , according to my research at the Institute for the Future , that &apos;s exactly the opposite .
Right ? Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the world &apos;s most pressing problems .
In fact , I &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to dramatically increase that time .
I &apos;ve calculated that the time needed is 21 billion hours of playing time .
That &apos;s per week .
That seems a little bit absurd first , maybe .
So I &apos;ll repeat it with that .
It can work if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , I think we need to try .
Play online for at least 21 billion hours per week until the end of the next decade .
No .
I mean , it &apos;s really serious .
Why ?
This picture is pretty accurate .
Why ?
I think games are so vital to the survival of the human species in the future .
Serious .
This is a portrait of photographer Phil Toledano .
He wanted to capture the feelings of playing .
So he built a camera in front of the players .
This is one of the classic expressions .
When playing when you &apos;re not a player , you may miss some of the nuances .
In this picture , you probably see this sense of urgency .
A little scared .
But also extreme concentration , deeply deepened .
Solving a really difficult problem .
If you play , you &apos;ll see some nuances here , the eyes pulled upwards .
And the mouth is a sign of optimism .
The eyebrows show surprise .
This is a player on the edge of what &apos;s called an epic .
Victory : Oh , you know that ?
OK .
Great .
So we have some players here , an epic .
Victory is a result that &apos;s so extraordinarily positive that they didn &apos;t even know before that it was possible at all .
It was almost beyond imagination .
And if you get there , you &apos;re shocked that you &apos;re actually capable of doing this .
This is an epical victory . These players are about to win an epic victory .
And this is what we have to see on millions of faces of problem solvers around the world .
If we tackle the hurdles of the next century , the face of those who are on the verge of an epic victory , contrary to all odds .
Well , unfortunately , we see this face in real life .
If we face difficult problems , I call it that in life , I &apos;m bad face .
And it &apos;s actually my face .
Look , yeah .
OK .
That &apos;s me .
How I am in life , I &apos;m bad face .
Do this is a graffiti in my former home country in Berkeley , California , where I studied in my PhD thesis .
Why we &apos;re better at playing than we are in real life ?
That &apos;s a problem .
That &apos;s a problem that many players have . We think in reality we &apos;re not as good as playing .
And I mean , not only less successful .
Although that &apos;s part of it , we &apos;re getting more in play worlds .
I mean , good at motivating us to do something meaningful .
Inspired at working with each other .
If we &apos;re in a game world , I think many of us are turning into our best version , always and immediately ready to help solve the problem , persistent .
Try trying as long as necessary to try it again after the failure .
And in reality , if we fail , if we encounter obstacles , we often feel different .
We feel overwhelmed .
We feel ourselves .
We feel overwhelmed , we feel threatened .
Maybe depressed .
Frustrated , right ?
Cynical ?
We never have those feelings .
When we play games in games , they just don &apos;t exist .
And that &apos;s what I wanted to study as a PhD student .
Why is it in games ?
It &apos;s impossible to think .
You couldn &apos;t just achieve everything .
How can we transfer those feelings from games to reality ?
So I looked at games like World of Warcraft , which is the ideal environment for solving problems together .
And I noticed a few things .
The epic victories in online worlds .
So make it possible first , when you start playing one of these online games , especially at World of Warcraft , there are a lot of different characters willing to entrust them with a world saving mission .
And that immediately .
But not just any mission , but a mission .
It fits perfectly with your current level in the game .
Right ?
So you can do that .
You never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
But always on the edge of your skills , so you have to make an effort .
But there &apos;s no unemployment .
In World of Warcraft , you don &apos;t sit around and you turn around demons .
There &apos;s always something very important to do .
And there are , in a way , employees wherever they go .
Hundreds of thousands of people working with them to do their epic mission .
So , to conclude .
We have that in real life .
Not so easy .
This feeling that , when you have a fingercut , you have employees who are willing to do it in a way .
And there &apos;s this epic story .
This inspiring story , why we &apos;re there .
And what we have to do is we get all this positive feedback .
You &apos;ve certainly heard about level up and level 1 , strength , or intelligence .
This constant feedback is not in real life .
When I leave this stage , I don &apos;t have one speech and one crazy idea .
20 .
Crazy idea .
I get real life .
This feedback , not .
So the problem with the online collaboration worlds like World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying .
Being on the brink of an epic victory at any time , that we prefer to spend all our time in these games .
They &apos;re just better than reality .
So far , all World of Warcraft players have spent together 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth .
That &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
It may sound bad .
But to see it in context , 5.93 million years ago , it started .
Our first primate ancestors were going to walk upright .
The first upright primacy .
So OK .
So when we talk about how much time we spend playing at the moment , that just makes sense .
When you look at the time to see the scale of human development .
What &apos;s extraordinary , but also appropriate .
Because it turns out that by using it all the time at play , we actually change that .
What we as humans are able to do .
We develop into a community .
Thinking , heartfelt beings .
That &apos;s the truth .
That &apos;s what I believe .
Look at it .
This interesting statistic , which was recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University .
The average young person today spends in a country with a strong playing culture .
10,000 hours playing online until the age of 21 .
So 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
First of all , for kids in the United States , 10,080 hours is the exact total time they spend in school , from fifth grade to the end of high school .
So if you never miss it , we have a complete parallel education path here , where young people are .
And so we learn what it means .
Being a good player , like anything else you learn in school .
And maybe some of you have the new book by Malcolm Gladwell .
Overflying .
So you know his theory of success .
The theory of success of 10,000 hours .
It &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science that if we spend 10,000 hours studying any subject hard until the age of 21 , we will master it .
In it , we will be so good at it .
Whatever to do , like the most important people in the world .
So what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are master players , so the big question is , what exactly are players ?
Masterfully good .
Because if we could figure out that out , we would have virtually never before had any human potential at our disposal .
So many people in the world today , we have at least an hour a day playing online .
These are our master players , 500 million people .
These are extraordinary .
Good .
There are some .
And over the next decade , we have another billion players who are exceptionally good at whatever .
If you haven &apos;t heard it yet , the game industry is developing consoles that save energy .
And on mobile networks , instead of broadband Internet , they &apos;re working .
So players around the world , especially in India .
China , Brazil , playing online , you can expect .
An additional billion players in the next decade .
So we have a total of 1.5 billion players .
So I started thinking about what it is .
What these games are doing to us .
Here are the four things I found .
First , urgency optimism .
OK .
Imagine how extreme self @-@ motivation .
Urgent optimism is desire to do something right away .
Mastering a hurdle , along with believing that we have a reasonable hope of success .
Players always believe that an epical victory is possible and that it &apos;s always worth trying .
And that &apos;s the same : Players don &apos;t sit around .
Players are champions in spiders .
Poet social networks .
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research .
They show that we like people more .
After we played with them , even if they beat us badly .
The reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
We trust that someone spends time with us , that the rules are being respected , that we have the same goal .
And up to the end of the game .
So that allows for playing together .
The growth of ties , trust and cooperation .
As a result , we build stronger social relationships , happy productivity .
Fantastic .
You know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of Warcraft player plays 22 hours a week .
So as part @-@ time job .
The reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier working hard .
As if we &apos;re relaxing or doing nothing .
We know that we work optimally as human beings .
When we do hard , significant work , and players are always ready to work hard .
When they get the right job , and eventually epic meaning , players love it , part of awe .
Herring .
Missions of planetary dimensions .
Here &apos;s a background information to put that in perspective .
You probably know all Wikipedia .
The biggest Wiki in the world .
The second largest Wiki in the world with almost 80,000 entries is :
The World of Warcraft Wiki : Five million people use it every month .
They have more information about World of Warcraft .
Collected on the Internet than about any other topic in any other Wiki in the world .
They create an epic story .
They create an epic source of knowledge about the World of Warcraft .
OK .
So these are four superpowers that lead to a single result .
Players are super @-@ powerful , hopeful individuals .
They &apos;re people .
They believe that as individuals they can change the world .
And the only problem is they believe .
They can change the virtual worlds .
But not the real ones .
That &apos;s the problem I &apos;m trying to solve .
Edward Castronova is a scientist , and his work is brilliant .
He &apos;s studying .
Why people spend so much time , energy and money on online worlds ?
And he says , &quot; We &apos;re witnessing no less than mass migration to virtual worlds . &quot;
And online gaming environments , and this by an economist , so he &apos;s logical .
And he doesn &apos;t say the way I do .
I develop games .
I &apos;m a little bit exuberant .
So he says , &quot; That makes sense . &quot;
Because players can do more in online worlds than in real life .
They can build stronger social ties in games than in real life .
They get more feedback and rewards .
So in games than in real life , he says , &quot; It &apos;s perfectly logical right now that players spend more time in the virtual world than in real life . &quot;
I agree .
That &apos;s logical .
But it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
We need to start turning the real world into a game .
My inspiration comes from an event .
The 2nd .
500 years .
It &apos;s back .
There are these ancient cubes .
Sheepcrumbs .
You know , before these fantastic game econtrollers , there were sheep &apos;s necks .
And these were , so to speak , the first people to develop .
Play equipment .
And if you &apos;re familiar with the works of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus .
You may know ?
This story , the story about how and why games were invented .
According to Herodotus , games became more accurate cube games in the kingdom of Lydia .
During a famine , there was supposedly such a great famine that the king of Lydia decided to become a crazy idea .
People suffered , people fought .
It was an extreme situation .
It took an extreme solution .
So they invented according to Herodotus .
The dice game and agreed a national strategy .
In one day you would eat .
The next day you would play .
And they would be so deeply immersed in the dice game .
Because games are so fascinating and surrounded by satisfying , happy productivity that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
And then the next day you would play .
And the next day you would eat .
And according to Herodotus , they survived for 18 years .
This famine by eating one day and playing the next , I think , we &apos;re going to put it in the same way .
Today , we &apos;re going to play .
We &apos;re going to play games to escape the suffering of the real world .
We &apos;re going to play games to escape everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world .
It &apos;s not satisfying to anything that &apos;s not in real life .
And we &apos;re going to get what we need .
From the games .
But that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
That &apos;s the exciting thing .
According to Herodotus , after 18 years of famine , it wasn &apos;t getting any better .
So the king decided to start a final dice game .
They shared the kingdom .
In two halves .
They played a dice game .
And the winners were allowed to be an epic adventure .
They left lydia and they went to search for a new home .
They just left as many people as there were food to survive .
And they went to the rest of them to find an area where they could thrive .
That sounds crazy , right ?
But the latest DNA evidence shows that the Etruscans who later formed the Roman Empire .
They have the same DNA as the old lydians .
So scientists recently came to the conclusion that herodotus is actually a crazy story .
And geologists found evidence of global cooling that lasted almost 20 years , which could explain famine .
So this crazy story could be right .
Maybe they actually saved their people by playing by escaping into games for 18 years .
And then they had this inspiration and learned so much about playing with each other that they saved the whole civilization .
So we can .
We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft since 1994 .
This was the first real @-@ time strategy game .
The World of Warcraft series .
This was 16 years ago .
They played craps for 18 years .
We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft for 16 years .
I &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic .
Game .
So they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world .
So I take my 21 billion hours of play a week .
We should agree that half of us spend an hour a day playing .
Until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world .
I know you &apos;re going to ask , how do we solve problems ?
The real world in games .
And that &apos;s exactly the question I &apos;ve been working on in recent years at the Institute for the Future .
We have this banner in our office in Palo Alto .
It expresses how we should understand the future .
We don &apos;t want to try to tell the future what we want before .
Is the future to be created ?
We want to imagine the best possible outcome .
And then empower people to turn this idea into reality .
We imagine epic victories and give people the opportunity to reach them .
I &apos;ll show you very briefly three games that I &apos;ve designed to try to make people epic victories .
In their own future , this is world without oil .
The game is 2007 .
It &apos;s an online game where you have to overcome oil shortages .
Oil shortages are invented .
But we have enough online content to make it realistic for you .
And you actually live your real life without oil .
So if you sign up for the game , tell us where you live .
And then you get real @-@ time news films showing you how much oil costs , what it doesn &apos;t exist .
How food supplies are affected , how transport is .
Whether schools are closed , whether there are riots .
And you have to figure out how to shape your real life .
If it were true , and we ask you to blog about it , to hire videos or photos .
We tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 .
And we &apos;ve been accompanying them for the last three years .
And I can tell you , it was a changing experience .
Nobody wants to change their lives because it &apos;s good for the environment .
Or ...
Because we should .
But if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and you &apos;re told , &quot; We &apos;re going to get oil out . &quot;
This is a fascinating adventure you &apos;re going to go to .
Find out how you would survive .
Most of our players have kept the habits learned in the game .
So we &apos;re going to go for the next world saving game .
We &apos;ve set a bigger , higher goal than just oil shortages .
We &apos;ve developed the Superstruct game at the Institute for the Future .
The starting point is to calculate a supercomputer that people have only 23 years left on the planet .
This supercomputer is called Global .
Existence / Sensitization System .
Of course , the call to players to sign up .
Did we almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie ?
You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies , where there &apos;s the dream team .
You have the astronaut , the scientist , the ex @-@ StrÃ¤fling , and just together .
Can you save the world ?
But in our game .
Instead of just five people , we say , &quot; Everyone is on the dream team . &quot;
And it &apos;s our job .
To create the future for energy , food , health , safety and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game .
For eight weeks .
They found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read .
If you Google Superstruct and the last game , we &apos;ll release it on March 3rd .
It &apos;s a game in collaboration with the World Bank .
When you complete the game , you get the World Bank award for social .
Reformer : 2010 graduation .
We work with universities all over Sub @-@ Saharan Africa and invite you to learn how to redesign socially .
We have a comic book on this .
We have levels high for regional understanding .
Knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
I want to invite you all to share this game with young people .
All over the world , especially in development areas .
They benefit from imagining their own social ventures together to save the world .
So I &apos;m going to finish .
I want to ask you something : What do you think is happening ?
Next .
We have all these fantastic players .
We have games that show us what we can do .
But we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
Well , I hope you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life .
And that games have a big impact on change .
We have all these superpowers , happy productivity .
The ability to build tight social networks , urgency optimism .
And the desire for epiepical meaning .
I really hope that together we play important games to survive another century on this planet .
And I hope you will design and play with me these games .
If I look forward to the next decade , I &apos;m sure that we can create any imaginable future and that we can play all kinds of games .
So I &apos;m saying , let &apos;s play the world @-@ changing games .
Let &apos;s start .
Thank you .
I &apos;ve been interested in Placebo for some time .
It may seem strange that a magician is interested in it .
Unless you look at it like me as a deception that becomes something real .
If someone just believes it hard enough , in other words , have sugar pills .
In some studies , a measurable effect has been the placebo effect , and that &apos;s just because of it .
Because the person thinks what happens to her is .
A pharmaceutical or some kind of pain management .
For example , if the patient believes in it only firmly enough , there &apos;s a measurable effect in the body that &apos;s called the placebo effect .
A deception becomes something real because somebody perceives it so that we want to understand each other .
So I &apos;m going to show you a basic , very simple magic trick .
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works .
This is a trick that has been for kids in every magic book since at least the 1950s .
I myself have it from the Cub Scout Magic .
The scout in the 1970s .
I &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
And then I &apos;m going to explain why I explain it .
So you see what happens .
The knife you can study .
My hand you can study .
I &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my fist .
I &apos;m going to push my sleeves back .
And to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeves or comes out of it , I &apos;m just going to push my wrist right here .
So you can see that at no time is anything moving .
As long as I &apos;m pressurizing here , nothing can go into my sleeves or come out .
And the goal is very simple .
I &apos;m going to open my hand .
And hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife is held by my bare physical magnetism .
It &apos;s actually so tight .
In its place , I can shake it without the knife falling down .
Nothing moves .
In my sleeves , or comes out , no trickery .
And you can study everything .
TA @-@ DA : Well , this is a trick I often teach small kids who are interested in magic .
Because you can learn a lot about deception .
If you look more closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick to do .
I think many of you here in the room probably know .
This trick , it works like this .
I hold the knife .
In my hand , I say I close my wrist to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeve or comes out .
And this is a lie .
The reason I tie my wrist is because it &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
The moment I turn my hand away from you , so you see it moving from behind .
This finger , my index finger , just moves from where it was to a position where it &apos;s stretched out like this .
Great trick at the back .
Is there somebody who didn &apos;t have a childhood sitting ?
So he &apos;s right here .
And when I turn around , the finger changes its position .
And now you could talk about why this is a deception .
Why not realize that there are only three fingers down here , because the mind and the way it processes information doesn &apos;t count them individually .
One , two , three , but it sees them as a group .
But that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about .
Now here .
Actually not at all .
And then I open my hand .
Of course , it &apos;s held there .
But not by the magnetism of my body , but by a trick , by my index finger , which is there now .
And when I close my hand , the same thing happens by turning back , it &apos;s hidden by this movement that the finger moves back .
I take that hand away .
And here &apos;s the knife .
This trick you can show to your friends and neighbors .
Thank you .
Now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ?
A year ago or so , I read a study that really cut me around .
I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher .
And so for me , this was an amazing thing .
Because it turned out this is :
If you offer a placebo in the form of a white pill in the form of an aspirin tablet , it &apos;s just a round of white pill that has a certain measurable effect .
But if you change the shape in which you give placebo , for example , into a smaller pill .
And color those blue and embossing a letter on it , it &apos;s actually measurable , more effective .
And that , though none of them are any pharmaceutical .
They &apos;re just sugar pills .
But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
What made me really freak out of it .
But it turned out that &apos;s not all of it .
If you take capsules , they &apos;re even more effective than tablets .
Any shape , a colored capsule , at one end yellow .
And at the other red is better than a white capsule .
Dosage also plays a role . A pill twice a day is not as good as three pills .
I can &apos;t get to the exact statistics now .
Remember ?
Sorry .
The key thing .
But is that doses also play a role .
And the shape plays a role .
And if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to grab the needle .
Right ?
An injection with an ineffective , a few milliliters of an ineffective substance that you inject into a patient .
This creates a very strong image .
In the head , this is much stronger than a white pill .
This graph is really .
I &apos;m going to show you another time .
So if we have a projector , the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill .
It doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
And none of this has any really pharmaceutical property .
It &apos;s just our belief in it that has a stronger effect in us .
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a magic trick .
I take something that is obviously a deception and make it look real .
We know from that study that you have to grab the needle .
If you want to get to the point , this is an 18 @-@ inch @-@ long needle .
It &apos;s very , very sharp .
And I &apos;m going to sterilize it a little bit first .
This is really my flesh .
It &apos;s not Damian &apos;s special farmed meat .
This is my skin .
This is not a special effect .
Hollywood .
I &apos;m going to stick this needle in my skin and drive through it until it &apos;s going to get out on the other side .
If it gets you sick , if you &apos;re easily fainted .
I have a couple of friends .
Last night .
Show it in the hotel room .
And some people I didn &apos;t know , and there &apos;s a woman almost fainthead .
So I propose , if you &apos;re getting sick quickly , look away for the next 30 seconds .
Or ...
You know what ?
I &apos;m going to do the first delicate part back here .
You can do it in a moment .
But you can also look away .
So if you want , it &apos;s going to be just where my meat starts .
On the lower part of my arm , I &apos;m just going to do a little bit of a little bit of a while .
I &apos;m really sorry .
Is it crazy ?
And just a little bit through my skin .
And on the other side , I &apos;m going to get out of it again .
Now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had with the knife trick .
About , but now you can &apos;t count my fingers .
Or ...
So I &apos;m going to show you .
This is one , two , three , four , five .
Well , I know what people think .
If you see this , you say , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s certainly not so stupid . &quot;
And it just stirs through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes .
Well , then I &apos;ll show you .
What does this look like ?
Very good .
Yes .
I know .
And people back there say , &quot; Okay . &quot;
I didn &apos;t really see that .
People in the adjoining rooms are coming in now . Let me show you from near .
This is really my skin .
This is not a special effect .
Hollywood .
This is my flesh .
And I can turn this around . Sorry .
When you get bad , look away .
Don &apos;t look at it .
People in the back , or those who will see this on video at some point in the future , will say :
Well , yes .
That looks pretty much right .
Impressive .
But if it were real , he would see , here &apos;s a hole .
And there , if it was really real , it would bleed .
Okay .
Let me give you a little blood .
Squeeze out , yeah .
Here it is .
Normally I would take out the needle now .
I would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds there .
But I think in this frame here , and with the intention of making something real out of a deception , I &apos;m just going to leave the needle in there .
And so , from the stage , we &apos;re going to meet again a few times in the next few days .
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that .
Thank you very much .
So I &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
I just loved two .
This first one was more like a passionate affair .
It was a beautiful fish .
It was tasty .
Good consistency .
Hold .
Best seller .
On the menu .
What better fish !
It was bred in aquaculture according to the supposedly highest standards of sustainability .
So you could feel comfortable selling it .
I had a relationship with this beauty for several months .
One day , the company &apos;s CEO called and asked if I could talk at an event about the sustainability of the farm .
Of course , I said , &quot; Here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem has become for our chefs .
How do we keep fish on our menus ?
Over the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the seas , how we &apos;ve been barking forests .
It &apos;s hard to overstate the destruction : 90 percent of the big fish we love .
The tuna , the curative butte , the salmon , the swordfish .
They &apos;ve collapsed .
There &apos;s almost nothing left .
So aquaculture is likely to become bad or bad .
Fish growing .
It &apos;s going to be part of our future .
Many arguments against it : Fish farming plants pollute the environment .
Most of them .
Anyway .
And they &apos;re inefficient .
Let &apos;s take tuna at a great disadvantage .
It &apos;s got 15 percent feed recovery . One .
That means .
15 pounds .
Wild fish are needed to get one pound of farmed tuna .
Not very sustainable , not very good tastes either .
So here was finally a company .
It tried to get it right .
I wanted to support them .
The day before the event , I called the head of the public relations for the company .
Let &apos;s call him .
Don Don , I just said .
Just to get the facts .
Right ?
You &apos;re famous for that .
Growing out in the sea so far that you don &apos;t pollute the environment .
That &apos;s true , he said .
We &apos;re so far out that the waste is distributed by our fish , not concentrated .
And then he added .
We &apos;re basically a world of our own .
This 2.5 percent feed recovery to one percent , he said , &quot; The best in the industry . &quot;
2.5 to one , great , 2.5 to one , what feeds ?
&quot; Your sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; Great , &quot; he said . &quot; I put up , and that evening I lay in bed and thought , &quot; What the hell is a sustainable protein ? &quot;
So the next day I called .
Just before the Don event .
I said , &quot; Don , what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
He said , &quot; He doesn &apos;t know . &quot;
He &apos;s going to ask .
Well , I telephoned a few people in the company .
Nobody could give me a proper answer .
Until I finally telephoned with the leading biologist , we call him the same .
Don Don , I said , &quot; What , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
Well , he mentioned some algae .
And some fishmeal .
And then he said , &quot; Chicken pellets . &quot;
I said , &quot; Chicken pellets . &quot;
He said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; Feathers , skin . &quot;
&quot; Bone flour . &quot;
&quot; Remnants dried . &quot;
&quot; And processed into food . &quot;
I said , &quot; How much percent of your food is chicken ? &quot; Assuming maybe two percent ?
&quot; Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
I said , &quot; Don , what &apos;s sustainable about feeding chicken to fish ? &quot;
There was a long break in the pipeline .
And he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chicken in the world .
I fell in love with that fish .
No .
Not because I &apos;m a self @-@ righteous connoisseur and a good man .
I &apos;m even that . &quot;
No .
I really fell in love with this fish because I swear to God who tasted fish after this conversation after chicken .
This second fish .
This is another kind of love story .
It &apos;s the romantic species , the way you get to know your fish the better you love the fish the more .
I ate it first in a restaurant in southern Spain .
A friend journalist had long talked about this fish .
She kind of cuffed us .
He came to the table with a bright one .
Almost shimmering .
White one .
Color .
The cook had cooked it .
Hold twice . Amazingly , he was still delicious .
Who can make a fish ?
So good to taste after it was cooked .
I can &apos;t .
But this guy can call it Miguel .
In fact , he &apos;s called Miguel , and no .
He didn &apos;t cook the fish .
And he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way you and I understand it .
He &apos;s a biologist at Veta La Palma .
This is a fish rearing in the southwest corner .
Spain , it &apos;s near the mouth of the river Guadalquivir , until the 1980s .
The farm in the hands of Argentines .
They grew meat cattle on what were basically wetlands .
They did this by draining the country .
They built this complicated sequence of canals .
And they pushed water out of the country and out .
In the river .
Now , they couldn &apos;t make it work . It wasn &apos;t economically and ecologically viable . It was a disaster .
It killed about 90 percent of the birds .
What a place .
Many birds are .
And so in 1982 , a Spanish company with environmental awareness .
It bought the land .
What did they do ?
They reversed the river of water .
They literally relaid the lever .
Instead of pushing the water out , they used the channels to reconnect the water .
They flooded the channels .
They created an 11,000 hectares of fish rearing , perch , sea ash , shrimp , eel .
And so Miguel .
And his company , the ecological destruction , completely reversed .
The farm is incredible .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
You &apos;re staring out at the horizon , which is a million miles away .
And all you see are flooded canals .
And this dense , lush march .
I was there , not long ago , with Miguel .
He &apos;s an incredible guy .
Three parts .
Charles Darwin .
And one part , a crocodile for kissing .
Okay .
There we were , and we fought through the wetlands .
And I chash and sweat , I have mud up to my knees , and Miguel keeps calm .
A biology lecture here , he highlights a rare track .
Now he mentions the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
And here he sees a pattern of bundles that bind him to Tanzanian giraffe .
It turns out Miguel spent most of his career in Mikumi National Park in Africa .
I asked him how he became a fish expert .
He said , &quot; Fish , I don &apos;t know about fish .
I &apos;m an expert in relationships .
And then he goes and falls into more talk about rare birds and algae .
And strange aquatic plants , and don &apos;t get me wrong . &quot;
That was really fascinating .
You know , the biotic community , unplugged , like this , it &apos;s great .
But I was in love .
And my head got weak about this cooked piece of delicious fish that I had on the eve .
So I interrupted it .
I said , &quot; Miguel . &quot;
How does it come about that your fish tastes so good ?
He pointed to the algae .
I know boy , the algae of phytoplankton .
The relationships
That &apos;s incredible .
But what do your fish eat ?
How is the recycling of feed ?
Well , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
The plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton .
That &apos;s what the fish feed .
The system is so healthy .
It &apos;s completely self @-@ explanatory .
There &apos;s no food .
Ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , later on the day I drove .
On this plot with Miguel around .
And I asked him .
I said , &quot; For a place that seems so natural , unlike any farm I &apos;ve ever been to .
How do you measure success ? &quot; At the moment , it was as if a film director had demanded a change of stage .
And we were bowing around the corner , and we had the most incredible sight .
Thousands and thousands of pinkers flamingos , literally pinker carpet .
As far as the eye can see , that &apos;s success .
He said , &quot; Look at their bellies . &quot;
Pink .
They &apos;re smuggling , slugging .
I was completely confused .
I said , &quot; Miguel , don &apos;t smuggle your fish . &quot;
Yes , he said .
We &apos;re losing 20 percent of our fish .
And fish eggs to birds .
Now , last year , on this plot , 600,000 birds were more than 250 different species .
It &apos;s the largest one today .
And it &apos;s become one of the most important private bird reserves in Europe .
I said , Miguel is a well @-@ thriving bird population , not .
The last one you want to have on a fish rearing is he shook his head .
No .
He said , &quot; We &apos;re building extensively , not intensively .
This is an ecological network .
The flamingos eat the shrimps , the shrimps eat the phytoplankton the more pink . &quot;
So the belly , the better .
The system .
Okay .
Let &apos;s think about that .
A farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals .
And a farm that measures its success in the health of its predators .
A fish rearing , but also a bird reserve .
Oh , and by the way , these flamingos shouldn &apos;t even be there from the outset .
They breed in a city 240 kilometers away , where the soil is better .
For nest maintenance every morning , they fly 240 kilometers to the farm .
And they fly every night .
They fly 240 kilometers back .
They do that because they can follow the white line that &apos;s yesterday on the A92 highway .
Seriously .
I had imagined a kind of penguins journey .
So I looked at Miguel .
I said Miguel .
Fly them .
240 kilometers to go .
The farm , and then fly them .
240 kilometers back .
In the evening , they do that for the kids .
He looked at me as if I had just quoted a song by Whitney Houston .
He said , &quot; No .
They do that . &quot;
Because the food is better .
I didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish .
It was delicious , and I don &apos;t like the skin of fish .
I don &apos;t like it , it &apos;s not sucked .
I don &apos;t like it crispy .
It &apos;s this biting , charcoal taste .
I almost never cook with it .
And yet , when I tried it in this restaurant in southern Spain , it didn &apos;t taste for fish skin at all .
It tasted sweet and pure as if you were taking a bite from the ocean .
I mentioned that to Miguel .
And he nodded .
He said , &quot; The skin looks like a sponge . &quot;
It &apos;s the last defense before anything enters the body .
It &apos;s evolved over the course of evolution to suck up impurities .
And then he added , &quot;
But our water has no impurities .
Okay .
A farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish .
A farm that measures its success in the success of its predators . &quot;
And then I realized that when he says , &quot; A farm that doesn &apos;t have impurities , it undermines enormously . &quot;
Because the water that flows through this farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River .
It &apos;s a river that carries all the things that rivers tend to do with them today .
Chemical pollutants , outflow of pesticides .
And when it &apos;s fought through the system and it leaves , the water is cleaner than it &apos;s come in .
The system is so healthy .
It cleans the water .
So not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals .
Not only a farm that measures its success in the health of its predators , but a farm that is literally a water treatment plant .
And not only for these fish , but also for you .
And me .
Because when the water flows out , it sinks into the Atlantic , a drop in the ocean .
I know .
But I take it .
And you should do that .
Because this love story , however romantic , is also instructive .
You could say it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food .
Whether we &apos;re talking about beef or meat cattle , what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , of one in which food is .
In fact , taste good .
But for many people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
We &apos;re not realists .
We enjoy .
We &apos;re lovers .
We love weekly markets .
We love little ones .
Family farms .
We talk about regional food .
We eat .
Bio . And if you say that &apos;s the stuff that insure the future of good food .
Someone somewhere up and says , &quot; Hey guys , I love pinke flamingos . &quot;
But how are you going to feed the world ?
How are you going to feed the world ?
Can I be honest .
I like this question .
Not .
No .
Not .
Because we &apos;re already producing enough calories to feed the world more than just feed .
A billion people will starve today .
A billion .
That &apos;s more than ever before .
Because of stark inequalities in distribution , not total production .
Now , I don &apos;t like this question because it has determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
Feed grain to plant @-@ eaters , pesticides to monocultures , chemicals to the Earth , chicken to fish , and all the time , the agricultural industry has just asked .
If we feed more people cheaper , how horrible can that be ?
That was the reason .
It was the justification .
It was the business plan of American agriculture .
We should call it what it is .
A business in liquidation , a business that quickly takes up ecological capital that allows that very production .
That &apos;s not a business .
And it &apos;s not agriculture .
Our grain chamber is now threatened not by decreasing supply , but by decreasing resources .
Not by the latest Moravian and Tractor inventions , but by fertile land .
Not by pumps , but by fresh water , not by chainsaws , but by forests .
And not by fishing boats .
And nets , but by fish in the sea .
They want to feed the world .
Let &apos;s start with the question .
How are we going to feed ourselves , or better ?
How can we create conditions that enable each community to feed itself to do that ?
Don &apos;t look at the agricultural industrial model for the future .
It &apos;s really old .
And it &apos;s done .
Capital , chemistry and machines are at the top of it .
And it never really produced good food .
Instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
This is what goes back two billion years of work experience .
Look at Miguel .
Farmers like Miguel , farms that are not worlds for themselves .
Farmers that restore .
Instead of using up farms that grow extensively .
Instead of just intensive farmers who are not just producers , but experts in relationships .
Because they are the ones who are experts on taste .
And if I &apos;m really honest , they &apos;re a better cook .
When I ever will be , you know , I &apos;m right .
Because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
Thank you .
I grew up with a lot of science fiction , and in my school days , I went to school by bus , every day , one hour per way .
And my nose was always in a book , a science fiction book .
That kidnapped my thoughts into other worlds and narratives .
My deep @-@ seated insatiable curiosity satisfied this curiosity , and it also became apparent that whenever I wasn &apos;t in school , I would always stroll through the woods and collect samples , frogs and snakes and beetles .
And bring pond water home .
And under the microscope , I looked at it , I was totally science @-@ thrilled .
You know , it was always about trying to understand the world .
And exploring the limits of what was possible , and my love of science .
Fiction seemed to reflect in my environment .
Because back in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea , Jacques Cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows showing us animals and places and a world full of wonders that we could never have imagined before .
So that probably fits very well with that science fiction role .
And I was an artist .
I could draw .
I could paint .
And because it &apos;s neither video games nor this saturation with computer @-@ generated movies , nor the whole visual language .
In the media landscape , I had to create the images in my head .
That &apos;s what we all had to do at the time .
When we read a book as kids , we took the author &apos;s description and projected it onto the screen .
In our minds , my reaction was drawing and painting alien alien worlds , robots , spacecraft .
And all of that .
In math class , I was constantly caught by the teacher .
As I was hiding around in the textbook , creativity had to go out somehow , and it was happening .
Something interesting that fascinated me about Jacques Cousteaus &apos; shows was .
The idea of a world that we don &apos;t know about here on our planet .
Even certainly , I would never reach an alien world with a spaceship .
That seemed pretty unlikely to me .
But here was a world that I could actually enter .
Here on Earth , and it was just as fascinating and exotic as all that I &apos;d always imagined .
When I read these books , so when I was 15 , I decided to become a diver .
The only problem with this was that I lived in a small village in Canada , 1,000 kilometers from the next ocean .
But I didn &apos;t let myself be discouraged by this .
I annoyed my father until he finally found a diving school in Buffalo , New York .
Right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
I made my diving certificate in a pool of YMCA in Buffalo , New York , in the middle of winter .
But the ocean , a real ocean , I only got to see two years later .
When we moved to California , since the 40 years that have passed , I &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours underwater .
500 hours of this in submersible boats .
And I &apos;ve learned that the deep sea world itself is so rich in fascinating life in the flatter oceans .
As we can hardly imagine , nature &apos;s imagination knows .
No limits .
Unlike our own miserable human imagination .
To this day , I feel the deepest awe for what I see on my dives .
And my love of the ocean continues at the same intensity as ever .
And ever since I was an adult , I chose a profession , it was filmmaking .
That seemed the best way to tell my inner urge to tell stories .
And with my need to create images , when I was a kid , I constantly drew comic books .
And so films were the way to bring images and stories together .
That fit together .
Of course , the stories I chose were from the science fiction field : Terminator , Aliens and Abyss . At Abyss , I could have my preference for the underwater world .
And I could connect diving to filmmaking .
So my two passions sort of intertwined . Something interesting happened .
At Abyss , to solve a narrative problem in this movie .
And that was , we had to create a kind of liquid water system .
Let &apos;s grab computer @-@ generated animation .
CG : What came out of this was the first computer @-@ generated soft surface figure ever to be seen in a movie .
The film didn &apos;t bring any money .
In fact , it just played its production costs .
But I noticed something fascinating .
The audience around the world was hypnotized .
The magic that was thought to be out of it , according to Arthur Clarke &apos;s law , is well known that advanced technology and magic can no longer be distinguished from each other .
So they saw something magical .
And I found that incredibly exciting .
And I thought , &quot; Wow , it &apos;s absolutely essential to integrate that into the film world . &quot;
So we went much further into Terminator 2 , my next movie .
Together with ILM , we created the guy there made liquid metal , and that success was hanging .
It was quite that .
How would that effect come about ?
And it worked .
Again , we had created something magical .
And the effect in the audience was the same .
But we already have a little more money with the film .
Recorded from these two experiences , a whole new world had been achieved .
A whole new world of creativity for filmmakers .
So I started a company with my good friend Stan .
Winston , who was the best make @-@ up and creature designer at that time .
It was called Digital Domain .
The basic idea of this company was to skip the phase of analog processes with optical printers , etc . , and to start digital productions in a moment .
And we did that , and we did it .
We did it for a while , and we did it for a competitive advantage .
But in the mid @-@ 1990s , we realized that we were in the Creature and Character Design , which we actually founded the company for .
We were moving too slowly .
I had written this piece of Avatar , which was supposed to shift the bar to new heights in terms of visual effects and computer @-@ generated effects .
It was with realistic , human expressive characters made using CG .
And the main characters were supposed to be all CG .
And the world was supposed to be CG .
But the bar pushed back pretty much .
And the people in my company told me that we were not yet able to do that for the time being .
So I shifted that , and I made this other movie about the big ship .
This goes down to the studio , and I sold that as Romeo and Juliet on a ship .
It became a love movie of epic proportions , a passionate movie , secret .
But did I actually want to be a real wreck ?
Dive down the Titanic .
That &apos;s why I made the film .
That &apos;s the truth .
The studio didn &apos;t know that .
But I convinced them by saying , &quot; We dive to the wreck . &quot;
We film the real wreck .
We &apos;ll show it in the opening sequence of the film .
That &apos;s incredibly important .
It &apos;s a good marketing tag .
And I persuaded them to fund an expedition .
Sounds crazy .
But that &apos;s back to the fact that your imagination can create a reality .
We actually created a reality six months later , where I found myself in a Russian submersible , four kilometers below the surface of the North Atlantic .
And I looked at the real Titanic through a bullet .
This was not a movie .
No HD .
This was real .
So this really blew me around .
And the preparations for this were enormous .
We had to build cameras and headlights and everything .
And I noticed how much these deep @-@ sea dive gears resembled a space mission .
Well , they were also high @-@ tech and needed more .
Planning : You go into this capsule .
Then you float down into this dark , hostile environment where there is no hope of salvation .
If you don &apos;t get it back yourself , and I thought , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s the same as if I were in a science fiction movie . &quot;
That &apos;s really cool .
I was really obsessed .
I was obsessed with exploring the deep sea , at least the part that has to do with curiosity and science .
It was all .
It was adventure .
It was curiosity .
It was imagination .
And it was an experience that Hollywood could not give me .
Because , you know , I could imagine a creature for which we could then create a visual effect .
But I couldn &apos;t imagine what I would see outside the window .
In some of the subsequent expeditions , I saw beings in thermal springs .
And sometimes things I &apos;d never seen before , sometimes things that nobody had ever seen before .
And for those who saw science at the time we saw it .
Not a word at all .
So that really turned me around .
And I wanted more .
And so I made a slightly unusual decision .
After the success of Titanic , I said , &quot; Okay , I want to put my main job as a filmmaker in Hollywood on ice , and I &apos;m going to be a full @-@ time researcher for a while . &quot;
And then we started planning these expeditions .
We went to Bismarck and we explored them with robotic vehicles .
We went back to the wreck of the Titanic .
We took small robots that we had built that were carrying out a fiberglass cable .
Our intention was to dive in and look at the inside of the ship .
What had never been done before .
Nobody had ever explored the inside of the wreck .
You had no means to do that .
So we developed the technology we needed .
NA and ?
I &apos;m sitting on the deck now .
The Titanic .
In a submersible boat , and I see planks that are quite similar to these boards here .
And of those I know the band once played there .
And I &apos;m flying through the aisles of the ship with a little robot vehicle .
I &apos;m actually just operating it .
But my consciousness is inside the vehicle .
It felt like I was physically present inside the Titanic ship wreck .
This was the surreal form of a dÃ©jÃ  vu I &apos;ve ever experienced .
Because before I was bogging around a corner , I always knew what would appear in the light cone of the vehicle .
Because I had walked over the movie set for months when we shot the film .
Because the set was an exact copy of the ship &apos;s blueprints .
So that was a very strange experience .
It made me realize that this tele @-@ presence experience was that you use robotic avatars like this .
And so your consciousness into the vehicle .
It can be moved into this other form of existence . It was really incredibly profound .
And maybe it could also be a little bit of a look at what might happen in a few decades .
If you have cyborg bodies to explore or do other things .
In all sorts of post @-@ human future scenarios that I can imagine as a science fiction fan .
After these expeditions , we started what we had seen down there .
Really appreciate learning .
For example , these deep @-@ sea equals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals .
These are , like , alien animals .
But here on Earth .
They live with chemosynthesis .
They don &apos;t exist in sunlight .
They exist in a system based on sunlight .
How do we do that ?
And so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees Celsius .
Hot water cloud live .
And you can &apos;t imagine they can survive there .
At the same time , I was also very interested in space science .
That was the science fiction influence again .
From my childhood , and so I ended up with the people who are interested in space .
And those who are involved with NASA and sit on NASA &apos;s expert board and plan real space missions .
They go to Russia , go through before the mission .
The biomedical protocol , and all the drum and everything , fly around .
Then to the International Space Station and take our 3D camera systems with you .
That was fascinating .
But in the end , it was going to mean that I took space scientists with us into the deep sea .
I took them and I scaled them into the world .
Down there , astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme situations .
I took them to the sources so they could look around , take samples and test instruments .
And so on .
We turned .
We did documentary films .
But actually science , more specifically space science , so the circle between my existence as a science fiction fan closed .
Back then , when I was a kid and I was a reality .
And as I went on this journey of discovery , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot about science .
But I also learned a lot about leadership .
Now , you probably think a director must be able to lead .
Being a guide , like a ship captain , or something like that .
But I didn &apos;t understand much about leadership .
Before I started these expeditions , because at a certain point , I had to say , &quot; What am I doing ? &quot;
Here .
Why am I doing this ?
What &apos;s coming out of this ?
These stupid movies don &apos;t bring us money .
We &apos;re just playing the production costs .
One of fame , no trace .
Everybody thinks I &apos;m between Titanic and Avatar .
I &apos;d walked away and I &apos;d kind of had the nails on a towel on the beach somewhere .
I &apos;ve made all these movies , these documentary films , for a very small audience .
No fame , no honor .
No money .
What are you doing ?
You &apos;re doing it for the sake of the task , for the sake of the challenge .
And the ocean is the most challenging environment that exists .
You &apos;re doing it for the discovery .
And because of the strange connection that emerges when a small group of people form a team .
Because we &apos;ve done all of this with just 10 to 12 people who have worked together for years and years .
Sometimes we &apos;ve been at sea for two to three months in a row .
And in this community , you realize that the most important thing is respect that you have for each other , because you &apos;ve done a job that you can &apos;t explain to anyone else .
When you go back to land and say , &quot; We had to do it . &quot;
The fiberglass , the sound attenuation .
And all around .
The whole technique .
And the difficulties , the human performance .
When you work at sea , you just can &apos;t explain that to others .
This is like policemen or soldiers who have gone through something in common .
And you know they can never explain it to anybody .
There &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
So when I came back to make my next movie , Avatar , I tried to apply the same leadership style , which is that you respect your team and in return deserve respect .
And that really changed the dynamics .
So I stood there again with a small team on unknown terrain .
We turned Avatar with a new technology that had not existed before .
It was incredibly exciting .
It was a tremendous challenge .
And we became a real family for a period of four and a half years .
And that changed my way of making films .
It changed completely .
There were people who thought we had these ocean properties .
Yes .
Really .
Good .
Tone .
And on the planet .
Pandora transports . For me , it was more of a principled way of doing my job .
The actual process that changed as a result .
So what can we conclude from all of this ?
What lessons have we learned ?
I think , first of all , curiosity .
It &apos;s the most powerful human property .
Our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
And the respect for your team is more important than all laurels .
This world comes to me : Young filmmakers .
They say , &quot; Give me a advice . &quot;
How can I do this ?
And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t limit you . &quot;
Even one that already gets others for you .
Don &apos;t do it .
Bet yourself not against yourself , but take risks for you .
NASA has such a favorite sentence .
Failure is not an alternative .
But in art and exploration , failure must be an alternative .
Because there it guarantees a positive outcome of trust .
No important undertaking .
Innovation was ever approached without risk .
You have to be ready .
Take risks like that .
That &apos;s the idea I &apos;d like to give you .
Failure is an alternative . Fear .
But is not one .
Thank you .
If I want to bring you one thing closer today , it &apos;s that the whole data we consume is larger than the sum of your parts .
And instead of thinking about overloading information , I want you to think about how we are information .
So use patterns to emerge .
And we see trends that would otherwise not have been visible .
So what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical death chart , arranged by age .
The program I &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
It &apos;s called Pivot .
And what I can do with Pivot is I can filter for a certain cause of death .
Let &apos;s say accidents .
And immediately I see another pattern that emerges , and that &apos;s because in the middle range , here , people are most active .
And they &apos;re most frail over here .
We can go one step further and sort out the data .
Then , new and see that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects .
But not for everybody .
Now , if we go further and sort by age , we say 40 years or younger .
Let &apos;s see that accidents are even the main cause .
People should be worried about them , and anyone who &apos;s researching can see that this is particularly true for men .
So you can see that the image of information and data in this way is very much swimming .
It &apos;s a vivid graphic of information .
And if we can do this for raw data , why not for content itself ?
So what we have here is the cover images of every single Sports Illustrated that have ever been printed .
It &apos;s all here .
It &apos;s all online .
You can test it after my talk in your rooms .
With Pivot , you can dive into a decade .
You can dive into a given year .
You can jump directly to a particular issue .
So if I look here , I see the athletes who are out in this issue and the sports .
I &apos;m a Lance Armstrong fan .
So I click here , which shows me all the issues that Lance Armstrong is mentioned .
Now , if I just want to get a bigger overview .
I think , OK , what ?
If I look at everything about cycling , so I take a step back and expand the view .
Now I see Greg Lemon .
And so you get an idea of how , if you look through this kind of information , you zoom out more targeted , wider , more pure .
You don &apos;t look for it or surf .
Not just .
You do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
It &apos;s something in between .
And we think it changes the way information can be used .
So I want to take this idea a little bit further .
So , with something a little bit crazy , what we &apos;ve done here is :
We &apos;ve taken every single wikipedia page and reduced it to a little summary .
The summary contains a short overview and a symbol of the area from which it comes .
I &apos;ll just show you one .
The top 500 of the most popular wikipedia pages .
But even in this narrow view , we can do a lot of things .
Immediately , we get an idea of the issues that are most popular on Wikipedia .
I &apos;m going to vote on the issue of government .
Now , after I &apos;ve elected government , I realize that the categories of wikipedia that cover most of it are Time Magazines , people of the year .
This is really important .
Because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single wikipedia page .
It &apos;s only to be seen .
If you go back a step and look at the whole thing , looking at one of these summaries , can I go into the theme of Time Magazines , &quot; People of the Year , &quot; and see everybody together ?
Now , if I look at all these people , I realize that the majority of them are government officials .
Some of them come from science .
Some of them come from economics even less .
Here &apos;s my boss .
And one comes from music .
And interestingly , Bono is also a TED Prize winner .
So we can jump and take a look at all the TED Prize winners .
You see , we &apos;re surfing the web .
The first time it &apos;s really a web .
Not only side by side , but much more abstract .
And so I want to show you something else that might be a little surprise .
I &apos;m just going to show you the New York Times website .
Pivot .
This application .
I don &apos;t want a browser .
It &apos;s really not a browser .
But you can look at websites with it .
And we bring this zoom technology to every single website like this .
So I can take a step back and jump directly to a specific section .
This is important because you can only look at websites in this way , look at the whole web process in the same way .
So I can zoom in into my web page in a certain time frame .
Here &apos;s the state of the whole demonstration that I &apos;ve been holding up to this point .
And I can sort of see everything I &apos;ve been looking at today .
I can get back again .
And when I go out and look at everything , I can rearrange my web page , maybe after my search past .
Here I &apos;ve been looking for nepotistic .
Here &apos;s Bing , or
Here &apos;s live Labs Pivot .
And from here I can go into the page .
And call it again .
It &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again .
And every time it makes the overall picture bigger than the sum of the data pieces .
Right now , in this world , we think data is a curse .
We talk about the curse of the abundance of information .
We talk about drowning in information .
What if we could turn this situation around ?
And turn the Internet upside down so that instead of always going from one to the other , we start .
From many things to many things to many things .
And by doing that , we can see patterns that would otherwise have been hidden .
If we can do this , this hitherto data trap may become a new source of meaningful information .
And instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge from it .
And if we know , then maybe we can even experience wisdom .
So I stop learning from that .
Thank you very much .
Everybody talks about happiness today .
I &apos;ve let some people count the number of books published with Happiness in the title over the last five years .
And they stopped after about 40 .
And there were many more .
There &apos;s a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
There &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching .
Everybody would like to make people happier .
But despite all this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps that make it almost impossible , so to speak .
Sure .
Thinking about happiness and my talk .
Today , these cognitive traps will be mostly about these .
This is true for laymen who think about their own happiness .
And it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness because it turns out we &apos;re just as confused as anyone else .
The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity .
It turns out that the word happiness is simply no longer a useful word .
Because we apply it to too many different things .
I think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could limit it to .
But by and large , this is something that we need to give up .
And we will need to take the complicated view .
What is well @-@ being ?
The second case is a confusion of experience and memory .
Basically , it &apos;s between happiness .
In his life and being happy about his life or happy with his life .
And these are two very different concepts .
And they &apos;re both thrown together .
In the notion of happiness , and the third is the concentration illusion .
And that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about one thing .
Well @-@ being affects without distorting its meaning .
I mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
There &apos;s just no way .
It &apos;s getting right .
Now I &apos;d like to start with an example from someone who had a question and answer session .
After one of my lectures , which was a story , it was unclear .
He said he &apos;d heard a symphony .
And it was absolutely wonderful music .
And at the very end of the recording , there was a terrible , creeping sound .
And then he added , &quot; Really , quite emotionally .
That &apos;s ruined the whole experience .
But that wasn &apos;t what it had ruined . &quot; Were the memories of the experience ?
He had the experience .
He had 20 minutes of wonderful music .
They didn &apos;t count because he had stayed with a memory .
The memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had been kept .
What this really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and about other people .
In the sense of two kinds of self .
There is a living self that lives in the present .
And the present is capable of experiencing the past again .
But basically , only the present is present . It &apos;s the living self that the doctor instigates .
You know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Is it hurting now ? &quot;
When I touch you here , and then there &apos;s a remembering self .
And the remembering self is that &apos;s what &apos;s mitzÃ¤hlt .
And keeps the story of our lives upright .
And it &apos;s the one that the doctor addresses by asking the question .
How did you feel lately ?
Or how was your journey to Albania ?
Or something like that ?
These are two very different units .
The living self .
And the remembering self .
And confusing the two is part of the coexistence of the term happiness .
Now , the remembering self is a storyteller .
And that really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memories .
It starts immediately .
We &apos;re not just telling stories .
When we make ourselves tell stories , our memory tells us stories .
That means that what we can keep from our experiences is a story .
And let &apos;s start with an example .
There &apos;s an old study .
These are real patients who undergo a painful procedure .
I &apos;m not going to go into detail .
It &apos;s no longer painful today .
But it was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
They were asked to report every 60 seconds about their pain .
And here are two patients .
These are their records .
And they &apos;re asked , who has suffered more from both ?
And this is a very simple question .
Patient B has suffered more clearly .
His intestinal reflection was longer .
And every minute of pain , the patient A had patient B and more .
But now there &apos;s another question : How much did these patients think they suffered ?
And here &apos;s a surprise .
And the surprise is that patient A had a much worse memory of intestinal reflection than patient B. The stories of intestinal reflections were different .
And because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
And none of these stories is very edible or great .
But one of them is clear .
But one of them is clearly worse than the other .
And the one that is worse was where the pain was at its peak at the very end .
It &apos;s a bad story .
How do we know that ?
Because we asked these people about their gut reflection , and much later on , how bad was it .
All in all .
And it was much worse for A than for B in memory .
Well , this is a direct conflict between the living self and the remembering .
Even from the perspective of the living self , B clearly had a worse time .
Now , what you could do with patient A .
And we actually did clinical experiments .
And it was done .
And it works .
You could actually extend patient A &apos;s intestinal reflection by just leaving the tube in there .
Without too much shake on it .
That will cause the patient to suffer , but only a little bit less than before .
And if you do that for a few minutes , you &apos;ve made the living person worse off even patient A .
And you &apos;ve made the memory self of patient A much better off .
Because now you &apos;ve given patient A a better story about his experience .
What does a story look like ?
And that &apos;s true of the stories that memory gives us .
And it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent , which are what makes a story special .
Breaks , significant moments and ends are very , very important .
And in this case , the end dominated .
Now , the living self is constantly living its life .
It has moments of experience one after the other .
And you ask , what happens to these moments ?
And the answer is really simple .
They &apos;re lost forever .
I mean , most moments of our lives .
And I &apos;ve calculated this . You know , the psychological presence is considered to be for about three seconds .
What does it mean ? Do you know that there are about 600 million of them in a life ?
In a month , there are about 600,000 .
Most of them leave no trace .
Most of them are completely ignored by the memory self .
And yet , somehow , they get the impression that they should count that what happens during these moments of experience .
Our life is it &apos;s the limited resource we consume .
While we are in this world and how we consume it , it would seem important .
But that &apos;s not the story that keeps the memory self for us .
So we have the memory self .
And the living self .
And they &apos;re really quite different .
The biggest difference between them is the way that time is handled from the perspective of the living .
Even if you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good as the first week .
Then the two @-@ week holiday is twice as good as the one @-@ week holiday .
That &apos;s not how it works at all .
For the remembering self , for the remembering self , a two @-@ week holiday is .
Hardly better than the one @-@ week holiday .
Because there are no new memories added .
You haven &apos;t changed the story .
And in this way , time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from a living self , has time .
Very little influence on this story .
Now , the remembering self makes more than remembering and telling stories .
It &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions .
Because if you have a patient who , let &apos;s say , has two intestinal reflections at two different .
Surgeons had , and decides , which one to choose .
Then there &apos;s the one who chooses , the one who has the memory that &apos;s less bad .
And that &apos;s the surgeon who will be selected .
The living self has no voice .
In this election , actually , we don &apos;t choose between experiences .
We choose between memories of experiences and even experiences .
When we think about the future , we think about our future .
Normally not as experiences .
We think about our future as anticipated memories .
And basically , you can look at that .
You know , as a tyranny of the memory self .
And you can think of the memory self .
As one that kind of drags the living self through experiences that the living self doesn &apos;t need .
I have the impression that when we go on vacation , it &apos;s very often the case , that is , .
We go on vacation as far as possible in the service of the memory self .
And that &apos;s a little hard to justify , I think .
I mean , how much do we feed from our memories ?
That &apos;s one of the explanations given for the dominance of the memory self .
And when I think about that , I think about a vacation we made a few years ago in Antarctica that was clearly the best vacation I &apos;d ever had .
And I think relatively often about how often I think about other vacations .
And I probably have my memories of this three @-@ week journey .
I would say , for about 25 minutes , I &apos;ve been driving in the last four years .
Now , if I &apos;d ever opened the folder with the 600 images in it , I &apos;d spent another hour .
Now , that &apos;s three weeks .
And that &apos;s at most one and a half hours .
There seems to be disagreement .
Now , I like to be a little extreme .
You know , in it , how little appetite I have for feeding memories ?
But even if you do more of that , there &apos;s a real question .
Why do we give so much weight to memories ?
In the scourge of weight that we give experiences .
So I want you to think about a thought experiment .
Imagine your next vacation .
You know that at the end of your vacation , all your pictures are destroyed .
And you get an amnesty drug , so you don &apos;t remember anything .
Now , you would choose the same vacation .
And if you chose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two kinds of self .
And you have to think about how you decide this conflict .
And that &apos;s really not obvious at all .
Because if you think about time , you get an answer .
And if you think about memories , you could get a different answer .
Why choose the vacations that we choose is ?
A problem that confronts us with a choice between the two types of self .
Now , the two kinds of self throw two terms of happiness .
There are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply .
One per self .
So you can ask , how happy is the living self ?
And then you would ask , how happy are the moments in the life of the living being ?
Even , and you &apos;re all lucky for moments .
Is a fairly complicated process ?
What are the emotions ?
Which can be measured ?
And by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea .
From happiness of the living self over time , when you ask about happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
This is not about how happy .
A person lives .
It &apos;s about how satisfied or happy .
The person is very different in terms of life when he thinks about his life .
Anyone who doesn &apos;t distinguish these terms will mash the research into happiness .
And I &apos;m a lot of researchers about well @-@ being who have long masked the research into happiness .
Right ?
This is the distinction between happiness of the living self and happiness of the remembering self .
In recent years , we &apos;ve been recognized , and now we &apos;re trying to measure the two separately .
The Gallup Organization has a global survey that asked more than half a million people questions .
What do you think about your life and your experiences ?
And there have been other efforts in that direction .
So in recent years , we &apos;ve started learning about the happiness of the two kinds of self .
And the main lesson we &apos;ve learned , I think , is that they &apos;re really different .
You can know how satisfied someone is with his life .
And that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happy he lives his life .
And vice versa .
Just to give you an idea of the correlation , the correlation is .
About five percent of what that means is that if you hit someone , and you would tell them , &quot; Oh , his father is a two @-@ meter man , how much ? &quot;
Would you know about his size ?
Well , you would know something about his size .
But there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
You have so much uncertainty .
If I tell you that somebody has classified his life as eight on a scale of 10 .
Do you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy ?
He &apos;s with his survivor .
So even the correlation is low .
We know something about what determines happiness self .
We know money is very important .
Targets are very important .
We know happiness is basically about being satisfied with people we like to spend time .
With people we like , there &apos;s other pleasure .
But that &apos;s dominant .
So if you want to maximize happiness of the two kinds of self .
Will you end up doing very different things ?
The conclusion from what I said here is that we really shouldn &apos;t imagine happiness as a substitute for well @-@ being .
It &apos;s a completely different term .
Now , very briefly .
Another reason why we can &apos;t think clearly about happiness is that we don &apos;t care about the same things .
When we think about life , and when we actually live , so when you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California , you won &apos;t get the right answer .
When you ask that question , you think that people in California need to be happier .
When you say , &quot; We live in Ohio , &quot; and what happens is when you think about life in California , you think about the difference between California and other places .
And that difference is , say , climate .
Well , it turns out climate is not very important to the living self .
And it &apos;s not even very important to the thoughtful .
Even that decides how happy people are . Well .
But because the thoughtful self is responsible , you can end up with some people .
At the end , they can move to California , and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track .
What happens to people who move to California ?
Hope to get happier . Well , their living self becomes .
Not happier . We know .
But one thing will happen .
You &apos;ll think you &apos;re happier .
Because if you think about it , you &apos;ll be reminded of how terrible the weather was in Ohio .
And you &apos;ll feel you &apos;ve made the right decision .
It &apos;s very difficult to think clearly about well @-@ being .
And I hope I &apos;ve given you an idea of how difficult it is .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
I have a question for you .
Thank you very much .
Now , when we telephoned a few weeks ago , you told me that there was a pretty interesting result that came from this Gallup survey , is that something you can share with us ?
Because you now have a few minutes left .
Daniel Kahneman : Sure .
I think the most interesting result we found in the Gallup survey is a number that we had absolutely not expected to find .
We found that in terms of happiness for the survivor himself .
When we looked at how feelings vary with income , and it turns out that under an income of 60,000 dollars a year for Americans .
And that &apos;s a very big sample of Americans .
About 600,000 .
But it &apos;s a big representative sample of an income of 600,000 dollars a year .
About 60,000 .
DK : 60,000 , 60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy .
And they &apos;re getting increasingly unhappy .
The poorer they get , we get an absolutely flat line about it .
I mean , I rarely saw such flat lines .
What happens is that money doesn &apos;t get you experience happiness .
But that lack of money certainly gives you misery , and we can measure this misery very , very clearly .
In the sense of the other self , the memory self , you get a different story .
The more money you make , the more satisfied you are .
That &apos;s not true of emotions .
CA : But Danny , throughout the American endeavor , it &apos;s about life .
Freedom , the aspiration for happiness .
If people were to take this finding seriously , I think it seems to turn everything on their head .
Everything we believe , for example , in tax policy .
And so on , there &apos;s a chance that politicians , that the country would generally take a finding like the seriousness .
And based on that , politics would do DK , you know ?
I think there &apos;s recognition .
The role of gambling research in politics , recognition will be slow .
In the United States , no question .
But in the United Kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now .
And in other countries , it &apos;s happening right now .
People are recognizing that they should think about happiness .
If you think about politics , it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to explore experience happiness , or whether they want to explore life assessment .
So we have to have this discussion pretty soon . How to increase happiness is very different .
Depending on how you think , and whether you think about the memory self , or whether you think about the living self .
That will affect politics .
I think in the coming years in the United States , you &apos;re tightening on the experience happiness of the population .
That , I think , will be part of national statistics in the next one or two decades .
CA : Well , it seems to me that this topic is going to , or should , be at least the most interesting political debate to follow over the next few years .
Thank you very much .
For the invention of behavioral economics .
Thank you .
Danny Kahneman : Today I &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
And that might surprise you a little .
Because my full @-@ time work at the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds , about the things we need to invent and deliver , about the poorest two billion .
To make a better life possible .
But energy and climate are extremely important .
In fact , for these people , even more important than for anyone else on the planet .
Climate degradation means that their seeds will not grow for many years , we will rain too much or too little .
Things will change as their fragile environment cannot endure .
That leads to starvation .
It leads to insecurity .
It leads to unrest .
So climate change will become terrible for them .
And also , the energy price is very important for them .
The fact is , if you could just reduce the price of one thing to reduce poverty , energy would be by far the most effective .
Now , the energy price has fallen over time .
In fact , the progress society is based on energy advances that drove coal evolution .
The industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid fall in the electricity price .
And that &apos;s why we have refrigerators .
Air conditioning : We can make modern materials .
And do so many things .
So we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
But if we reduce the price , we cut the price by half , we hit a new barrier .
And this barrier is related to CO2 , CO2 warms the planet , and the equation for CO2 is .
Actually , pretty clear .
They sum up .
The one that &apos;s emitted .
CO2 .
Which leads to temperature increase .
And this temperature increase has some very negative effects on the weather .
And perhaps worse , the indirect effect is that natural ecosystems cannot adapt to such rapid changes .
And so whole systems collapse .
Now , the exact link between a CO2 increase and the resulting temperature change , and where its further consequences lie .
There are some ambiguities .
But not very many .
And there &apos;s certainly uncertainty about how bad these consequences will be .
But they will be extremely bad .
I &apos;ve asked the top scientists several times , &quot; Do we really have to get down to near zero ? &quot;
&quot; Is not half or a quarter enough ? &quot;
The answer is , we get close to zero .
Will the temperature continue to rise ?
So it &apos;s a big challenge .
It &apos;s quite different from saying .
We have a 3.5 @-@ meter truck that &apos;s under a three @-@ meter bridge .
You have to squeeze it down , you can squeeze it down .
This has to be down to zero .
Now , we emit a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons .
Every American , about 20 tons of people from poor countries , less than one on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
And somehow we have to create changes that reduce that to zero .
It &apos;s been constantly increasing .
Just different economic ones .
Changes have actually affected it .
And we have to go from rapid growth to reduction and to a reduction to zero .
This equation has four factors : A little multiplication .
You have this thing on the left , CO2 , that you want to get to zero .
And that will depend on the number of people , on the services that every human being uses on average , the average energy for every service , and the CO2 emitted per unit of energy .
So let &apos;s look at each factor individually .
And let &apos;s think about how we get that to zero .
Probably one of these numbers has to come very close to zero .
Now , this is basic algebra .
But let &apos;s go through it .
First of all , we have the population today .
6.8 billion people .
And it &apos;s going to reach 9 billion , which is going to move to 9 billion .
If we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , healthcare and reproductive medicine .
Could we reduce that by 10 to 15 percent ?
But right now we &apos;re seeing a 1.3 percent rise .
The second factor is the services we use .
That includes all the food we eat : Clothing , television , heating .
These are very good things .
And poverty reduction means making these services accessible to almost everyone on the planet .
It &apos;s great that this number is rising in the rich world , in the top billion , we might be able to make cuts and use less .
But on average , this number is going to rise every year , and so it &apos;s more than doubling overall .
The number of services that are provided per person .
So here &apos;s a very basic service .
Is there light at home to read the homework ?
And these students don &apos;t have it .
So they go out and read .
Their homework under the street light .
Now , effectiveness , the E : The energy per service , finally there &apos;s good news .
We have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
Because of different successes in the lighting sector , because of other types of cars , because of new methods in building houses .
There are many services that you can drastically reduce their energy consumption .
103 : 00 05 50 000 GT 00 05 53 000
Some services can be reduced by 90 % .
Some individual services can be reduced by 90 % .
Other services , such as fertilisers ( 105 : 00 05 56 000 GT 00 05 58 000 ) or air transport or air transport , have a much smaller room for improvement .
Overall , if we are optimistic , we may get a 3 % reduction or perhaps even a 6 % reduction .
But in the first three factors , we are now at the very best from 26 billion to perhaps the very best .
13 billion tons went .
And that &apos;s just not enough .
So let &apos;s look at the fourth factor .
And this will be a key factor .
That &apos;s the amount of CO2 emitted per unit of energy .
The question is , can you get that to zero ?
If you burn coal , no , if you burn natural gas , no , almost every method of production emits electricity .
Today , CO2 , except renewable energy and nuclear energy .
So what we need to do at a global level is create a new system .
We need energy under .
Now , if I use the term &quot; miracle , &quot; I don &apos;t mean the impossible , the microprocessor is .
A miracle , the PC is a miracle .
The Internet and its services are a miracle .
People here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
Normally , there &apos;s no deadline for you to need a miracle by a certain date .
Normally , you &apos;re just standing next to it .
And some don &apos;t come to others .
But in this case , we have to give full gas and get a miracle in a very short time .
Well , I wondered , how can I really get this over ?
Is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that sparks the idea of people here ?
I remembered last year .
When I brought mosquitos , and somehow people liked that .
The idea became really tangible to them .
You know , there are people who live with mosquitos , and for energy , I noticed this .
I decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment this year .
So here are some natural fireflies .
I &apos;ve been assured they &apos;re not biting .
In fact , they &apos;re not even going to leave the glass .
Well , there are all kinds of game solutions like this .
But they &apos;re not all doing much .
We need solutions .
Either one or more of them have unimaginable scaling and unimaginable reliability .
And although there are many directions where people are looking for it , I really see only five of them who can make these big demands .
I &apos;ve omitted tides , geothermal fusion and biofuels .
They may make a moderate contribution .
And if they do better than I expect , that would be great .
But my key message here is that we need to work on all of those five .
And we can &apos;t give up on them because they intimidate us .
Because everybody has significant problems .
Let &apos;s first look at burning .
Fossil fuels : Burning either coal or natural gas .
What you have to do there may seem simple .
But that &apos;s not it .
You have to take all the CO2 that comes out of the chimney after burning .
You have to condense under pressure .
And then store somewhere and hope it stays there .
There are some pilot projects that can do that at a 60 / 80 level .
But getting it to 100 will be very difficult , and reaching an agreement on the storage of CO2 is a big challenge .
But the biggest problem .
Here &apos;s the storage time question .
Who will make sure ?
Who can guarantee something ?
What &apos;s literally many billion times bigger than any kind of waste you can imagine from nuclear and other things .
That &apos;s a lot of volume .
So this is a hard nut .
Next , nuclear energy , which also has three major problems .
The cost , especially in highly regulated countries , is high .
The question of security , that you really feel that nothing can go wrong .
Despite human cooperation , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
And then what do you do ?
With the waste .
Because although it &apos;s not very big , there are a lot of concerns .
People have to feel good about it .
184,00 10 20 000 GT 00 10 25 000 .
So three very difficult problems that might be solvable .
So three very difficult problems that may be solvable .
And so you should work on those , the last three of the five have .
So I &apos;ll summarize .
It &apos;s renewables .
As you &apos;re often called , and they also have , although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel .
They have some disadvantages . One is .
The energy density that these technologies generate is dramatically lower than that of power plants .
These are low @-@ energy .
You &apos;re talking about many square kilometers more space than a normal power plant .
And these sources are also subject to interruptions .
The sun doesn &apos;t shine all day long .
It doesn &apos;t shine every day either .
And the wind doesn &apos;t blow all the time .
So if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , you have to have a way to do that , even in times .
If it &apos;s not available , to get it .
So there are big price challenges here .
There are challenges in transmission .
For example , if we say that the energy source is outside the country , it &apos;s not just technology that you need .
You also have to deal with the risk that the energy comes from where it comes from .
And there &apos;s the storage problem .
And to show the dimension , I &apos;ve looked at all kinds of batteries that are made for cars , computers , cell phones , flashlights for everything .
And I &apos;ve compared that to the amount of electronic energy that the world uses .
I found that all the batteries that we &apos;re now producing store less than 10 minutes of total energy .
So could we need a big breakthrough here ?
Something that will be 100 percent better than the approaches to it .
Right now , that &apos;s not impossible .
But it &apos;s not that easy .
That &apos;s what happens when you try to get these interrupted sources to , say , 20 @-@ 30 percent of consumption .
If you want to rely on that 100 percent , you need an incredible wonder battery .
Now , where are we going to go ?
What &apos;s the right approach ?
A Manhattan project .
How do we get to the finish ?
What we need is a lot of companies working on it .
Hundreds of people in each of these five areas need at least 100 people .
For many , you &apos;ll say , they &apos;re crazy .
That &apos;s good .
I think there are many people in the TED group who are already engaged in this .
Bill Gross has several companies , including one called Esolar .
The great ones .
Solar thermal technologies have Vinod .
Khosla invests in dozens of companies .
They do great things and have interesting opportunities .
And I try to support that .
Nathan Myhrvold :
And I fund a company that maybe surprisingly has a nuclear approach .
There are some innovations in the nuclear sector that have modular , liquid development .
In this industry some time ago , it stopped , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts lie around , and the Terrapower concept means that instead of a part of the uranium , one percent , you have the U235 .
We decided to burn the 99 .
The U238 .
This is a pretty crazy idea .
But in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time .
But you could never simulate it sensibly .
Whether it would work , but since there are modern supercomputers .
Can you simulate it ?
And you can see that , with the right approach to matter , it looks like it works , and because you burn these 99 , it &apos;s like this .
The cost profile is much better .
In fact , you burn the garbage , and you can even use the garbage of today &apos;s reactors as a drive .
Instead of breaking your head over it , you just burn it a great thing .
The uranium is being used gradually .
A little bit like a candle .
You can see it &apos;s a kind of column .
It &apos;s often called a migratory wave reactor , which really solves the fuel problem .
Here &apos;s a picture of a place in Kentucky .
This is the waste .
The 99 .
You have the part that &apos;s burned today .
You have taken it out .
So it &apos;s called depleted uranium .
That &apos;s what drives the U.S. for hundreds of years .
And if you filter ocean water cheaply and easily , you get enough fuel .
For the rest of the planet &apos;s life .
You know , there are many challenges there .
But it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward .
Let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
What should our testimony look like ?
Well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to achieve .
And then we talk about the intermediate step .
Many talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
It &apos;s really , really important that we get there , the remaining 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still some agriculture .
Hopefully , forest threats and cement will be clean by then .
So to get there , the developed world , including countries like China , needs to completely transform their generation of electricity .
The other note says whether we &apos;re using zero emissions technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries .
And we &apos;re on the way to getting it to the rest .
That &apos;s super important .
That &apos;s going to be a key element .
This certificate , if we go back from there .
What should that look like in 2020 ?
It should contain the two elements again .
We should use the effectiveness measures to get reduction going .
The less we emit , the less CO2 we emit .
And so will the temperature .
But actually , this note is for the things we do , which do not completely lead to the big reductions .
Just equal or even a little less .
Important , like the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
We have to track these breakthroughs with full gas .
And we can measure that .
In company numbers , in pilot projects and regulatory changes .
There are many great books on this subject , Al Gore &apos;s book .
We have the choice , and David McKay &apos;s Sustainable Energy .
Without the Hot Air , they really go through it and create a framework where this can be widely discussed .
Because we need support from all sides to do that .
There are some things that need to come together .
That &apos;s a wish .
A very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
If you will allow me just one wish for the next 50 years .
I could choose the president , a vaccine .
And that &apos;s what I love .
Or I could choose that wish .
That &apos;s half @-@ energy price . Without CO2 , it &apos;s invented .
That &apos;s what I would like to see . This one has the greatest impact .
If we don &apos;t get that wish , the gap between long @-@ term and short @-@ term thinking people will become terrible .
Between the United States and China , between poor and rich countries , and almost all lives .
This 2 billion will be much worse .
So what do we have to do ?
What action do I appeal for ?
We have to work for more research funding .
When countries meet in places like coppenhages , they should not just talk about CO2 .
They should discuss this innovation strategy .
And they would be shocked by the ridiculous .
Low money spent on these innovative approaches .
We need market incentives , carbon taxes , CAP .
Amp ; Trade , something that sends a price signal .
We need to spread the news .
We need to have dialogue , rationality and completeness , and also the things that the government is doing .
It &apos;s an important wish .
But I think we can fulfill it .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Just to get a little better at understanding Terrapower .
First of all , you can give us an idea of the scale of this investment .
Bill Gates : To do the simulation on a supercomputer .
To get all the big scientists what we &apos;ve done , we just need a few 10 million .
And even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a Russian reactor to make sure it works properly .
Is it only in the 100 million that you &apos;re tough ?
Step by step , building the first reactor is finding billions more .
The regulations and the place that actually builds the first of them .
Once the first is finished , when it &apos;s going as promised , then it &apos;s all very clear .
Because the economic viability , the energy density , is as different as nuclear energy as we are .
You know .
CA : To understand that correctly .
That means building deep into the ground .
Almost like a vertical pillar of nuclear fuel .
This spent uranium , and then the process starts up and continues .
Down .
BG : Exactly .
Today , you have to refill the reactor .
So there are lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong .
This thing where you open it and bring things in or out .
That &apos;s not good .
But if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years .
Think of a column that you bury without all the complexities .
And it sits there and burns .
For 60 years .
And then it &apos;s done .
CA : A nuclear reactor that itself provides a solution to the garbage .
BG : Yeah .
Now what happens to the garbage ?
You can let it sit .
There &apos;s much less garbage .
With this method , then you take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it further .
And we start by taking the garbage that already exists , which is in these cooling basins or dry tanks , at the reactors .
That &apos;s our starting fuel .
So what was a problem for these reactors ?
What we do in our fill systems , and that &apos;s dramatically reducing the garbage volume .
During that process .
CA : But as you &apos;ve talked to different people in the world about these possibilities .
Where is the greatest interest ?
So , to actually implement this .
BG : Well , we haven &apos;t yet set ourselves in a place .
And there &apos;s a lot of interesting disclosure rules for everything .
The nuclear in the name is there . There &apos;s a lot of interest .
And the people of the company were in Russia , India , China .
I was here and I met the energy minister and talked about how this fits into the energy agenda .
I &apos;m optimistic .
You know , the French and Japanese have made something in the direction .
This is a variant of one thing .
It &apos;s been done . This is an important step forward .
But it &apos;s like a fast reactor .
And some countries have built this .
So anyone who has implemented a fast reactor is .
A candidature for our first one .
CA : In your imagination , timeframe and probability .
To really create this .
BG : Well , we need one of these scalable , power generating things that is very cheap .
We &apos;ve got 20 years to invent .
And then 20 years to deploy .
This is kind of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we need to comply with .
And you know , Terrapower , if everything goes well .
And that &apos;s a big wish .
Could that keep it easy ?
And fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds that work the same way when their approaches work .
The promotion for their pilots works for that .
It &apos;s best to offer , and it would be best .
If there are several , because then you could use a mix .
In any case , we need a solution .
CA : So , with regard to the big , possible breakthroughs , this is the biggest thing you know .
BG : An energy break is the most important thing .
It would have been without the environmental challenge .
But it makes it even more important in the nuclear sector .
Are there other innovative ones ?
Companies ?
You know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as these .
But there &apos;s the modular method .
That &apos;s a different approach .
There &apos;s a liquid reactor type that seems a little difficult .
But maybe they say that about us .
And so there are different ones .
But the nice thing about this is that a uranium molecule has a million times as much energy as a coal molecule , let &apos;s say .
And so if you can deal with the problems , and these are mainly the radiation of the footprint .
And the cost is the potential .
So the impact on the country and other things , almost in a league of its own .
CA : If that doesn &apos;t work , what do we have to do is take emergency measures to try and keep the Earth temperature stable ?
BG : When you get into this situation , it &apos;s as if you ate too much .
And you &apos;re about to have a heart attack , and what do you do ?
Then ...
You might need a heart surgery or something like that .
There &apos;s a research that &apos;s called geoengineering that &apos;s looking at different techniques to delay warming , so that we could get 20 or 30 years longer to get together .
That &apos;s just an insurance method .
You hope we don &apos;t need that .
Some people say you shouldn &apos;t work on insurance at all because you might be lazy , so you eat , because you know that the heart surgery will save you .
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart when you think about the importance of this problem .
But there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you should have that at your disposal .
If things get faster or if that innovation takes longer than we expect .
CA : Climate skeptics , do you have one or two sentences ?
For those around you , maybe to convince you .
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
Those who make scientific arguments are very little .
Tell them there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds .
Things shift .
There are very , very few things you can even say , of which there is a chance in a million .
The main problem here is similar to AIDS .
You make the mistake .
Now , and you pay for it much later .
And so the idea is now .
If you have all kinds of urgent problems to invest in something you have only later , and then the investment is not so clear .
In fact , the IPCC report is not necessarily .
The worst scenario .
And there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC and say , &quot; Okay .
This is not a big drama .
The fact is that this uncertainty should worry us . &quot;
But my dream here is that if you can make it economically and at the same time eliminate CO2 .
Then the skeptics also say .
Okay .
I &apos;m not interested in it emitting CO2 .
I almost wish it did .
But I &apos;m probably going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method .
CA : And that would be your answer to the BjÃ¶rn Lomborg argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve the CO2 problem , you can do it .
All the other goals , including poverty reduction , are suffering .
Combating malaria and so on , that it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources .
Investing money for it while there are better things we can do .
BG : Well , the actual spending on research , let &apos;s say , the U.S. should .
10 billion a year .
Expenditure more than you do today .
That &apos;s not so dramatic .
It &apos;s not something that other things should suffer from .
You get too much money .
And here , reasonable people can disagree .
If you have something that &apos;s not economic and you try to finance it .
For me , this is what &apos;s happening .
Most waste .
Unless you &apos;re very close to a breakthrough in cost , you &apos;re just funding the learning curve .
I think we should try more things that have the potential .
Very , much cheaper to be .
If the swab you get is a very high energy price .
Then only the rich can keep up .
I mean , each of us here could spend five times as much on our energy without changing our lifestyle .
For the bottom two billion .
But is it a disaster ?
And even Lomborg thinks , &quot; Well , to make his new mesh , why is research not being discussed anymore ? &quot;
He &apos;s still associated with the skeptic camp because of his earlier stories .
But he understood that this is a very lonely group .
And so he &apos;s now bringing the research argument .
And this is a thought that I think is appropriate .
Research , it &apos;s just crazy .
How little support is being given to this .
CA : Bill .
I think I speak for almost all the people here .
When I say , &quot; I really hope that your wish will come true . &quot;
Thank you very much .
BG : Thank you .
I &apos;d like to tell you something .
What I did a few months ago when I wrote an article for Italian .
Wired noticed , I always got my synonymous dictionary ready for writing .
But I was already done with editing the text .
And I noticed that I &apos;ve never looked at my life .
What the word &quot; obstructs &quot; really means : I read you the entry &quot; obstructed &quot; , &quot; adjective &quot; , &quot; crippled &quot; .
&quot; Helpless , useless , destroyed . &quot;
&quot; Deceased , mutilated , wounded , prepared . &quot;
&quot; Ham , separated , preserved , deserved , weakened , impotent , castrated , paralyzed . &quot;
&quot; Gegandicapt senil &quot; , &quot; age @-@ weak &quot; withdrawn , &quot; repaired &quot; , &quot; done , broken &quot;
&quot; Geborsten &quot; counted ( see also &quot; injured &quot; )
&quot; Useless and weak &quot;
&quot; Anonyme &quot; , &quot; healthy , strong &quot;
&quot; Efficient &quot;
I read this list out loud to a friend and had to laugh first .
It worked so ridiculous .
But I just got ready and couldn &apos;t speak any more and had to stop reading .
And first of all , gather me after this invincible flood of words and the emotional stuff that goes with it .
Shock .
Of course , this was a fractured old synonym dictionary .
I just thought that the issue has to be pretty old .
But in fact , it was an issue in the early &apos; 80s .
When I just started primary school , and that started my self @-@ image .
Outside my family environment , I started building and shaping .
Also in terms of other kids and the rest of the world around me .
And thank God , I didn &apos;t use a synonymous dictionary at the time , if I were to take this entry seriously .
If I were born into a world that someone like me would perceive as a person whose lives can &apos;t be positive in any way .
But today , I &apos;m going to be in favor of the opportunities and adventures I &apos;ve experienced .
So I immediately called the 2009 online edition and expected me to find a more appealing contribution here .
Here &apos;s the updated version .
This entry , dummy enough , is not much better .
In particular , the last two words shake me under Near Anonyms .
It &apos;s all healthy .
But it &apos;s not just about the words .
It &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with these words .
It &apos;s about the values that are in those words and how we construct those values .
Our language affects our thinking .
And how we see the world and the people around us .
Many ancient societies , including those of the Greeks and the Romans , really believed that the debate of a curse has a great force , because what you say loud can manifest itself .
So what do we actually want to manifest : A disabled person or a powerful person ?
People alone , a human being mindless .
To call them a child could be enough to limit them and give them ideas .
To put them over would not be more beautiful to open doors to them .
A human being who opened doors to me was my pediatrician .
At the A.I. DuPont Institute in Wilmington , Delaware .
His name is Dr. Pizzutillo , an Italo @-@ American whose name , you can imagine , is :
Most Americans couldn &apos;t speak correctly .
So he was always called Dr. P.
And Dr. P. always wore very colorful flies and was for working with kids .
Simply made like this .
I found the time I spent in this hospital just great .
Except for my physiotherapy .
I had to repeat individual exercises seemingly infinitely .
With these thick elastic bands in different colors .
You know that around .
Building my leg muscles , and I hated these bands more than anything else .
I hated them .
I cursed them .
I hated them and imagine .
I even negotiated with Dr. P. as a five @-@ year @-@ old kid .
And so this is how I try to stop these exercises .
Natural , without success .
And one day he watched me doing one of my exercises .
These exercises were just tiring and merciless .
And he said to me , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young .
Girl : You &apos;re going to tear one of these tapes one day .
And if you can do it , I &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
That was , of course , just a simple trick by Dr. P. to do the exercises I didn &apos;t want to do .
With the prospect of becoming the richest five @-@ year @-@ old girl in the hospital on the second floor .
But he actually got me to see my daily exercise horror with new eyes .
So it became a new and promising experience .
And I wonder today how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl .
Shaped my self @-@ image , and I could imagine myself as one of nature &apos;s strong , powerful and atlethic people .
This is just one example of many , like adults in power positions .
Instigate the imagination of a child .
But as the examples from the synonymous dictionaries that I &apos;ve already mentioned prove , our language doesn &apos;t allow us any space to imagine something .
What we all want would allow each and every one of us to see themselves as powerful people .
Our language lags behind the social changes that have , in many cases , been triggered by technological change .
From a medical point of view , of course , one can say that my legs , laser surgery for visually impaired , knee joints made of titanium and artificial hip joints for aging bodies , which allow people to really use all their possibilities and to develop beyond the limits that their natural destiny has set them .
Not to mention social networking platforms .
People allow themselves to have their own identity , define themselves in their own way , and thus orient themselves globally to groups that they choose .
So maybe this technological shift makes it clearer .
Because ever before , there has always been a different truth , which is that every human being can give something very special to society and very powerful , and that human ability to adapt .
Our greatest plus is human ability to adapt .
This is an interesting story .
Because people keep asking me to tell me how to deal with adversity .
And I &apos;ll confess something to you : This sentence has .
Never fit for me , and I &apos;ve always been very uncomfortable .
Feeling with it .
Answering people &apos;s questions about it .
And I think gradually I understand .
Why ?
This sentence about dealing with adversity lives on the idea that success or happiness depends on it .
Tackling a challenge .
Without being shaped by the experience that it entails , as if my life had been so successful .
Because I could avoid the possible traps of a life with a prosthesis .
Or anyway , people perceive me with my disability .
But the truth is that we are changing .
Of course , we are shaped by the challenge .
Whether it &apos;s physical , emotional or even both .
And I claim that &apos;s good .
Adversity is not an obstacle that we need to curve to make our lives clearer .
Adversity is just part of our lives .
And I tend to see adversity as my shadow .
Sometimes I realize it &apos;s very present .
Sometimes it &apos;s hard to see .
But it &apos;s always with me .
And I don &apos;t want to reduce the impact or severity of a human struggle .
There are adversaries and challenges in life , and they &apos;re all too real .
And each person is different with them .
But the question is not whether we can get clear with adversity or not , but how we get clear with it .
So we &apos;re not just responsible for that .
We &apos;re also responsible for keeping the people we love from blows of fate , but preparing them for it .
All right .
So let &apos;s get it clear .
And we &apos;re not doing our kids a favor .
If we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
You have to separate two things clearly .
One is the medical fact that they &apos;re amputee , and the other is that they &apos;re amputee .
The social opinion about whether I &apos;m disabled or not .
And to be honest , the only real and lasting disability that I had to deal with is that the world is constantly saying .
It can describe me with these definitions .
In our desire to protect the people that care about us and tell them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis , or even a prognosis of the quality of life that they need to expect .
We need to be careful not to lay the foundation for someone actually being disabled .
Maybe the current concept is just that .
What &apos;s broken in a broken , and how we fix it , for each individual , a greater disability than pathology itself .
If we don &apos;t treat a person holistically and don &apos;t perceive all of his forces and possibilities .
And we recognize , in addition to the natural struggle that you may need to fight .
Another disease .
We degrade a person who has value for our society .
So we need to look beyond patology and focus on all areas of human possibilities .
Most importantly , there is a connection between perception of our shortcomings and our great inventive spirit .
We should not devalue or deny these challenging times .
We should not try to avoid them .
Nor should we sweep them under the carpet , but it &apos;s possible .
It &apos;s about recognizing opportunities in adversity .
It &apos;s perhaps more about making it clear to me that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome adversity , but that we are open to embracing it , to embrace it , to use a campaign expression .
And maybe even dance with it .
And maybe we can see adversity as something natural , coherent and useful , and feel so burdened by its presence .
This year we celebrate Charles Darwin &apos;s 200th birthday .
And when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , Darwin pointed out something very true in human nature in my eyes .
I would describe it like this : &quot; Not the strongest of its kind survives . &quot;
And not the smartest of its kind , but the one that can best adapt to change .
Conflict creates creativity , not just from Darwin &apos;s work .
Do we know that human ability to survive and flourish from the struggle of the human mind ?
It &apos;s determined to change through conflict .
So again , change and adaptation are the greatest abilities of man .
And maybe we know only from which wood .
We &apos;re carved when we &apos;re really tested .
Maybe that &apos;s the meaning of adversity .
A perception of ego .
A feeling of our own strength .
We can give ourselves something like that .
We can give adversity a new meaning that goes beyond difficult times .
Maybe we can see adversity as change .
Adversity is a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to yet .
I think the greatest damage we &apos;ve done to ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
Let &apos;s be honest .
Who &apos;s normal ?
There &apos;s no normal .
There &apos;s the usual , the typical , but not the normal , and would you be this poor , gray person ?
Really , you know .
You want to learn .
If you really existed , I don &apos;t think so .
It would be great if we could actually change this pattern of normality against another of the possibilities or the strength to put it a little bit more dangerous .
So we can unleash the forces of very many children .
And invite them to bring their very special and valuable skills into society .
Anthropolgen has found that we humans , of the members of our society , have always demanded one thing : To be useful and to contribute .
There are indications that even the Neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , had worn older people and people with severe physical injuries .
And that might have happened because the life experience in these people &apos;s struggle for survival was valuable to society .
They didn &apos;t break these people as broken and useless .
They were seen as something special .
And valuable .
A few years ago , I went to a food market in the city where I grew up .
In that red zone in the northeast of Pennsylvania , and I stood in front of a cup of tomatoes .
It was summer .
And I had shorts .
And I hear a guy say behind me .
Well , if that &apos;s not Aimee Mullins , and I turn around and see this older man .
I had no idea who he is .
And I said , &quot; Excuse me .
Sir , do we know ? &quot;
I can &apos;t get to .
You remember .
And he said , &quot; Well , yeah . &quot;
You &apos;re unlikely to get to grips with that .
I remember when I first saw them , I took them out of their mother &apos;s belly .
Oh , so he did , and of course it did , but click .
That was Dr. Kean .
A man I knew only from my mother &apos;s stories about that day .
Because , of course , I came two weeks late on my birthday , typical .
My mother &apos;s doctor for prenatal diagnostics was on vacation .
And so my parents didn &apos;t know the man who gave me birth at all .
And because I was born without a calf &apos;s legs .
And my feet had turned towards them .
And I just had a few toes .
On this one and a few toes on the other foot , he was the handler , this stranger had to .
The bad news has to pass .
He said to me , &quot; I had to tell your parents that you would never walk and never be so mobile .
Would you be like other kids , or you could never live an independent life ? &quot;
And since then , they &apos;ve just lied to me .
They &apos;ve punished me .
Really ?
Exceptionally , I found that he &apos;s collected newspaper clips of my entire childhood .
Whether I won a letter contest in second grade .
Whether I was traveling with the scouts on Halloween parade , whether I had won my scholarship or one of my sporting victories .
And he used these clips to teach his students .
Medical students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School .
And he called this part of his course &quot; The X Factor : The Potential of Human Will . &quot;
You just can &apos;t stress enough how critical this factor can be for a human being &apos;s quality of life .
And Dr. Kean went on to tell us .
He said , &quot; I learned that if you don &apos;t get something else constantly , and even if you get a little bit of support , children get a little bit of support .
If you leave kids to themselves , children can achieve a lot .
Look .
Dr. Kean has changed his thinking .
He understood that medical diagnosis and how someone deals with it .
Two different things are , and so are two different things .
I &apos;ve changed my thinking over time .
If you asked me at the age of 15 , would I have changed my prostheses against legs made of meat and bones ?
Then I wouldn &apos;t have hesitated for a second .
I really wanted to be normal at the time .
If you ask me that today , I &apos;m not so sure .
And that &apos;s what happened because I &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , not despite those experiences .
And maybe that change could happen because I &apos;ve met so many people who have opened doors to me .
Instead of meeting people who want to restrict me or overtake me with an idea .
See ?
It really only takes a person to demonstrate to you .
How you can manifest your forces , and you &apos;re through .
If you allow someone to activate their own inner forces .
The human mind is so receptive .
If you can do that and open a door to someone at a critical moment .
Then you &apos;re a very good teacher for these people .
You teach them to open doors to themselves .
The real meaning of the word .
Educate is rooted in the word educe .
It means to create something that is in one that tickles out the potential .
Again , what potential do we want ?
Well , in the &apos; 60s , a case study was done in the United Kingdom .
Back then , high schools were transformed into schools .
They call this streaming trials .
In the United States , we call this tracking , and students are divided into grades .
And the A students are being tested orally harder .
The better teachers , etc . , they have students with a sufficient period of three months .
They gave the grade very well .
They were told .
They were Aces that they were very smart .
And after those three months , they really wrote one .
And of course , it breaks you down .
Hearing the heart that the other way around , the one @-@ serer students were told .
They were just enough .
And so did the three months after .
But only those who were still in school , apart from the students who had run out of school .
And the key thing about this study was that the teachers were not inaugurated .
The teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
They were just told that they were the ones , and that the students with the grade are sufficient .
And they were taught something like that .
And they treated the only real disability is a broken mind .
A spirit that was broken has no hope anymore .
It &apos;s not beautiful anymore .
It lacks our natural , childish curiosity and our innate ability to imagination .
But if we can help the human mind to continue to hope , to hope , to self and other people around it .
To find beautiful , to be curious and imaginative .
Then we really use our forces positively .
If a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new forms of existence .
I want to end with a poem written by a Persian poet named Hafiz in the 14th century .
And the poem that my friend Jacques Dembois told me about , and the poem is called &quot; The God Who Knows Only Four Words . &quot;
Every child doesn &apos;t know God , the God .
The name , not the God .
The prohibition , but the God Who Knows Only Four Words .
And this is repeated all the time .
He only always says , &quot; Come dance with me . &quot;
&quot; Come dance with me . &quot;
Thank you very much .
