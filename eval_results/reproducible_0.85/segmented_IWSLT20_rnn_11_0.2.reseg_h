A few years ago here at TED , Peter Skillman launched a design competition called &quot; The Marshmallow Challenge . 
&quot; The idea is pretty simple . Four teams have to have the widest possible freestanding structure with 20 spaghetti , about 1m tape , about 1m thread . And a marshmallow building , 
the marshmallow has to get up on top . 
Be up there , and though it really seems simple , it &apos;s actually true . Hard , because it &apos;s pushing people to work together very quickly . 
And so I thought this was a really interesting idea . And I did it into a design workshop . 
It was a huge success . 
Since then , I &apos;ve been holding about 70 workshops around the world . With students , developers and architects , even CTOs , Fortune 50 companies , and there &apos;s something to do with this . What deep impressions into nature . Working together allows , and I want to share some of these with you . 
Normally , most people start themselves , right ? With regard to the task of orienting , 
they talk about it , they think about what it looks like . Will it hang around to power , 
then they invest in it . A little time . In planning and organization , they sketch and put spaghetti out , 
they invest a lot of their time . In assembling , constantly growing structures 
and eventually , just before they don &apos;t have time anymore . Does anybody take the marshmallow ? And they put it gently . On top of it , step one step . Back and admire TA @-@ da . You admire your work . 
But then , almost always , what happens is that TA @-@ da becomes an UH @-@ Oh . Because weight of the marshmallow causes the marshmallow to do the whole thing to bend and collapse , 
there &apos;s a series of people who have a lot more UH @-@ Oh moments . As others , and among the worst , are freshly @-@ educated BWL graduates , 
they lie , they cheat . They &apos;re confused . And they really produce . Droughty entities . 
And of course , there are teams . They have much more TA @-@ DA formations , and among the best ones . Fresh graduates of the kindergarten , 
and that &apos;s quite amazing . 
How Peter told us , they don &apos;t just produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting ones . Structures of all , 
what you might ask . Is it like , &quot; Is it coming ? &quot; Why ? What about those 
and Peter ? Does not one of the kids tell us , &quot; Time is investing in it , &quot; CEO of Spaghetti GmbH . Being them invest ? 
They don &apos;t invest time . In power struggles . 
There &apos;s another one , 
and that &apos;s that BWL students were trained . Some of them have a real plan to find . 
OK . And then to realize what then happens 
, what happens ? If you want to get the Marshmallow on top , you don &apos;t have time anymore , and what happens ? 
It &apos;s a crisis . 
Sounds familiar . What kindergarten 
kids do differently ? Make it is they &apos;re connected to the Marshmallow . And prototypes build successful prototypes . Always with the Marshmallow at the top . So they &apos;re doing multiple opportunities to get dilapidated prototypes to repair . 
Constructors recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of an iterative process . 
And with every attempt , the kids get immediately . Feedback : What works ? And what doesn &apos;t . 
So this is performance with prototypes . Working to a lot , but let &apos;s see how different . Teams act 
, the average for most is , at about 50 centimeters , BWL students . Do half of them do . Lawyers do something about that . More , but not . A lot of kindergarten kids . Are better . Than adults . 
Who is most successful ? 
Architects and engineers . 
Fortunately , 1m , the highest level I &apos;ve seen . 
And why ? Because they understand triangles . And self @-@ reinforcing geometric patterns . Are the keys ? To have stable structures , 
CEOs are a little above average . But here it gets interesting . 
If you put an executive administrator on the team , they become significantly better . 
It &apos;s incredible . You can see around and see this team . Will you win ? You 
can predict . Why ? Is that possible ? 
Because you have special process monitoring skills . 
You run the process . You understand it , 
and that team that regulates it , and you pay attention to the work , the team &apos;s performance will significantly improve . 
Specialized skills and process skills and their combination will lead to success . 
If you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six , the stable structures have . 
I tried something exciting now . 
I thought , let &apos;s bring the poker bet in the same way . 
So I offered a $ 10,000 prize . I offered software for the winners . 
What do you think happened ? With these design students , 
what was that ? 
Result : This didn &apos;t happen . A team had a stable structure . 
If anyone had a two @-@ inch construction built , he would have won the prize home . 
Is it not interesting ? That high betting bets have a strong effect , 
we repeated this exercise with the same students . 
What do you think happened ? 
Well , you understood the advantage . The prototyping , 
it turned out to be the same bad team . One of the best ones , 
they produced the highest construction in the least time . 
There &apos;s a profound lesson for us . There &apos;s a profound lesson about the nature of propulsion and success . 
You like to ask . Why ? Would anyone actually invest time ? A Marshmallow Challenge to 
create . The reason is , I help create digital tools . And make processes to create teams to help . Cars , video games and visual games . 
Effects to create . And what the Marshmallow Challenge does is it helps you create hidden assumptions , and it helps you identify them . 
Because frankly , every project has its own Marshmallow , the challenge that it offers 
. A shared experience , a shared language or attitude , the right prototype to 
build . And this is the value of this experience . This so simple exercise 
and those of you who have an interest in it can be : Marshmallowchallenge @ com. Visit 
it &apos;s a blog where you can see . How to get the Marshmallows built . 
There &apos;s a step @-@ by @-@ step guide there . 
You can find crazy examples . Around the world , like people optimize the system and 
refiner it , there are also world records , 
and the basal lesson , I think . Is the construction ? In fact , a connecting sport . Is 
it required ? Is it that we all put our senses on the task , and that we optimally target our thinking ? How do we use our emotions and our actions in the challenge that lies ahead of us ? 
And sometimes , a small prototype . This experience , everything it takes . We are told from an UH @-@ Oh to a TA @-@ DA moment . Bring it , 
and this can make a big difference . 
Thank you very much . 
Let &apos;s pretend we have here to have a machine . 
A big machine . A cool TED @-@ like one . Machine , and this is a time machine . 
And everybody in this room has to enter in , 
and you can go back to the past , you can go into the future . You can &apos;t go into the here 
and now . And I wonder what you &apos;re choosing . Would you , because I &apos;ve been asking my friends this question a lot recently , and they all wanted to go into the past ? 
I don &apos;t know they wanted to go back to time before cars were there . Or Twitter or America . Suck the superstar . 
I don &apos;t know . 
I &apos;m convinced you somehow get to nostalgia for wishful thinking , to wishful thinking . 
And that &apos;s what I understand . 
I &apos;m not part of this group . Do I have to say , &quot; 
I don &apos;t want to go into the past , &quot; and that &apos;s not because I &apos;m an adventurer . 
It &apos;s because opportunities on this group are not back on the planet . They &apos;re going forward , 
so I want to go into this machine , and I want to go into the future . 
This is the greatest time . It &apos;s ever been on this planet , no matter what scale they &apos;re going to take . Health , wealth . Mobility , opportunities , declining . Disease rates . 
There has never been a time like this before . 
My great grandparents died . Everybody when they were 60 , 
my grandparents , pushed this number to 70 , 
my parents . Are the 80 ? On the heels . 
There should be better a nine on the beginning of my death . 
But it &apos;s not even about people . How do we ? Because this is a bigger thing . Than that 
a child who &apos;s in New Delhi today can be born . Expect so long to live . Like the richest man on earth . 100 years ago , 100 years ago , they thought . They 
think about it . This is an incredible fact . 
And why is this ? Smallpox , 
smallpox , smallpox , has billions of people killed on this planet . 
They &apos;ve got demographics of the Earth . They &apos;ve been redesigned in a way that no war ever managed to do . 
They &apos;re gone . They &apos;ve disappeared . 
We &apos;ve defeated them . Puff 
in the rich world . Do diseases exist ? The millions of us , just one generation ago , who have threatened . Hardly any 
diphtheria is rubbing polio . 
Does it know at all ? Anyone else ? 
What that is ? Vaccines . Modern medicine . Our ability to reach out to billions of people to feed . These are successes . The scientific method 
and from my point of view , the scientific method is things . Try it out , see if it works . It changes when it doesn &apos;t . One of the greatest achievements of humanity , 
so this is the good news . 
Unfortunately , this is the whole good news . Because there &apos;s a few other problems . And they &apos;ve been mentioned many times . 
And one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people in the world every day . 
Hungry to bed . Go to bed , this number rises , and it rises very quickly . And that &apos;s embarrassing . 
And not only that . We have our imagination used to do that . This world 
to devastate thoroughly : Drinking water , primal land , rainforests . Oil , gas , they disappear . And soon . And if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos , we also disappear the question . 
So , can we do that ? I think I think it &apos;s , 
I think , clear that we produce food . Can the billions of people feed ? Will it be without the land where they live ? Rape me . 
I think we can rape this world with energy . They can &apos;t destroy it at the same time . 
I really think so . And no . That &apos;s not wishful thinking . 
But this is holding me awake at night . One of the things that awakes me at night is we have scientific progress never before , so much needed . Now , how do we do it ? Never before . 
And we &apos;ve also never been to the point where we could make it reasonable . So we used to use it as we can today . 
We &apos;re at the threshold of amazing , amazing events on many fronts and yet , I think , really , we &apos;re hundreds of 300 years before the Enlightenment , going back . Would we have to go back to find a time ? In the process of fighting progress , in which we talked about these things more vigorously , we had to fight progress . More fronts than we now have , 
people are wrapping themselves in their faith , and that &apos;s so narrow . That you don &apos;t liberate them . 
Can &apos;t even tell the truth . You liberate and hear them . 
Everybody has a right . They have a right to their opinion , even a right . They have a right to their opinion on progress , 
but you know what they don &apos;t have a right to . 
They don &apos;t have a right to their own facts . You have no right to blame , 
and I took a while . To figure out that out 
about a decade ago , I published an article about immunization for The New Yorker . A little article , 
and I was amazed at resistance . I was struck by resistance to what was ultimately what was the most effective healthcare measure in the history of humanity in the world . 
Is it not me who knew what I was doing ? So if I was to do something , I was just doing what I was always doing . I wrote an article and I went on . 
And soon afterwards , I wrote an article about genetically modified . Food : The 
same thing . Only bigger 
people played crazy . 
So I also had a paper about it , and I could not understand . Why ? People thought that was frankenfood . Why ? They believed molecules were on a certain molecule , rather than a random way of moving around , an attack on the territory of nature . 
But was it , you know , I do what I do ? I wrote the article . I kept going . 
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist . We type , 
we type , we reach , we go food . That &apos;s okay . 
But these articles made me worry . And I couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually found . I found it out . 
And that &apos;s because these fanatics are the fanatics that made me crazy . Anyway , no fanatics . 
Was that prudent people ? Educated people , decent people , 
they were just like the people in this room . 
And that got me so confused . 
But then I thought , &quot; You know what ? Let &apos;s be honest . 
We &apos;re on a point . We &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress . As we used to talk . 
Intermediate about that . 
We talk ironically about it . &quot; With small quotes , &quot; That &apos;s why progress is . Okay 
, there are reasons for that . And I think we know what reasons that are . 
We have confidence in institutions , in authority and sometimes in institutions , in science . In itself , we have lost , and there is no reason why that shouldn &apos;t be like that . 
You can just do a few names . And people will understand 
Chernobyl . Bhopal , Challenger , Vioxx , weapons of mass destruction , the 2000 US presidential election , I mean , 
you know , you can choose your own list . 
There are questions and problems . With people from whom we believed we had them always right , they always have . Be , therefore , skeptical . 
Ask questions , demand . You demand evidence . 
You take evidence . You take nothing but given . 
Go , but now it &apos;s when you have evidence , you have to accept that evidence . And in that , we &apos;re not good at . And I 
can do that for the reason . That we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear , like me , which I &apos;ve never seen before . And hopefully never again will see before 
about 12 years ago , it was . A story was published . A terrible story . Those who have been able to cope with the autism epidemic with measles , mumps and rubells , vaccines . 
Very scary . 
Haufenwise studies were done . To see if this was true , 
Haufenwise studies were to be done . This is a serious matter . 
The data came in . 
The data came in . The data came in from the United States , from England , from Sweden , from Canada , and they were all the same . No correlation , no connection . No , no , it . 
Don &apos;t make any difference . It doesn &apos;t make any difference . Because we &apos;re believing in anecdotes , we believe what we see . What we see , believe what causes us to become real , feel real . 
We don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents . From a government clerk who gives us data , and I understand that . I think that &apos;s what we all do . 
But you know what ? 
The result of that was catastrophic . 
Catastrophic because of this fact . The United States is one of the only countries in the world . In which the vaccination rate for measles is falling , this 
is scandalous , and we should be ashamed . 
It &apos;s terrible . 
What happened ? That we do that . 
Well , I understand that . That &apos;s what I do . Because here 
&apos;s somebody who has measles . Has 
a single one in the audience ? The somebody who dies of measles happens 
not very often . 
Happens in this country . Not at all . But 160,000 times on the planet . Last year , 
these are many deaths caused by measles . 20 per hour , 
but because that &apos;s not happening here . Can we do it out of place ? And people like Jenny McCarthy can . Walk around . And messages of fear . And illiteracy of platforms like Oprah and Larry King live preach preaching 
and that can be done by you . Because they cause and correlation not to connect . 
You don &apos;t understand that these things are equal to being the same . But almost never the same , 
and that &apos;s something that &apos;s something that we learn . We need to learn very quickly , and 
this guy was a hero of Jonas Salk , and 
he liberated us from one of the worst scourges of humanity . Don &apos;t be afraid . 
Don &apos;t be agonized . Cheese . Puff . Gone . 
The guy in the middle , not so much . 
He &apos;s called Paul Offit . 
He &apos;s just got a few other people with a Rotavirus vaccine . 
He can live the lives of 400 , 500,000 children a year in the developing world . Save 
pretty well . Not , 
well , that &apos;s good . Apart from Paul walking around and talking about vaccines and saying , &quot; How valuable they are . &quot; And that people just stop . 
Should they complain ? And that &apos;s what 
he says , actually , so Paul is a terrorist , 
so if Paul is speaking at a public hearing , he can &apos;t do without armed guards . If 
he says he gets calls . At home . Because people tell him they like to . They know where his children are going to school , 
and why ? Because Paul has a vaccine made . 
I need not . I need not say , but vaccines are essential . If 
you take them away . Turn the diseases back . Back . Terrible diseases . And that &apos;s what happens . 
We have just , in this country , measles now , 
and that &apos;s getting worse . And pretty soon , kids will get to die of it again . Because that &apos;s just a question . The numbers 
and they won &apos;t just be on measles . 
What about polio ? Let &apos;s take that . Why ? 
Not . A fellow militant . Of me , I was told a few weeks ago , and I said , &quot; She believes I &apos;m a little too shrill . 
Nobody has ever had said that before . 
&quot; She would tell her child not to vaccinate against polio . She would never . 
Fine , 
why ? Because we don &apos;t have polio . And you know what ? 
We had in this country yesterday , no polio . 
Today , I don &apos;t know . Maybe this morning somebody went up in Lagos . In an airplane , and he &apos;s flying . Go ahead . Angeles . Right now , he &apos;s over Ohio . 
And into a few hours , he lands and rents . A car , and he comes to Long . Beach , and he becomes one of these fantastic TED dinners . 
This evening , he &apos;s not sure he &apos;s going to be with a paralyzing disease , And we know that . Not because that &apos;s how the world works . Well , 
that &apos;s the planet . On which we live , they don &apos;t . Pretend to be the way it isn &apos;t . 
We love it . We love lying in lies . We love it . 
Do you have everybody this morning your vitamins ? Take 
Echinacea . A little antioxidant , that &apos;s what it does . Just put them on the jumps . Does it help me ? 
I know . You know you did that . Because half of Americans , that &apos;s what they do every day . 
They take that stuff . And they take alternative remedies . And it doesn &apos;t make any difference . How often we find out that they &apos;re useless ? 
The data shows this all the time . 
They evaporate their urine . More do they do . Nearly never . 
This is okay . You want 28 billion dollars . For dark urine , pay . 
I agree with you completely . 
Dark urine , dark . 
Why ? Let &apos;s do that . Why ? Let &apos;s do that . 
Well , I think we understand . Hate the pharmaceutical industry . 
We hate one too strong government . We don &apos;t have confidence . We have faith in the system , 
and we shouldn &apos;t . Our healthcare system is . Mies , 
it &apos;s cruel . Millions of people , 
it &apos;s absolute amazing . Cold and soulful , even . To us who are afford it , 
we walk , so we &apos;re off and where are we going . We run , 
we walk into the arms of the placebo industry . 
That &apos;s great . I love the placebo industry . 
But you know that ? Is really a serious matter . Because that stuff is crap . And we give billions of dollars for it . Exit , 
and I have all sorts of little props here , no . 
Of them , Gingko was cheating . Echinacea was cheating . Acai : I don &apos;t know . Let &apos;s see what that is . But we give billions of dollars for it . It &apos;s cheating , 
and you know what ? If I say that , I &apos;m being screamed at by people . And they say , &quot; What cares ? &quot; &quot; Let people , let &apos;s do it . &quot; &quot; What they 
want , &quot; they feel good . And 
you know what ? They &apos;re wrong . 
Because it doesn &apos;t matter to me . Whether it &apos;s the Health Minister who says , &quot; Hmm , I &apos;m going to get the evidence from my experts on mammography . &quot; Or some cancer quack limb that can inject coffee into his patients if they &apos;re looking 
at this path . Where do I think and magic , replace evidence and science , they get to a place where they &apos;re not going to be . 
They get to Thabo . Mbeki in South Africa : 
He brought 400,000 of his people around because he insisted that he insisted that red beds , garlic and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs . Of those we know they &apos;re the course of AIDS @-@ inhibiting , you know . 
Hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country worse than any other of these diseases plagued . 
Will you tell me , please don &apos;t you tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences ? 
They have them . They always have them . 
Well , the most brain @-@ free epidemic . In which we &apos;re in the moment , this absurd battle between the proponents of genetically modified organisms is . Changed food and the bio @-@ elite . 
This is an idiotic one . Debate : It has to stop . 
It &apos;s a debate about words about metaphors , 
this is ideology . Not science . 
Everything we eat , every grain of rice , every branch of parsley , every sprouts . Was made by people ? 
You know , there were no mandarin . In paradise , 
there were no cantaloupe melons . There were no Christmas trees . We have all done this . 
We have it in the last 11 000 years . 
And some of it worked . And some of it didn &apos;t . 
We got rid of it . What not ? It worked . 
Now we can do it more precisely . And of course , there are risks . But we can do something like vitamin A in rice . And the stuff can be helpful to millions of people . Millions of people , their lives . 
Extending the life . That &apos;s what they want . Don &apos;t do it . 
I have to say , I understand that . Not 
we reject genetically . Modified food . 
Why ? Let &apos;s do that . 
Well , what I hear all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides . Hormones . Mono @-@ culture . We don &apos;t want huge fields . With one thing , that &apos;s wrong . 
We don &apos;t want companies to patent lives , 
we don &apos;t want companies to own seeds . 
And you know what ? My answer to all of this is , 
yes , you &apos;re right . Let &apos;s fix that . 
It &apos;s true . We have a huge food problem . But that &apos;s not science . 
That &apos;s science . It &apos;s not science . 
It &apos;s right . Morality , patent crab . 
You know that science is not a company . 
It &apos;s not a country . 
It &apos;s not even an idea . It &apos;s a process . 
It &apos;s a process . And sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t . But the idea that we can give science no permission to do their work . Because we &apos;re afraid . Is it a real impasse ? And it keeps millions of people from flourishing . 
You know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to get 70 percent more food . Do we have to grow 70 percent more food than we currently have 70 percent of 
this investment in Africa over the last 30 years ? 
Shameful , shameful . 
You need that , and we give it to you . Not , 
and why ? Genetically . Modified food . 
We want people not to encourage this rotten stuff . To eat like , for example , 
maniok @ maniok is something that &apos;s half a billion people eat . 
It &apos;s about like a potato . 
It &apos;s just a bunch of calories . It &apos;s bad . 
It doesn &apos;t have nutrients . It doesn &apos;t have protein . And scientists are building all this right now . In it , 
and then people could do the food . And wouldn &apos;t be blind . Are 
they not going to starve ? And you know what ? 
That would be nice . It wouldn &apos;t be Chez . Panisse , but it would be beautiful , 
and everything I say about it is , why are we fighting this ? 
I mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why ? Let &apos;s fight this 
. Because we don &apos;t want to push genes around . 
It &apos;s not about pushing genes around . It &apos;s not about chemicals . 
It &apos;s not about our ridiculous ones . Passion for hormones . Our insistence on greater food . Better food . A unique food . 
It &apos;s not about rice . Krispies : It &apos;s about keeping people alive . And it &apos;s high time to understand . What that means , 
because you know what 
if we don &apos;t do that ? If we keep on going as we do before , we start doing it . Something guilty of it . We believe that we don &apos;t . We want to be guilty of high @-@ tech colonialism . 
There &apos;s no other description . For what &apos;s happening here , 
it &apos;s selfish . It &apos;s ugly . It &apos;s not worthy of us . And we have to really stop that . 
After this incredibly fun conversation , you want to say , maybe you always want to be into this ridiculous one . Time machine and the future , going 
to be definitely . That &apos;s what I want anyway . Right now , 
it &apos;s in the present . But we have an incredible opportunity . 
We can have this time machine put on everything . What we want . 
We can move it . Where we move it . Want , and we will . Move where we want . 
We need to have these conversations . And we need to think . But if we go into the time machine and into the future , we will . We will be glad . We did . We have . 
I know we have . And as far as I am concerned , this is something that the world needs now . 
Thank you . 
Thank you . When Steve Lopez , a columnist of the Los Angeles Times , one day , walked through the streets in the center of Los Angeles . Did he hear wonderful music ? 
She came from a man , an African @-@ American , sympathetic . Rough homeless , who is playing on a violin . Who &apos;s only two strings left 
, many of them will be the story . Because from Steve &apos;s article about this , a book later became a book that was filmed again . Robert Downey , Junior , when Steve Lopez and Jamie Foxx , when Nathaniel Anthony , Ayers , the contrabass player who studied at the Juilliard Conservatory , and whose promising career tragically early on through his paranoid career . Schizophrenia was ended . 
Nathaniel left Juilliard , suffered a nervous breakdown , and 30 years later , he lived as homeless on the streets of Skid Row . In the center of Los Angeles , 
I recommend to you all Steve &apos;s book . Read or read the movie . Look at it so that you can not only understand the wonderful connection . The links between these two men that have emerged , but also how the music creates that connection . Helped and how they eventually made the instrument when this play of words is allowed , which is half . Nathaniel , away from the street , getting away . 
I met Mr. Ayers in 2008 . Two years ago , in the Walt Disney Concert Hall , 
he just had a demonstration . Of Beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , heard and came behind the stage to get me to imagine . 
He spoke in a very cheerful and sociable tone . About yo @-@ yo , ma and Hillary Clinton and about how the Dodgers never put it into baseball world . Series : And that &apos;s all because of the insidious passage . The first violin in the last sentence of Beethoven &apos;s Fourth Symphony : 
&quot; We got to the topic . &quot; ( Music to speak and a few days later , I got an email in which I was saying , &quot; ... That Nathaniel was in favour of violin lessons with me . 
&quot; I have to mention that Nathaniel was opposed to medical treatment , because he was already in electroshocks and with Thorazin . And handcuffs were treated . Trauma that caused him all his life to 
persecute him as a result of that is now particularly vulnerable . For these schizophrenic phases , which are sometimes so bad that they can make him tear up . And he disappears for days . In the streets of Skid Row , he &apos;s always wandering around this horror . And torture torment of his own mind , and in exactly 
the same stage of excitement , Nathaniel was when we were with our first lesson in our Walt Disney Concert at Hall . He started . He had this crazy flicker in his eyes . And he was totally lost . 
He talked about invisible . Demons and smoke and about how he was being asleep poisoned by someone . 
Did I want to be scared ? Not for me , but for me , I was scared . That I was losing him . Could he be put in one of his states ? And that I was going to tell him to break his relationship with the violin . Could I , when I started talking about clay ladders and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic ? Violin pedagogy . 
I started just talking , so I started . 
Play , I played the first sentence of Beethoven . Violin Concerto , 
and as I played , I noticed that in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes , a complete change was taking place . 
It was as if he was going to be under the influence of an invisible doctor . A chemical reaction , whose catalyst was my game , was Nathaniel &apos;s maniac 
anger turned . It turned into understanding , into a calm curiosity and grace , 
and like a miracle , he took his violin . And he began to listen . Some excerpts of violin concerts to play . And he then asked me to finish them . To play Mendelssohn , Tchaikovsky , Sibelius . 
And we started to play about music . To talk about , starting with Bach . To talk about Beethoven , Brahms , Bruckner and all the other BS of Bartók . To go to ESA @-@ Pekka , Salonen , 
and I realized that he wasn &apos;t just an encyclopedic knowledge of music . He was with her , too , a close personal relationship . 
He was talking about her . He was talking about her with a passion and an understanding that I would otherwise only be able to share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic . 
Knowing by making music . And about music , was from this paranoid , confused man . He was just being thrown through the streets of Los Angeles , right ? A lovely , educated man . Excellent at Juilliard . Trained musician . 
Was become ( Music ) Is medicine ? ( Music changed ) 
We changed for Nathaniel means music . Eligible health , 
because music allows it to give it its thoughts and delusions with the help of imagination and creativity . In something real 
, to transform and thus escapes its agonizing . 
Status : I understood that this is the very essence of art . 
This is exactly why this is why we make music . So that we can do something that is deep inside of us all . Our feelings through our artistic lens , through our creativity , to reality . Forms can form 
and the reality of that expression . Achieving us all . And moves inspired . And unites us what 
Nathaniel was about . So he was brought by music . Back to a community . Friends who were 
the redeeming force of music brought him back . Towards a family of musicians who brought him to understand the talent that he knew . And he respected , 
and I &apos;m going to go on playing with Nathaniel . Whether in the Walt Disney Concert , Hall or in Skid , Row , because he reminds me of why I was a musician , 
Thank you very much . 
Bruno Giussani : Thank you very much . Thank you . 
Robert Gupta , 
Robert Gupta : I want to play something . The one I shamefully stolen from the cellist . 
Have I hope you forgive me , 
I &apos;m Jane McGonigal , I design computer games , 
I develop . Now , for 10 years . Online games and my goal for the next decade . Is it just as easy to make ? The world where reality is saving the world . How you can save in online games is 
, I have a plan for that . I want more people to convince . Including all of you , more time playing with bigger and more amazing . 
Games to spend now , we spend 3 billion hours a week . With online games , 
some of you may think , &quot; This is a lot . Time for games , 
maybe too much . &quot; Time , considering how many problems do we urgently have in the real world , to 
solve ? Do we actually have my research at the Institute for the Future , but that &apos;s exactly the opposite ? Right ? 
Three billion hours a week . Are not nearly enough ? To address the most pressing problems 
in the world , actually , I am convinced that if we &apos;re going to move to the next century , on this planet , we &apos;re going to have this time drastically . We need to increase that time . 
I &apos;ve calculated . That the time needed is 21 billion hours of playing time per week 
, that seems to be something wrong at first . So I repeat , so it works , if we can have problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity . If I want to do that , I think we need to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours per week by the end of the next decade . 
No . I mean , it &apos;s really . 
Ernst . Why ? 
This picture pretty accurately describes why . I think games are so vital to the survival of human beings . Are they 
serious ? This is a portrait of the photographer . Phil Toledano . 
He wanted to share the feelings of playing . So he &apos;s in front of the players , he &apos;s built a camera . 
This is one of the classic expressions of playing . 
If you &apos;re not a player , you may miss some of the nuances in this picture . 
You probably see this sense of urgency . Something scared . But also extreme concentration , deepened . In solving a real difficult problem , 
if you &apos;re playing , too . Look at some nuances . Here &apos;s the upward . Eyes drawn . And the mouth is a sign of optimism . The eyebrows show surprise . 
This is a player who &apos;s on the edge of what &apos;s called an epic victory . 
Oh , you know that ? 
OK . Great . So we have some players here , 
an epic victory is . One result that &apos;s so extremely positive that it &apos;s been so unsuccessful that you didn &apos;t even know that it was possible at all . 
It was almost beyond imagination . And if you can do it , you &apos;re shocked that you actually have to be able to do 
that . That &apos;s an epical victory . 
This player is about to be an epic . 
Victory , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to see on millions of faces of problem solvers around the world . Must we have to face the next century &apos;s hurdles when we tackle the face of those who face the odds of all odds on the edge of an epic ? Victory 
? Well , unfortunately , look . We rather see this face . In real life , when we face difficult problems , 
I call it the &quot; life in life &quot; . I mean , bad face . 
And it &apos;s actually my face . Look , yeah . OK . 
That &apos;s me . How I do that in life . I do bad face . Do 
this . This is a graffiti . In my former home country in Berkeley , California , where I was studying in my Ph.D. thesis why we &apos;re better at playing . Than in real life , 
this is a problem . This is a problem that many players have . 
We think that in reality , we &apos;re not so good . As in games . And 
I don &apos;t mean just less successful . Although that &apos;s part of it , 
we &apos;re getting more in games . 
I mean , good in context . With motivation , something meaningful to do , inspired by collaboration with each other , 
when we &apos;re in a game world . I think that many of us , in our best version , are turning into our best version . Anytime , immediately , ready to help , persistent . The problem of solving it , trying to solve it as long as necessary , try it again after failure , 
and in reality , when we fail , when we encounter obstacles . We often feel different . We feel overwhelmed . 
We feel defeated . We feel threatened . Maybe depressed . Frustrated , right ? Cynical , these feelings have . 
We never have when we play games in games , they exist . Not , 
and that &apos;s it . What I do as a PhD student want to study is , 
why is it in games ? Impossible . Think about you couldn &apos;t just do everything . 
How can we make these feelings out of the games into reality ? 
So I looked at games like World of Warcraft . This is the ideal environment for solving problems in a community , 
and I noticed a few things : Epic victories . In online worlds , 
making it possible , first of all , if you &apos;re going to join one of these online games , especially in World of Warcraft . Are there a lot of different characters ? They &apos;re ready to give you a world saving . Mission and mission , immediately , 
but not . Just some mission , but a mission . The mission perfect for your current level in the game . 
Right ? So they can do that . 
They never get a task . They don &apos;t get to 
solve it . But always on the edge of their abilities , so they have to make an effort , 
but there &apos;s no unemployment . In World of Warcraft , you don &apos;t sit around . And you turn around , dams . There &apos;s always a very specific one . Something important . To do , and 
there are in a way . 
Employees , wherever they go . Hundreds of thousands of people working with them to get their epic mission done 
, we have that in real life . Not so easy . This feeling that if you have a fingertip , you have staff who are willing to do it in a way , 
and there are also ... There are these epic stories . These inspiring stories , why we &apos;re there . And what we do have to do is we get this whole positive thing . 
Feedback : You &apos;ve certainly got from level . High and 1 . Strength . Hear . Or 1 . Intelligence . 
This constant feedback . Are there not ? In real life , 
when I &apos;m leaving this stage , I don &apos;t . 1 . Speak and 1 . Crazy idea . 20 . Crazy . 
Idea . I get real life . 
This feedback , not so the problem of collaborative online worlds like World of Warcraft . Is it that satisfying ? Anytime on the edge of an epic victory . To stand by that we prefer to be in those playgrounds all the time , they 
&apos;re just better . Than the 
reality to date , everyone has the World of Warcraft players together . 5.93 million years with that spent the virtual problems of Azeroth &apos;s 
virtual problems solving . That &apos;s not necessarily something bad . 
It may sound bad . 
But to put it in context , let &apos;s look at it at 5.93 million years ago . Did our first primate ancestors start to walk 
upright ? The first upright primacy , 
so OK ? So if we talk about how much time we currently spend with games , right ? Does that make sense ? When do you spend time with regard to time on the scale of human development ? In mind what &apos;s extraordinary , 
but also appropriate . Because it turns out that we have to do this by doing this all the time playing . In fact , changing what we as humans do is change what 
we are able to do . We develop into a community . 
Thinking , heartfelt beings . That &apos;s the truth . 
That &apos;s what I believe you will look at once . The recent statistics by a Carnegie researcher , Mellon University , published . The average young person today in the middle of a country with a strong playing culture spends . 10,000 hours with online games , up to the age of 21 . 
So 10,000 hours is a very , very interesting number . From two reasons , 
first of all , for children . In the United States , 10,080 hours are the exact total time you spend in school , the exact total time you spend . From the fifth grade to the end of high school . If you never miss it , 
so we have a complete parallel education path here , where young people learn the same thing that it means . A good player to be like anything else , whatever you &apos;re in school learning . And maybe 
some of you have that new book from Malcolm , Gladwell , flying over . So you know his theory . Of success , the theory of success , the 10,000 @-@ hour @-@ long . 
It &apos;s based on the great . Research in cognitive science that if we do 10,000 hours with the laborious study of any one subject , up to the age of 21 . We will spend mastering . In that , 
we will be so good at whatever . To do as the most important people in the world , 
that is , what we have here . Is a complete generation ? Young people , who are master players , 
are the big question . So is what exactly are players ? Masterfully good . Because 
if we figure out that out , we would never have been able to know anything before . Human potential 
available , so many people have , we currently have in the world , the world that has at least an hour a day playing online , 
these are our master players , 500 million people . The exceptionally good at something , 
and in the next decade . Do we have another billion ? Players that are exceptionally good . In whatever way , 
if you &apos;re doing it not yet heard . Have 
the game industry developed ? Consoles , the energy . Save and on mobile networks . Instead of broadband Internet , so that players around the world , especially in India , China . Brazil playing online , you can expect . 
An additional billion players next decade are expected to play 
online , and we &apos;ve got a total of 1.5 billion players , 
so I started . So I started thinking about what it is , what we can master these games . So 
here are the four . There are things I found : First urgency optimism , 
OK . So imagine that , like extreme self @-@ motivation . 
Urgent optimism is desire . Immediately , to do something . A hurdle to overcome , along with faith that we have a well @-@ founded hope of success . 
Players always believe that a epic epic victory is possible . And that it &apos;s always worth it to try . And that &apos;s equal to players . 
Don &apos;t sit around . 
Players are masters in spiders . Poet social networks . 
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research . They show that we people like more after we start working with them . Even if they &apos;re defeating us badly , 
the reason for that is that it &apos;s a lot of trust . With somebody , a game to play , 
we trust somebody to have time with us , right ? That the rules are being respected , that we have the same goal . And by the end of the game , 
so playing together allows for growing ties , trust and mutual relationships as a result . 
And we build stronger social relationships . We build on 
happy productivity . Fantastic . 
You know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of Warcraft player is 22 hours a week . So as part @-@ time job , 
the reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier at it . Hard to work than when we &apos;re relaxing . Or nothing . Let &apos;s do it . 
We know that as human beings , we work optimally . When we do hard , significant work 
and players are always ready . Hard to work . When they do the right job and 
eventually get epic meaning , 
players love . It &apos;s part of awe @-@ inspiring . Missions of planetary proportions . 
To become here is a background information to get this right . You probably know all Wikipedia . The biggest Wiki in the world , the 
second largest Wiki . The world with almost 80,000 entries , Is the World of Warcraft ? Wiki 
: Five million people use it every month . 
They have more information . About World of Warcraft on the Internet , collected than about any other topic . In any other Wiki in the world , 
they create an epic . 
History : They create an epic . Source of knowledge about the World of Warcraft : 
OK . These are four superpowers . They become one single result : Players are super @-@ powerful , hopeful . 
Individuals : They are people who believe they are as individuals , the world can change . 
And the only problem is they can believe they can change the virtual worlds , they can change the virtual worlds . But not the real ones . 
That &apos;s the problem . The &quot; I &quot; try to solve is 
Edward Castronova . A scientist , 
his work . Is awesome 
? He &apos;s studying why . People have so much time . Energy and money . In online worlds , 
he says , &quot; We &apos;re witnessing not less than one mass emigration in virtual worlds . &quot; And online gaming environments , 
and this by an economist , so he &apos;s logical . 
And he doesn &apos;t say the way I develop , I play . I &apos;m a little exuberant . 
So he says , &quot; This actually makes sense . &quot; Because players can play more online worlds than they can in real life . 
They can play stronger social ties in games . When they do in real life , they get more feedback . And rewards in games than real @-@ life rewards , 
so he says , &quot; It &apos;s perfectly logical right now . &quot; That players have more time in virtual world than in virtual world than 
in real . I &apos;m just going to agree . I agree . 
That &apos;s logical . But it &apos;s definitely . No optimal situation . 
We have to start to build the real world into a game . 
My inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s 2,500 years back , and it &apos;s a game that I &apos;ve been inspired by . 
There are these ancient cubes of sheep &apos;s cocks , 
you know ? Before these fantastic game econtrollers , there were sheep &apos;s cocks , 
and these were , so to speak , the first people to develop . Play equipment , and if you &apos;re working with the works of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus , you might know this story . The story about how and why ? 
Play was invented according to Herodotus . Games , more precisely craps in the kingdom of Lydia during famine . 
Reportedly , there was such a big famine . That the king of lydia became a king of lydia , a crazy idea that 
people suffered , people fought . 
It was an extreme situation . It took an extreme solution . 
So they invented , according to Herodotus , the craps and agreed a national strategy . On one day you would eat . The next day you would play 
and they would play so much in the craps . Be deepened there . Games so fascinating . Are and are with us more satisfying ? Happy productivity . Surrounded by the fact that they would forget . That there &apos;s nothing to eat . 
And then the next day you would play and play , and the next day you would eat 
and according to herodotus survived . They survived 18 years of this famine . By thinking about a day and eating on the next day , just like that , I think . 
Let &apos;s play today , we put games in , we put games in , 
to respond to the suffering of the real world . We escape , we put games in , to escape everything . That in the real world doesn &apos;t work . Everything that works in real life . Not satisfying . Is and we get what we get , what we need . From the games , 
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end . 
That &apos;s the exciting thing 
, loud , herodotus . Was it 18 years after the famine not better ? So the king decided one last cube game to be played , 
they divided the kingdom into two halves . 
They played a cube game . And the winners were allowed to become an epic adventure . 
Break up , they left lydia and set out to search for . A new home , they just let so many people go back as they could survive food . And they were looking for the rest of the area where they thrive . 
Could that sound crazy ? 
Or , latest DNA evidence ? Show that the Etruscans who later became the Roman Empire , the same DNA as the Etruscans , the same DNA as the old Lydians . 
So , scientists recently came to the conclusion that herodotus , crazy story , is actually true . 
And geologists found evidence of global cooling . The nearly 20 years took , which was the explanation of famine . 
So could this crazy story be true ? Maybe 
they actually have their people through games . Saved . By getting 18 years old in the games , they flew and then these inspiration had that inspiration . And so much about coexistence . Play learned that it would make them the whole civilization saved . 
So , we can do that . 
We can play . Since 1994 Warcraft , 
that was the first strategy game . Real time , the World of Warcraft series , 
that was 16 years ago . 
They played 18 years . Craps , we &apos;ve been playing for 16 years . Warcraft : 
I claim we &apos;re ready . For our own epic game , 
so they sent half of their civilization . To search for a new world , so take me my own 21 billion hours of play a week . We should agree that the half of the world is one hour 
per day with games , and we should agree that we &apos;re spending half of our time playing . Until we solve the problems of the real 
world . I know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; How do we solve problems of the real world ? &quot; 
In games , and that &apos;s exactly the question I &apos;ve got my work in recent years at the Institute for the Future . 
We &apos;ve got this banner in our office . In Palo Alto , it expresses how we can define the future . Should 
we not try ? The future before saying what we want , 
what we want , is the future . Creating , 
we want to make the best possible outcome . Imagine and then people are empowered to do that . This idea into reality , 
we want to face epic victories , Imagine and give people the opportunity to make it happen . 
I &apos;m going to show you very briefly . Three games I designed . I have to try to make people epic victories in their own future . To make 
this happen , this is world . 
Without oil , the game . Is 2007 ? 
It &apos;s an online game . In which you have to overcome an oil shortage , 
oil scarcity is invented . But we have enough online content to make it realistic for you . And you have your real life , actually , without oil . So , live if you play the game . Tell us where you live . And then you get news films in real time . They show you how much oil costs . What it doesn &apos;t cost , how food supplies are impaired , 
how transport costs . It affects whether schools are closed . Whether it &apos;s riots . And you have to figure out how to make your real life . If it were true , and we ask you to blog about it . Video or photos , 
we have this game with 1 . 700 players . In 2007 , tested , and we &apos;ve been testing it since then over the last three years . 
And I can tell you , it was a changing experience . 
Nobody wants to live his life . Change because it &apos;s good for the environment . Or because we should . 
But if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and you &apos;re told , &quot; Get us , oil is going out . 
&quot; That &apos;s a fascinating thing . Adventure . Adventures that you &apos;re going to find . 
You figure out how you survive . Would most of our players have ? Those in the game would have retained the habits that they learned . So we &apos;ve 
chosen to go for the next world saving game , a bigger , higher goal . We &apos;ve set ourselves than just oil shortages . 
We have the game . Superstruct at the Institute . For the future . 
Designed starting point . Is the calculation ? One supercomputer that people only have to 23 years to do on the planet . 
This supercomputer is called the Global Dismortality Sensitization System , of course , the call . 
To players to sign up . Do we have almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie ? 
You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies , where it &apos;s the dream team . You have the astronaut , the scientist , the ex @-@ Sträfling , and just together . Can you make the world save 
? But in our game , instead of just five people , we say , &quot; Everyone &apos;s on the dream team , and it &apos;s our job . &quot; The future for energy , food , health . Safety and the future of social justice . To 
create 8,000 people , 8,000 players played the game . For weeks , 
they found 500 incredible . Creative solutions that they can read when they &apos;re Google Superstruct and Google 
the last game . We on March 3rd , it &apos;s a game . Working with the World Bank , 
if you play the game , you get it . You get it from the World Bank , the 2010 Social Reformer Award . We work 
with universities . Across Sub @-@ Saharan Africa , and invite you to redesign social . Learning to 
learn : We have a comic book on this . We have levels high for regional understanding . Knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and ingenuity . 
I want to invite you all to play this game with young people . Everywhere on Earth , especially in the development areas , that benefit from it . Together , you have your own social enterprise to imagine the world to 
save . I &apos;m going to finish now . 
I want you to ask something . 
What do you think ? Does next happen ? 
We have all these fantastic players . We have games that show us what we do . But can we have the real world yet ? We haven &apos;t saved . 
Well , I hope you will tell me that players agree that human resources are . We have the resources to work in real life , and that games are a big deal of importance for change . 
We have all these superpowers , happy productivity . The ability to have tight social networks , urgency optimism and desire for epiepical . Importance : 
I really hope that together we can play important games . To play on this planet for another century to 
survive , and I hope you will , with me , play such games . Design and play . 
When I go to the next decade , I &apos;m looking forward to two things . I &apos;m sure we can create every imaginable future , and that we can create all kinds of games . So can I say , let &apos;s play the world @-@ changing games . Let &apos;s start . 
Thank you . 
For some time now , I &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect . It may seem strange . That a magician is interested in it , unless you look at it like this , like me , as a deception that leads to something real . If someone is stuck with it , just believing it , 
in other words , sugar pills , in some studies , have shown a measurable effect . The placebo effect , and only because the person thinks what it is like to do . Be a pharmaceutical . Or some kind of pain management . For example , if the patient is only stuck enough to do that , there &apos;s a measurable effect in the body that you call the placebo effect . 
A deception . Will become something real ? Because somebody like this perceives it . 
So that we can also understand each other , I want to give you a basic , very simple magic trick . Show , 
and I &apos;m going to show you how it works . This is a trick . This has been a trick since at least the 1950s in every magic book for kids . 
I myself have written it from the Cub Scout Magic . The scout in the 1970s , 
I &apos;m going to learn it for you . And then explain it 
and then I &apos;m going to explain it . Why ? I explain it . 
So you see what happens . 
The knife you &apos;re able to look at , my hand you &apos;re looking at . Can 
I ? I &apos;m just going to look at the knife in my fist . 
I &apos;m pushing my sleeves back . 
And to make sure that nothing in my sleeves disappears or disappears from it . Will I just get my wrist right here ? 
And so in this way , you can see . That &apos;s not the time when anything moves , as long as I &apos;m pressured here . Can &apos;t anything in my sleeves wander ? Or come out 
and get there , and the goal is quite simple : 
I &apos;m going to open my hand . And hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife will go through my bare physical magnetism . It sits 
in fact so tight . It &apos;s in its place that I can shake it . Without that knife falling down , nothing moves . 
In my sleeves , or comes out , no trickery , and you can study everything . 
TA @-@ DA : 
Well , this is a trick that I often teach small kids . They who are interested in magic , because you can do a lot about deception . If you look more closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick to do . 
I think many of you here probably know . This trick , 
it works . Here &apos;s how 
I hold the knife . In my hand , 
I say I &apos;m going to close my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears . Or comes out , and this is a lie . 
The reason I &apos;m going to tie my wrist is because it &apos;s the real secret of the illusion . 
In the moment that I &apos;m going to shake my hand away from you . So that you can see it from behind , this finger is moving here . My index finger is just moving from there . Where it was , in a position where it was stretched out like this . 
Great trick . 
There &apos;s somebody sitting back there who had no childhood , 
so he &apos;s right here , 
and if I turn around , the finger changes its position , 
and now , you could talk about it . Why ? One deception is why . You don &apos;t perceive . That down here , there are only three fingers to see . Because the mind and the way that the mind and the way it processes information are not individually . Number one , two , three . It &apos;s you as a group , 
but that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about . Now , actually , not at all . And then I open my hand , of 
course , it &apos;s held there . But not through magnetism . My body , but through a trick . By my index finger , which is now there , 
and when I close my hand , the same thing happens by turning back . By this movement , it &apos;s hidden that the finger is moving back , 
I take this hand away . And here &apos;s the knife . 
This trick you can use to get your friends and neighbors to do . Thank you . 
Now , what does this have with the placebo effect ? 
Well , a year ago or so , I read a study that really bypassed me . Did 
I not have a doctor ? Or researchers , and that &apos;s why for me . An amazing thing . 
It has actually turned out that if you &apos;re using placebo in the form of a white pill , you can do it . In the form of an aspirin tablet , that &apos;s easy . A round white pill . Some of them have a measurable effect , 
but if they have the shape in which they &apos;re giving placebo , for example , into a smaller pill , they change it . And these blue dyes and a letter on it is the color of the measurement . It &apos;s actually measurable , 
even though none of them are any pharmaceutical ones . It &apos;s just sugar pills , 
but a white pill is not so good . It &apos;s like a blue pill . 
What made it . I really . Flip it out , 
but it turned out that &apos;s not all that . 
If you take capsules , they &apos;re even more effective than tablets of any shape . 
A colored capsule that &apos;s on one end yellow and on the other red . Is better than a white one ? Capsule , also the 
dosage . Does a role matter ? A 
pill twice . Every day , not so good . Like three pills , I can now &apos;t get to the exact statistics that I remember . 
Does I &apos;m sorry ? 
The crucial thing is that the statistics are also relevant . 
And the shape is important . 
And if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to grab the needle . 
Right ? An injection . With an ineffective one , a few milliliters , an ineffective one . Substance you give to a patient that 
generates a very strong , very powerful image . In your head , that &apos;s a lot . Stronger than a white pill . 
This graph is really , I &apos;m going to give you another time . If we have a projector , so 
the fact is , the white pill isn &apos;t so good . Like the blue pill , which isn &apos;t so good . Like a capsule . They don &apos;t do that well . They do work like the needle . 
And none of them . Does any really pharmaceutical ? Feature : It &apos;s just our belief in it . The one in us that has a stronger effect . 
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a magic trick . 
Could I take something that obviously has a deception ? And let it be real . 
Let &apos;s look like , we know . Yeah . From that study , you have to grab the needle if it goes to the point . Should 
this be ? This is an 18 @-@ inch @-@ long hat needle . It &apos;s very , very sharp . And I &apos;m going to start by doing a little sterilizing it . 
This is really my flesh . It &apos;s not Damian &apos;s . Special bred meat , this one . 
Is my skin ? This is not a special effect . Hollywood . 
I &apos;m going to now put this needle in my skin . And through it , I &apos;m going to push it up to the other side , to get out of it . 
If you &apos;re going to get bad , if you &apos;re easily fainting , I have a couple of friends . Last night . In the hotel room , I showed it to some people I didn &apos;t know , and there &apos;s a woman almost fainting . 
I &apos;m going to suggest , if you &apos;re going to get bad quickly , look for the next 30 seconds away . Or , you know what ? I &apos;m going to take the first delicate part back here . 
You can do it in a moment . You can see it away , too , if you want . 
So , it &apos;s going to be so accurate here . Where my meat starts , at the bottom of my arm , I &apos;m just going to make a little bit of a break . Do 
I really ? Sorry , she &apos;s . That &apos;s crazy . And now 
, just . A little bit . By my skin and on the other side , again , 
out . Now we &apos;re actually in the same situation . We &apos;re in the knife trick , 
about , 
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers . Or so I &apos;m 
going to show you . This is one , two , three , four , five . 
Well , yeah . 
I know what people think . If you see that , 
you say , &quot; Okay . &quot; This is certain . Not so . Bold and perverted themselves . Skin only around us , a few minutes long , to entertain . 
Well , then I &apos;ll show you . 
What does this look like ? Pretty good . 
Yes . I know , and people in the back . Tell me , okay . I have not got that right . See 
? People in the side rooms are now coming in . Let &apos;s 
let me tell you . From near , show you 
, this is really my skin . This is not a special effect . 
Hollywood , this is my flesh . And I can turn this around . 
I &apos;m sorry if you &apos;re getting bad , look away . Look not . Go . 
People in the back , or those who eventually , sometime , watch this video . Will you say , &quot; Well , yeah , that looks pretty good . &quot; Impressive . But if it &apos;s real , it would look like , &quot; Here &apos;s a hole . &quot; And there , if it was really real , it would bleed . 
Okay ? Let me just take a little blood for you . 
Yeah . Here it is . 
Normally I would now put out the needle . 
I would take my arm out . And show you that there are no wounds . 
But I think in this frame here and with the intention of getting out . A deception , something real . Will I take the needle just in there ? Let &apos;s let it happen and go from the stage . 
We &apos;ll be going to look at a couple more times in the next few days . 
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . Thank you very much . 
So I &apos;ve got a lot of fish in my life . 
I &apos;ve only loved two . 
This first one , that was more like a passionate affair . 
It was a beautiful fish . It was tasty , good consistency . Hold , best seller . On the menu , 
what a fish there is 
even better . It became aquaculture , according to the supposedly highest standards of sustainability , you could probably grow in aquaculture , 
so you could feel comfortable . It could be sold . 
I had this beauty relationship with it over several months , 
one day , the boss of the company called and asked if I was going to be speaking at an event . Could I talk about the sustainability of the farm ? 
&quot; Of course , I said , 
&quot; Here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem for our chefs had become . Is it like , do we keep fish ? On our menus , 
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the seas . How do we beat forests bare , 
it &apos;s hard to destroy , to overestimate . 
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the curative butte , the salmon , the swordfish . They &apos;ve collapsed . 
It &apos;s almost nothing more . 
So there &apos;s probably some aquaculture left , or bad aquaculture . Fish growing , part of our future . 
Its many arguments against it . Fish farming plants pollute the environment , most of them , anyway , and they &apos;re inefficient . Let &apos;s take tuna . A big disadvantage . 
It has feed recycling of 15 percent to one , 
that is , 15 pounds of wild fish . It &apos;s necessary to have a pound of farmed tuna , 
not very sustainable . 
It doesn &apos;t taste very sustainable either . 
Very good . So here was finally a company . It tried to get it right . 
I wanted to support it . 
The day before the event , I called the head of public relations for the company . 
They call him Don Don 
, and he said , &quot; I just said , &quot; The facts . Right ? &quot; &quot; Having you are famous for that . &quot; So far out in the sea . Growing . That you &apos;re not polluting the environment 
, that &apos;s true . He said , &quot; We &apos;re so far out there that the waste from our fish is distributed . &quot; Not concentrated . And 
then he added , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re basically our own world . 
This feed recovery of 2.5 to 1 &quot; he said , 
&quot; The best in the industry , 2.5 . &quot; 
One : Great , 2.5 to 
one , what feeds you ? Sustainable 
proteins , &quot; he said , 
&quot; Great . &quot; I put up 
and that evening I lay in bed and thought , &quot; What the hell ? &quot; &quot; Is sustainable ? &quot; Protein , 
so I called the next day , just before the event . Don : 
I said , &quot; Don , what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot; 
He said , &quot; He doesn &apos;t know . &quot; He &apos;s going to 
ask , &quot; Well , I telephoned a few people in the company , nobody could give me a proper answer . &quot; &quot; Give me a good answer until I finally telephoned with the leading biologist . 
&quot; Let &apos;s call him . Don Don also said , 
&quot; What ? &quot; For example , are they ? Sustainable proteins . Well 
, he mentioned some algae . And some fishmeal , and then he said , &quot; Chicken pellets . &quot; 
I said , Chicken pellets . He 
said , &quot; Yes . &quot; Feathers , skin . Bone flour . Remnants . Dried and fed . Processed . 
I said , &quot; How much percent of your food ? &quot; 
Is chicken in the assumption of maybe two percent ? 
Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent . He said , &quot; 
I said , don , what &apos;s sustainable ? &quot; Chicken in fish , feeding 
. There was a long break . There was a long break in the pipeline , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much . Chicken in the world . &quot; 
I fell in love with this fish . 
No . Not . Because I was a self @-@ righteous connoisseur and a good man . 
That &apos;s me . Even 
no . I &apos;m not really impressed by this fish . Loved because I swear to God , the fish after this conversation , after chicken tasted . Has 
this second fish ? This is another fish . Type of love story . 
It &apos;s the romantic species . The species where you ever better get your fish to know . Do you learn the fish ? The more you love it . 
I love it first in a restaurant in southern Spain . 
A friend journalist . Had long been talking about this fish . It has , in 
a way , cuffed us , and 
it came on the table . With a bright , almost shimmering white color . 
The cook had cooked it , 
just twice . 
Amazingly , he was still . Delicious . 
Who can buy a fish ? So good . Let it taste . After he was cooked , 
I can &apos;t , but this guy can &apos;t call it . 
We call it Miguel . In fact , he &apos;s called Miguel . 
And no . He has the fish . He has not cooked . And he &apos;s not a chef . At least in the way you and I are understanding it , 
he &apos;s a biologist with Veta . La Palma , 
that &apos;s a fish rearing in the southwest . Corner of Spain , 
it &apos;s near the mouth . It &apos;s the river Guadalquivir , 
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of Argentines , 
they grew meat cattle on what was basically wetlands , 
They did that by doing the land drainage . 
They built this complicated sequence of canals and they pushed water , they pushed water out of the country . And out into the river . 
Well , they couldn &apos;t make a difference . That worked , not economically 
and ecologically , . It was a disaster . 
It brought about 90 percent . The birds around . What a place , lots of birds , are . 
And so 1982 , a Spanish company with environmental awareness , the country bought the land . 
What did they do ? 
They bought the river of water reverse . 
They literally have the lever . 
Instead of pushing the water out , they used the channels to get the water back in . 
They flooded the channels . 
They created an 11,000 acres . Fish farming , perch , sea ash , shrimp . Eel . And there &apos;s Miguel and his company , the ecological destruction , completely reversed . 
The farm is incredible . 
I mean , they have something like this never seen before . They &apos;re staring out . 
They &apos;re on the horizon . One million miles away . Is and everything they see is , flooded . Channels and this dense , lush march . 
I was there , not long ago . With Miguel , 
he &apos;s an incredible guy . Three parts : Charles Darwin and one part : A crocodile . To kiss , 
okay , there we were and fought . Through us through wetlands and I chastise and sweat , I have mud up to my knees and Miguel keeps in the peace . A biology lecture 
here , he lifts a rare track . 
Now he mentions mineral needs of phytoplankton 
and here , here &apos;s where he sees a pattern . From bundles that bind him up . Tanzanian giraffe reminds you . 
It turns out that Miguel has the biggest part of his career in Mikumi National Park in Africa . He &apos;s spent the most of his career in Mikumi National Park in Africa . 
I asked him how he became a fish expert . 
He said , &quot; Fish , I don &apos;t know . It &apos;s about fish . 
I &apos;m an expert in relationships . And 
then he goes and falls and falls into more talk . &quot; Rare birds and algae and weird algae and aquatic plants , 
and you know ? Don &apos;t get me wrong . That was really fascinating . You know , the biotic community Unplugged , so in the way 
it &apos;s great , but I was in love . 
And my head got weak . Over this cooked piece of delicious fish that I had on the eve . 
So I got him interrupted . I said , Miguel . &quot; How is it coming ? &quot; That your fish is so good . He 
pointed to algae . 
&quot; I know boy , the algae of phytoplankton . &quot; The relationships , that &apos;s incredible . 
But what do your fish eat ? 
How is the recycling of feed ? &quot; 
Well , he goes on . I tell you that it &apos;s such a rich system . That the fish eat what they eat in the wilderness would eat . 
The vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton -- that &apos;s what the fish feed . 
The system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self @-@ explanatory . 
There &apos;s no food . 
The way a farm owns its own animals is that it doesn &apos;t feed their animals , and it drove 
later on the day . I went on this plot with Miguel . Around . And I asked him , &quot; I said , for a place that &apos;s so natural , it seems different from any farm . On which I &apos;ve ever been , how do you measure success ? &quot; 
In the moment , it was as if a film director was demanding a stage change . 
And we bowed around the corner and us offered ourselves the opportunity for the most incredible sight . Thousands and thousands of pinkers , flamingos . A literally pinker . Carpet as far as the eye is . 
Is that enough ? That &apos;s success . He said , 
&quot; Look at her bellies . &quot; Pink . 
They &apos;re slugging , slugging 
. I was completely confused . 
I said Miguel . &quot; Don &apos;t sludge . &quot; &quot; Your fish . &quot; 
&quot; Yes . &quot; He said , 
&quot; We are losing 20 % . Percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds . 
Well , last year , on this plot , 600,000 birds were there . More than 250 different species . 
It &apos;s today the largest and one of the most important private bird reserves in Europe . I became a member of the private bird reserve . 
I said , Miguel is a well @-@ thriving bird population , not the last one to be reared on a fish farm . Does 
he want to shake his head ? No . 
He said , &quot; We &apos;re building extensively , not . Intensive . 
This is what we &apos;re building . &quot; Is an ecological network ? 
The flamingos eat the shrimps . 
The shrimps eat the phytoplankton . 
The pinker the belly , the better the system . Okay 
? Let &apos;s do a rethink . A farm that has no feeding its animals . And a farm that has its success in health at the health of its predators . 
A fish rearing , but also a bird reserve . 
Oh , and by the way , these flamingos shouldn &apos;t even be there from the outset . 
They breed in a city 240 kilometers away . Where the soil quality is better for nest building 
every morning , flies . They fly 240 kilometers to the farm . 
And every night , they fly 240 kilometers . Back , 
they do that because they &apos;re the white line of the A92 highway 
that you can follow yesterday . Seriously , 
I had a kind of journey that penguins had imagined . So I looked at Miguel , 
I said Miguel . Fly 240 . Kilometers to the farm and fly them then . 240 kilometers back in the evening 
. Do that for the kids . He 
looked at me as if I had just heard a song from Whitney Houston , quoting 
him , &quot; No , you &apos;re doing that . Because the food is better . &quot; 
I don &apos;t have the skin of my lover . Fisch mentioned . The delicious . Was and I don &apos;t like the skin of fish . I like it . Not sauté . I like it . Not . 
Crispy . It &apos;s this biting . Cowed taste : 
I almost never cook with it , and 
yet , when I put it in this restaurant in southern Spain , it didn &apos;t have it at all after skin of fish . 
It tasted sweet . And it tasted pure as if you had a bite from the ocean . 
I mentioned that to Miguel , and he nodded . 
He said , &quot; The skin looks like a sponge . 
&quot; It &apos;s the last defense . Before anything happens in the body , 
it has become more and more evolutionary , as it has evolved . To suck up impurities , 
and then he added , &quot; But our water has no impurities . &quot; 
Okay . A farm that has no fish feeding . A farm that has measured its success in the success of its predators . 
And then I realized , if it says , &quot; A farm that doesn &apos;t have impurities , it undermines enormously . &quot; Because the water that goes through this farm comes from the farm from the Guadalquivir River . 
In . It &apos;s a river . It &apos;s all the things that carry with it rivers today , which tend to be with them , to lead them . Chemical pollutants , outflow of pesticides , 
and if it goes through the system , and if it leaves , it &apos;s the water . Cleaner than it came in than it came in , 
the system is so healthy . It cleans the water . 
So not only a farm . They clean their animals , not only a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , but also a farm that measures their success in the health of their predators . But a farm that literally has a water treatment plant , and not just for these fish , but also for you . And me , 
because if the water flows out , it sinks into the Atlantic , 
a drop in the ocean , I know , but I take it , and you should . Because do this love story , romantic , whatever it is . Also instructive . 
You might say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future , for the future . Good food , whether we &apos;re from beef or meat cattle , 
what we need now . Is it a radically new one ? Concept of agriculture , from one in which food is actually good . 
But for many people , this is a little too radical . 
We &apos;re not realists . We enjoy . We &apos;re lovers . 
We love weekly markets . We love small family farms . We talk about regional food . We eat organic , 
and if you claim that &apos;s what things are , the things that are the future of good food . Does anybody stand up somewhere and say , &quot; Hey guys , I love pink . &quot; Flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ? How 
are you going to feed the world ? 
Can I be honest . 
I like this question . Not 
no . Not . Because we already have enough calories . To feed the world more than just to feed the world , 
a billion people will . Today , a 
billion are starving , that &apos;s more than ever before . Because of stark inequalities in distribution , not total production . 
Well , I like this question . Not because you have the logic of our food system , the last 50 years , determined . 
Feed grain . Vegetable pesticides , monocultures , chemicals , chemicals , the Earth . Chicken of fish and the whole time has the agricultural industry just asked . If we have more people feeding cheaper , how horrible can that be ? That 
was the reason . It was the justification . It was the business plan . The American agriculture . 
We should call it . What it is a business in liquidation , a business that &apos;s fast growing environmental capital , which is exactly what makes this production possible . 
That &apos;s not a business . And it &apos;s not agriculture . 
Our grain chamber is threatened today . Not because of decreasing . Supply , but because of decreasing resources . 
Not because of the latest mower and tractor inventions , but because of fruitful ones . Country , not by pumps , but by fresh ones . Water , not by chainsaws . But by forests . And not by fishing boats . And nets , but by fish in the sea . They 
want to feed the world . 
Let &apos;s start with the question of how are we going to feed ourselves ? 
Or better . How can we create conditions ? Which each community can empower itself to feed itself to feed that 
to do . Look , don &apos;t look at the agricultural industrial model for the future . 
It &apos;s really old . And it &apos;s done . 
Capital , chemistry and machines . They &apos;re on top of it . And it never has anything really good to eat . 
Produced . Let &apos;s look instead at the ecological model . 
This is the one that &apos;s on two billion years of work experience . Retrowing back . Look at Miguel . 
Farmers like Miguel . Farmers like Miguel . 
Farmers who don &apos;t have worlds for themselves . Are farms that restore ? Instead of using up farms that grow extensively , rather than just intensive farmers , who are not just producers . But experts on relationships . 
Because they are the ones who are experts on taste . 
And if I really am honest , they are a better cook . When I ever be , 
you know , you know , that &apos;s right . Because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it becomes delicious . 
His thanks . 
I grew up with a lot . Portion of science fiction 
in my school days , I drove with the bus . I drove to school every day , one hour per way . And my 
nose was always in a book . A science fiction book , my thoughts . Other worlds , kidnapped and narrated . My deep , deep . In me , insatiable curiosity . Satisfied this curiosity . 
Showed up in it as well . That I always , if I &apos;m not in school , was driven by forests . Wandered and sampled , frogs . And snakes . And beetle And pond water , everything . Home brought home and brought under the microscope , 
looked at , I was totally science @-@ excited . 
You know , it always was about the attempt . The world to understand and the boundaries of what is possible 
and to explore my love of science . Fiction seemed to be around me , because back then , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea . 
Jacques Cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating shows . They were the animals and places we live in , and a world full of wonders . They were the ones we never imagined before 
: This then happened , I think , very well . And then it fits with that science fiction role , 
and I was an artist . 
I could draw , I could paint , 
and because it wasn &apos;t video games , nor was it saturation with computer @-@ generated films , nor was it the whole visual language . In the media landscape , I had to give the images in my head . 
That &apos;s what we all had to do when we were kids reading a book , and we took the author &apos;s description and projected it . The canvas in our heads 
, my reaction to it . Was drawing and painting ? From aliens alien worlds , robots , spacecraft and all of that . 
Mathelition taught me all the time by the teacher . Like me in the textbook , 
hiding around , painting around , creativity just had to get out of it somehow . 
And it was an interesting thing that happened to me , Jacques Cousteaus , that fascinated me with shows . Was the idea of a totally us unknown world ? Here on our planet 
, even surely I would never have a alien world with an alien ship , reaching . That seemed pretty unlikely to me . 
But here was a world I was actually entering . Here on Earth . And it was just as fascinating . And exotic as all that I was looking at , what I &apos;d always imagined . When I was reading these books , 
so I decided when I was 15 , I was going to become a diver . 
The only problem with this was that I was in a small village in Canada . 1,000 miles from the next ocean . 
Away from that . Let &apos;s go . I let myself not . Discouraged . 
I was annoying my father . Until he finally got a diving school in Buffalo , New York , to find out . Right on the other side of the border , where we lived , 
I made my diving certificate in a pool . The YMCA , in the middle of winter in Buffalo , New York , 
the ocean . But a real ocean I got only two years . Later on . When we went to California , 
since then , in the 40 years that have passed . Have I got about 3,000 hours under water ? 500 hours of that in submersible boats , 
and I &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea itself is in the flatter oceans , so rich in fascinating life . Is how we feel it really hard to imagine ? Can imagination of 
nature know ? No limits . All the contrary to our own miserable . 
Human imagination to this day feels like I have the deepest awe . For what I do on my dives , 
and for what I love about the ocean . Keep on with the same intensity as ever before , 
when I remember then as an adult , as an adult , I was a profession . 
It was filming . That seemed to be the best way to make my inner urge . Stories to tell with my need to take pictures . 
To unite as a child drew . I kept drawing comic books . And so 
, films were the way , pictures and stories . To merge that . Together , 
of course , the stories I chose were the stories . From the science fiction field : Terminator Aliens . And Abyss at Abyss . Could 
I share my love for the underwater world and diving with the filmmaking ? 
So , intertwined . So my two passions sort of intertwined 
something interesting . And happened at Abyss . To make a narrative problem in this movie , and that &apos;s what we had to do , we had to create a kind of liquid water system . Let &apos;s grab computer @-@ generated animation CG . 
What came out of this was the first computer @-@ generated soft surface figure . The one ever in a movie to 
be seen was the film , which didn &apos;t bring money . It was a , to put it mildly , just playing its production costs . But one thing I noticed was something fascinating . The audience on the whole world was like hypnotized . The magic of 
the one that was thought to be Arthur Clarke &apos;s law is , as you know , advanced technology . And magic is no longer . To distinguish them from each other , so 
they saw something magical . 
And that &apos;s what I found incredibly exciting . 
And I thought , &quot; Wow , that absolutely must be in the art of film . So 
, we went to Terminator . &quot; Two , my next movie , much further . 
Together with ILM , we created the guy there . We made liquid metal . Success was very much dependent on that . Like this effect would arrive , 
and it worked . Again , we had created something magical . And the effect in the audience was the same , but we did with the film already a little more money , from these two 
experiences , we recorded . And starting with this , a whole new world . Achieved a whole new world . Creativity for filmmakers , 
so I started a company together with a company that was good friend Stan Winston , who was at that time the best make @-@ up and creature designer , called Digital Domain . 
The basic idea of this company was to start the phase of analog processes . With optical printers , etc . , skip and do the same with digital productions . 
And we did . Then we did , and we did , for a while , 
a competitive advantage . But in the mid @-@ 1990s , we realized that we were in the Creature and Character Design , for which we actually founded the company . We were too slow to move forward . 
I had this piece of Avatar . Written . This is the benchmark in visual effects and computer @-@ generated effects across new heights . It was meant to push with realistic human expressive characters made using CG , which were human expressive . And the main characters were meant to be all CG . And the world was supposed to be CG . 
But the bar pressed pretty much back and the people in the world in my company told me that for the time being , we &apos;re not yet able to do that . 
So I shifted that , and I did this other movie . About the big ship that goes down 
, the film studio , I used that as Romeo and Juliet on a ship . It became a love movie of epic proportions , a passionate movie . Secretly 
, but I actually wanted to become a real wreck . The Titanic , diving 
down , so I made the film . 
This is the truth . The studio knew this , but not . I have it , 
but I convinced it by saying , &quot; We dive to the wreck . We film . &quot; The real wreck , 
we &apos;ll do it in the opening sequence of the film . 
This is incredibly important . It &apos;s a good trailer . It &apos;s for marketing , 
and I persuaded you to do an expedition . It 
sounds crazy to finance . But that &apos;s okay again . And that &apos;s because your imagination is a reality . 
Can we create ? &quot; Then actually , six months later , we created a reality where I was in a Russian submersible . Four kilometers below the surface of the North Atlantic , and I was able to see the real Titanic through a bullet . That was 
not a movie . No HD . That was real . 
So , that really bypassed me . 
And the preparations for that were enormous . We had to have cameras and headlights and everything . 
And I fell on how much these deep @-@ sea dive gears were . A space mission looked 
like , &quot; Well , yeah . They were also high @-@ tech . And they needed extensive planning . 
You get up . You get into that capsule . You float into that dark , hostile environment . Down where there &apos;s no hope . On rescue , if you don &apos;t yourself get it back 
and I thought to myself , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s the same as if I were in a science fiction movie . 
&quot; That &apos;s really cool . I 
was really obsessed . I was obsessed with exploring the deep sea , at least the part 
that was related to curiosity and science . Has it been ? It was all . It was adventure . It was curiosity . It was imagination . 
And it was an experience . It was not giving me Hollywood , 
because , you know , I could give myself a creature for which we then imagined a visual effect , and then we created a visual effect . But could I imagine , I couldn &apos;t imagine what I was outside the window ? 
Would some of the expeditions that followed me have beings in thermal springs ? And sometimes things that I &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that I &apos;ve seen before , sometimes things that nobody had ever seen before . And for those who have science at the time we saw it , even no words for . 
Found . Did that have me right ? Turned it around , and I wanted more , 
and so I met . A slightly unusual one . Decision 
after success . From Titanic , I said , okay . I want to do my main job . As a filmmaker in Hollywood , I put on ice and I &apos;m going to be a full @-@ time researcher for a while , 
and then we started planning these expeditions . 
We showed up to Bismarck and we explored them with robotic vehicles , 
we went to the wreck . The Titanic , 
we took small robots . We built them , which were a fiberglass cable , 
and our intention was to do it . Dive in and get inside the ship and see what never before has been done . 
Nobody had ever had the inside of the wreck explored . You had not had the means yet . So for that , we developed the technology we needed . 
So , there I am sitting on the deck . The Titanic . In a submersible boat , and I see planks planking these boards quite similar here . And of those I know once that once the band was playing there . 
And I &apos;m flying with a little robot vehicle through the aisles . The ship : 
I &apos;m actually operating it , but my consciousness is inside the vehicle , actually . 
It felt like it was me playing physically . Within the shipwreck of the Titanic , 
there was the surreal form . One déjà vu I &apos;ve ever experienced , because before I was around a corner , I knew I always knew I was about to be in the light cone of the vehicle . Would I be over the movie set for months ? When we watched the film , 
the set was a precise set , a copy . The blueprints of the ship , 
so that was a very strange one . 
Experience : She made me aware of this telepresence experience . That you could have robotic avatars like this , and so you could put your consciousness into the vehicle in this different form . Existence shifts can move . 
It was really incredibly profound . 
And maybe also a little bit of a view . So what might be in some decades &apos; time . Could you , if you have cyborg bodies to explore something ? Or other things to do ? In all kinds of post @-@ human future scenarios that I think I can imagine as a science fiction fan . 
After these expeditions , we started what we were down there seeing , right ? Really ? Precious learning . For example , these deep sea equals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . These are , like , aliens . But here on Earth . 
They live with the help of chemosynthesis . 
They don &apos;t exist in sunlight . They exist in a system based on sunlight , as we do . 
And this is how you see animals . They &apos;re right next to a 500 degrees Celsius water cloud . And 
you can &apos;t imagine that you &apos;re there to survive . Can you survive 
at the same time ? I also became very interested in space science . That was the science fiction influence again . From my childhood 
and so I ended up with people who were interested in the space world , and I was very interested in space . And those with NASA , I was involved in NASA &apos;s expert council , and I was planning real space missions . They &apos;re going to Russia . They &apos;re going through before the mission . They &apos;re going through the biomedical protocol , including the biomedical protocol . All the same . They &apos;re going to fly to the international . Space Station and take our 3D camera systems with them . 
That was fascinating . 
But at the end of the day , it went on . That I was a space scientist with us going into the deep sea . 
I took them and I was going to give them access to the world . Down there , astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were committed to these extreme situations . I took them to the sources with me so that they could look around , take samples . And test instruments and try and so on . 
We turned documentary films , but we actually did science , more specifically space science , 
so the circle closed . Between my existence as a science fiction fan , then as a child , and implementation . 
In reality , over the course of this discovery journey , I learned a lot . 
I learned a lot about science . But I also learned a lot about leadership . 
Now you probably think of a director as having to lead . Can a leader be ? How a ship captain or something ? I understood , but not a lot . 
Leadership before I could do these expeditions , because on a certain point 
, I had to say what to do , what to do ? Actually , here &apos;s 
why . Do I do that ? What &apos;s going to happen ? Out of these stupid movies , 
we don &apos;t get money . One : We &apos;re 
just playing the production costs . One of fame , no trace . 
Everybody thinks I &apos;m between Titanic . And Avatar walked away and would have somewhere nails on a nails on a towel . On the beach , 
I &apos;d been celebrating all these movies , these documentary films , for a very small audience . 
Not fame . Not honor . Not money . What are you doing ? Only 
you &apos;re doing it . To do the job , to challenge the challenge and the ocean is the most challenging environment . It &apos;s you . You &apos;re doing it of exploratory noise . Because of and because of the strange connection that emerges when a small group of people , a team , form . 
Because we have all of this with just 10 to 12 people , we &apos;ve done it . They &apos;ve been working together for years , and sometimes we &apos;ve been two to three months in a row at sea 
and in this community . You can see that the most important thing is respect , respect , that you have for each other . Because you have a task to do . That you have not been able to explain to anyone else 
when you return to land . And you say , &quot; We had to do it . &quot; The fiberglass , the sound attenuation and the all around , the whole technology . And the difficulties , the human performance . If you go to sea , you can do the other thing , you can &apos;t explain . That &apos;s like policemen or policemen or soldiers . They have gone through something together , and they know they never have anybody to explain it . 
And there &apos;s a connection . There &apos;s mutual respect . 
So when I came back to my next movie , Avatar . So I tried to make the same leadership style . That is , you respect your team and you can actually , in exchange , 
earn respect for it . And that made the dynamics really 
change . And I stood there again . So with a small team on unknown terrain , we turned Avatar with a new technology . It used to be that there was no such thing 
as exciting . 
It &apos;s a tremendous challenge , 
and we got a four and a half years &apos; time into a real family . 
And that changed my way of making films . 
It changed completely . There were people who thought we had these ocean properties , yeah , really good . They were imitating them and transporting them to Pandora , and 
for me it was more of a principled way of doing my job . To do the real process , which is resulting in change . 
Has what can we do from all of this , 
what lessons do we have ? We learned . 
I believe , first of all . Is curiosity ? 
It &apos;s the most powerful human property . Our 
imagination is a force that even has a reality . Can 
and can respect your team is . More important than all the laurels of this world to me . 
Come on young filmmakers who say , &quot; Give me a gift . &quot; A advice like me on how to do this . And 
I say , &quot; Don &apos;t limit you . &quot; Even 
one that already concerns . Others for you do not . You self bet . Not against yourself . But take yourself . Risk 
. Take on yourself . NASA . Has such a favorite sentence ? Failure . Is 
not an alternative ? But in art and in exploration and exploration , failure has to be an alternative . Because there it guarantees a benefit of trust , 
not an important one . Undertake innovation . Demanded has ever been approached without risk , 
you have to be ready to take risks like 
that . That &apos;s the idea . I want to share with you with you the idea that failure is a failure is an alternative . Fear is not , however , thank you . 
If I can tell you one thing today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data , the data we consume , is larger . As the sum of your parts , and instead of overloading information , think of it . I want you to think about it . How we can use information in a way that gives rise to patterns . And we can see trends that otherwise don &apos;t see . 
We would have become something like this . Is a typical death chart ? By age , 
the program I &apos;m here using is a program that &apos;s a little experiment . 
It &apos;s called Pivot . And what I &apos;m doing with Pivot is that I &apos;m going to go to filter for a certain cause of death . Can we say accidents , 
and immediately I see another cause ? Patterns that emerge and 
that are because in the middle , here , people are most active . And you over here , they &apos;re most frail . 
We can go one step further and sort out the data , then rearrange it . And you can see that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects . But not for everyone , 
if we go on and age @-@ sort sort them , we say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents , even the main cause . About those that people worry about , people should worry about , 
and who looks at them further . That &apos;s particularly true for men . 
Is it true ? So you realize that the image of information and data in this way is very much swimming . In a vivid graphic of information , 
and if we think about raw data , why not ? Why not content itself ? 
What we &apos;re having here is the cover images of each individual . Sports Illustrated , which have ever been printed . 
It &apos;s all here . It &apos;s all online . 
You can like to do it after I gave my talk in your rooms . 
With Pivot , you can dive in . You can dive into a decade . 
You can dive into a given year . 
You can go directly to a particular issue . 
If I &apos;m looking here , I see the athletes who are in this issue . And the sports , 
I &apos;m a lance . Armstrong . Fan : So I click here . What makes me spend all the time showing Lance Armstrong mentioning . 
Now , if I just have a bigger overview . I want to think , OK ? What if I wanted to do everything about cycling ? So 
I go and take a step back . And I expand the perspective . 
Now I see Greg , Lemon , 
and so you get an idea . That if you look at this way of looking through information , you zoom in more targeted , wider , zoom out , you don &apos;t look . Or you don &apos;t surf . Just 
you . You do something that actually does a little bit differently . 
It &apos;s something in between . And we think it changes the way it changes the way information is used . 
Can I want to take this idea a little bit further ? With about what a little bit crazy is . 
What we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve got every single wikipedia page taken , and put it on a little summary . 
The summary contains a quick overview . And a symbol of the range from there . To which it comes , 
I &apos;ll just show you the top 500 of the most popular . Wikipedia pages , 
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things . 
Immediately , we get an idea of the issues . The ones on Wikipedia are the most popular , 
I &apos;m going to vote on the issue of government . 
Now , after I &apos;ve elected government , I realize that the Wikipedia categories that are most concerned with this are the Wikipedia categories . Time Magazines : People of the Year . 
Are these really important ? Because this is a realization that is not in a single Wikipedia page . 
This is just to be seen . If you take a step back and you look at the whole thing , 
looking at one of these summaries . Can I then go into the subject of Time ? Magazines : People of the Year , and everybody together , when I 
go to see all these people , I see that the majority of them are government officials . Some of them come from science . Some of them come from economics , some even less . Here &apos;s my boss . And one comes from music , 
and interestingly , Bono . Also , a TED Prize . Winners , 
so we can jump now and take a look at all the TED Prize . 
Winners , throw you , we can surf . On the net for the first time , as if it really is a web . Not only from side to side , but much more abstract . 
And so I want to tell you something else . What a little surprise might be , I &apos;ll show you . 
You can just show you the New York . Times &apos; website 
Pivot : This application . I don &apos;t want to call it a browser . It &apos;s really not a browser . But you can use it to look at websites . And we bring this zoom technology to every single website . Like this , 
so I can take a step back . And right back to a specific section , 
jump , and that &apos;s important because you can only look at websites by looking at websites of this kind . All the Internet history to the same way , look at the same way . 
I can , therefore , zoom in into my course , in a certain time frame 
, and here &apos;s the state of play . The whole demonstration I &apos;ve been going to hold up to this point , 
and I can sort of see everything I &apos;ve been looking at today . 
I can bring back again . And if I go back a step and get back on everything , I can . I can retrace my course . Maybe after my search past here , I &apos;ve been looking for nepotistic . Here &apos;s Bing , or here &apos;s live Labs , Pivot 
and from here , I can go to the page . And you can go back to 
it . It &apos;s a metaphor . It &apos;s used over and over again , and every time it does that . Overall picture bigger . Than the sum of the data pieces 
right now in this world thinking . We think that data is a curse . 
We talk about the curse of the abundance of information , 
we talk about drowning in information . 
What if we were to reverse this situation ? And the Internet on its head . So that we , instead of always being from one to the other , start . Many things to many things go from one to the other . To be able to see patterns , and thereby to see patterns that would otherwise have been hidden . 
If we do this , then it will be this data trap that we &apos;ve seen so far , maybe a new source , more meaningful . 
Information , and instead of just just getting information . Moving around , we can get knowledge from it . 
And if we know , then we can maybe even know wisdom from it . 
So I stop hearing this . Thank you very much . 
Everybody &apos;s talking today about happiness . 
I have some people , the number of books counts . Let those with happiness in the title in the last five years published in the last five years . And they gave after about 40 , and it was still there a lot more . 
There &apos;s a huge wave of interest in it . Happiness among researchers . 
There &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching . 
Everybody would like to make people happier . 
But despite all this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps . They sort of make it almost impossible to understand how lucky it is to think , 
and my talk today will be . It &apos;s mainly these cognitive traps that will act . 
That &apos;s true for laymen who are talking about their own happiness . And it &apos;s true for scientists who are thinking about happiness because it turns out that we &apos;re just as confused . Like everybody else , 
the first of these traps is a reluctance to complexity . To admit , 
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not a useful word anymore . Because we put it on too many different things . 
I think there &apos;s a certain meaning to which we apply it to . But could it be , by and large , something that we give up ? Will it be , and we will be taking the complicated view ? Do we have to take what well @-@ being is ? 
The second case is confusion between what experience is . And memory is basically , it &apos;s between happiness . In his life and being happy about his life or being happy . With his life , 
and these are two very different concepts . And they &apos;re both thrown together . In the idea of happiness and happiness , 
and the third is the concentration illusion . And that &apos;s the unfortunate fact . That we don &apos;t know what a circumstance we can think about . Well @-@ being affects without its meaning . Distorting . 
I mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive trap . 
There &apos;s just no way . It &apos;s right . 
Getting to get to . Well , I &apos;d like to start with an example . Someone who has a question and answer session after one of my lectures , who reported a story , was unclear , he said he &apos;d heard a symphony . And it was absolutely magnificent . ( Music ) And at the very end of the recording , there was a terrible one . Creating sound , 
and then he added . Really ? Pretty emotional . This has all the experience . Ruined , 
but it didn &apos;t . 
What it ruined was the memories of the memories of the experience . 
He had the experience . 
He had 20 minutes more glorious . 
( Music ) They didn &apos;t count . Because he had a memory left him . The memory was ruined . And the memory was everything he was to keep to . He had 
what this really tells us . Is that we are talking about ourselves and about other people ? Could we think about two kinds of self , 
there &apos;s a living self that &apos;s in the present , in the sense of two kinds of self . And the present knows how capable it is of rebuilding the past . But basically , only the present . Has 
it ? Is it the living self ? Is it the doctor who primes ? You know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Is it doing it now ? &quot; &quot; Woe if I touch you here , &quot; 
and then there &apos;s a memory self . And the memory self is that . It &apos;s that that &apos;s widening . And the story of our lives is maintaining , and it &apos;s that that the doctor addresses . By taking the question of , &quot; How did you feel at home recently ? &quot; 
Or , &quot; What was your journey like ? &quot; To Albania or something . Similar . 
These are two very different units . The living self and the remembering self and the two to the confuse is part of the unity . The concept of happiness . 
Well , the remembering self . Is a storyteller ? 
And that really starts with a fundamental reaction . It &apos;s about our memories . It &apos;s about to start . 
We don &apos;t just tell stories when we get to it . Stories about telling , 
our memory . Tell us stories . That means what we &apos;re told about our experiences is that what we can keep is a story . 
And let &apos;s not let you take an example . 
There &apos;s an old study . 
That &apos;s real patients who are one of the patients who undergo a painful procedure . 
I &apos;m not going to go into detail . It &apos;s not anymore painful today . But it was painful . When this study was done in the 1990s , 
they were asked to do it every 60 seconds , every 60 seconds , about their pain . And 
here are two patients . These are their records . 
And they &apos;re asked , who of both has suffered more ? And 
that &apos;s a very simple question . 
Patient B clearly has suffered more . His intestinal reflection was longer and every minute of pain , the patient A had . Was patient B and more , 
but now there &apos;s another one , question . How much did these patients think ? That they suffered , 
and here &apos;s a surprise . And 
the surprise is that patient A has a much worse memory of patient A. As patient B has 
the stories of intestinal reflections , different , and because a very critical part of the story is . How it ends 
and none of these stories is very edifical . Or great , but one of them is this clear , but one of them is clear . Worse than the other , 
and the one that is worse , was the one where the pain was at the very end of its peak . It &apos;s a bad story . 
How do we know that ? 
Because we &apos;re going to look at these people for their spinal reflections . And also much later . How bad was the whole thing ? Overall , 
and it was much worse . For A than for B in the memory , 
well , that &apos;s a direct conflict . Between the living self and the remembering self 
from the point of view of the living . Even B had clearly a worse time . 
Now , what you do with patient A , and we have actually clinical experiments done , actually . And it &apos;s done . It &apos;s been done . And it works . You could actually do the intestinal reflection of patient A by extending just the tube in it by leaving it . Without too much on it to shake , 
that &apos;s going to lead to that . That the patient suffers , but only a little bit less and much less than before . 
And if you do that for a few minutes , you have done it . That the living self of patient A is worse off . And you have made it so that the remembering self of patient A is much better off . Because now you have patient A , a better story about your experience , given . 
What is the record of a story ? 
And that &apos;s the story . Those that memory gives us , and it &apos;s also true of stories . Those that we invent , which is 
what makes a story unique . Are upheavals ? Significant moments and ends . 
Ends . Very , very important . And in this case , the end 
now dominated the living self , lives . His life continuous , 
it has moments of experience . One after the other , 
and you ask , what happens to these moments ? 
And the answer is really simple . They &apos;re forever lost . 
I mean , most moments of our lives , and I have just calculated this . You know , the psychological presence . Is considered to be about three seconds . Long . What does knowledge mean ? Do you know that in a life , there are about 600 million of them . In a month , there are about 600,000 of them , most of whom leave . There &apos;s no trace , 
most of them . Are completely ignored . Remembering yourself 
and yet , you get some sort of impression . That you should count . That what &apos;s going on during these moments of experience , our lives , is . 
It &apos;s the limited resource that we consume . While we &apos;re in this world , 
and how we consume it . Would it seem important ? But that &apos;s not the story . Those who are the remembering self for us , 
so we have the remembering . Even and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different . 
The biggest difference between them is the way they deal with time . 
From the perspective of the living self . If you &apos;re on vacation and you &apos;re on a second week just as good . Is like the first , then the two @-@ week one . Holiday twice as good as the one @-@ week one . Holiday , 
that &apos;s how it works . It doesn &apos;t work at all . For the memory self , 
for the memory self , a two @-@ week holiday is . Hardly better than the one @-@ week holiday , because there are no new memories added . 
You have the story not changed . 
And on that way , time is actually the critical variable . One reminder self distinguishes from a memory self living , time . Has very little influence . On that story , 
now the memory self makes more than one reminder . And stories to tell , 
it &apos;s actually the one . The decisions are made , because if you have a patient who , let &apos;s say , has two intestinal reflections in two different surgeons . Had and decided which one to choose . Should then be the one who chooses ? The one who has the memory , which is less bad . And that &apos;s the surgeon who has to be selected . Will 
the living self have ? No voice . In this election , actually , 
we don &apos;t vote . Between experiences , we choose between memories of experiences . 
And even if we think about the future , we think about our future . Normally not as experiences , 
we think about our future . After , as anticipated memories , 
and basically , you can look at that . You know , as a tyranny of the memory self , and you can look at the memory self . As one , which is the living self , so to speak . Put through experience . Those who live the living self . Not what I need . 
I have the impression that if we go on vacation , very often it &apos;s the case . That means we go on vacation as far as possible . We go on vacation at the service of the memory self , 
and that &apos;s a little bit hard . To justify , I think 
I mean how much we feed on our memories . 
That &apos;s one of the explanations that &apos;s been given for the dominance of the memory self . 
And if I think about that , I think about a vacation that we &apos;re going to spend a few years ago in Antarctica . The one that &apos;s clearly the best vacation I &apos;ve ever had . And I think relatively often about that relative to how often I have to think about other vacations 
and I have a probably from my memories of my memories of this three @-@ week journey . I would say , about 25 minutes . In the last four years , 
I &apos;ve been dragged , well , if I &apos;d ever opened the folder with the 600 images in it , I &apos;d spent another hour . 
Well , that &apos;s three weeks . And that &apos;s at most one and a half hours , it seems . 
It seems to be disagreement . 
Well , I like a little extreme . You know , in it , how little appetite I have for feeding ? Of memories , though , even if they have more of them , there &apos;s a real question . Why do we give memories ? So much weight in the lurch . To the weight we have to give experiences , 
so I want you to talk about a thought experiment . 
Imagine if you &apos;re going to spend your next vacation , you know that at the end of your vacation , all your images are destroyed . And you get an amnesty drug like this , so you get nothing to remember . 
Now , you would have to choose the same vacation . And if you had another vacation , you would have a different conflict . There &apos;s a conflict between your two kinds of self , and you have to think about it . How you might decide this conflict , and that &apos;s really real . Not obvious , because if you &apos;re in the sense of time , you get an answer . And if you &apos;re in the sense of memory , you could think of a different answer . 
Why ? We , the vacations , choose . The ones we choose is a problem . That &apos;s what we face with a choice between the two species . 
The self , well , the two kinds of self , throw two terms . Of happiness , 
there are actually two concepts : Happiness , the happiness we can apply . One per self , 
so you can ask , how happy is the living ? Even then , 
and then you would ask , how happy are the moments in life ? The living self , 
and you &apos;re all happiness . For moments , it &apos;s a pretty complicated one . 
Process : What are the emotions ? They are what can be measured . 
And by the way , we are now able to have a pretty good idea . We get happiness from the living self , from time to 
time , when it &apos;s after happiness from the remembering self , it &apos;s a very different thing . 
This is not about it . How happy a person lives it . 
Is about how satisfied or happy ? The person is when that person is informed about his or her life , 
very different terms , 
each person who doesn &apos;t distinguish these terms . Will research into happiness melt up ? And I &apos;m one of a lot of researchers about well @-@ being . Those who study happiness for a long time get bogged down . 
Have you got that kind of distinction between happiness in the same way that the living self and happiness in the memory self is . Is in the last few years recognized and now trying to do something about the two separately ? To measure 
the Gallup Organization has a global survey of the world , where more than half a million people . Questions asked . Have they been asked ? Have they been asked about what they are about their lives ? Thinking and about their experiences ? And there were other efforts in the direction of 
what they &apos;ve been doing in recent years . So we &apos;ve started to think about the happiness of the two kinds of self . 
And the main lesson we think we have learned , I think , is that they really are different . 
You can know how satisfied someone is with their lives . And that &apos;s what they really teach you . Not much about it . How happy he is . Life lives , and vice versa . 
Just to give you an idea of the correlation between them . Correlation is about five percent 
, which means that . Is that if you meet someone , and you would meet them , you would tell them , &quot; Oh , his father is a two @-@ meter man . How much would you know about his size ? 
&quot; Well , you would know something about his size . But there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty . 
You have so much uncertainty . 
If I tell you that somebody is going to live his life as eight on a scale of 10 . Have you got a lot of uncertainty ? How happy he is ? With his living self . 
Correlation is therefore low . 
We know something about it . What happiness is about happiness itself determines , 
we know money is very important . Goals are very important . 
We know happiness is primarily about happiness . Satisfied . Being satisfied with people we like , time to spend , time to people we like , 
it &apos;s other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant , 
if you &apos;re going to be lucky for the two types of self . If you want to , you end up doing very different things . So 
the conclusion from what I &apos;m saying here is that what we &apos;re lucky about is really not supposed to imagine . As a substitute for well @-@ being , 
it &apos;s a completely different term . 
Now , very briefly , another reason for us not to be clear about happiness . Can it be that we don &apos;t think about the same things ? If we think about life and think about life , and if we actually live , 
so if you ask the simple question of how happy people in California are . Are they not going to be the correct answer ? Are they going to get the right answer if 
they ask that question ? Do they think people in California are happier ? If they say , &quot; We live in Ohio , 
and what happened ? &quot; That if they talk about life in California , they think , think about the difference . Between California and other places , and that difference is , let &apos;s say , climate . 
Well , it turns out climate is not very important for climate to the living self . And it &apos;s not even very important . It &apos;s not even very important for the thoughtful self to decide how happy people are , 
but now , because the thoughtful self is responsible . Can you end up having some people ? At the end of the day , they could move to California , 
and it &apos;s kind of interesting . It &apos;s kind of interesting to track what happens to people . They go to California , hoping to be happier , and they &apos;re going to be happier . 
Well , their self that lives is not going to get happier . 
We know that , 
but one thing is going to happen . They &apos;re going to think they &apos;re happier . Because if you think about that , you &apos;re going to be reminded of it . Like , how terrible the weather in Ohio was . And you &apos;re going to feel you &apos;re making the right decision . 
It &apos;s very difficult to tell clearly about well @-@ being . And I hope I &apos;ve got you an idea of that . How difficult it is . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question . I want to ask you . 
Thank you very much . 
Well , when we started a couple of weeks ago telephoning , you told me that it was a pretty interesting result . It was from this Gallup survey that it came up with , 
is that something you &apos;re participating in ? Can you let us do it because you can now have a few minutes left . 
Daniel Kahneman : Surely . 
I think the most interesting result . The one we did in the Gallup survey . It &apos;s a number we have absolutely no number to find . 
We expected . We found that in terms of happiness in happiness for the survivor , even 
if we looked at how feelings were with income vary 
and it represents itself , it turns out , that under an income of 60,000 dollars in a year , for Americans . And that &apos;s a very big sample . Americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative . Under an income of 600,000 dollars , in the year , 
about 60,000 . 
DK : 60,000 , 
60,000 dollars , in the year , people are unhappy . And they &apos;re getting increasingly unhappy . The poorer they get about 
it , we get an absolutely flat line . 
I mean , I rarely have such flat lines . 
See what happens ? Is it obvious that money doesn &apos;t bring you experience happiness , but that lack of money certainly brings you misery , and we can get this misery very , very clearly . 
In the sense of the other , even the remembering self , you get a different story . 
The more money you make , the more satisfied you are . 
Isn &apos;t it for emotions ? 
CA : But Danny , throughout America &apos;s endeavor , it &apos;s about life . Freedom , the endeavor for happiness . 
When people find this finding seriously , I would mean it seems like it all looks upside down . To put everything we believe , to say , in terms of tax policy and so on . 
Are there any chances that politicians , that the country in general , has a finding like the seriousness ? And based on that , politics would do 
DK , you know , I think there &apos;s recognition . For the role of gambling research in politics , 
recognition is becoming . Slowly , in the United States , there &apos;s no question , but in the United Kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now . And in other countries , it &apos;s happening . It &apos;s 
people who are recognizing it . They &apos;re lucky enough to think about it . If you think about politics , 
it &apos;s going to take a while . And people are going to discuss whether you &apos;re going to explore experiential happiness . Or whether you &apos;re going to explore life assessment . So we need to really soon have this discussion . 
How to increase happiness is very much different . Depending on how you think and whether you think about the memory self , very different . Or whether you think about the living self . 
That &apos;s going to affect politics . I think in the years to come , 
in the United States , you &apos;re tightening on experience happiness of the population . 
Measuring that will , I think , be in the next one or two decades , part of national statistics . 
His CA : Well , it seems to me that this topic is going to , or should , at least be the most interesting political debate to follow . About the next few years . 
Thank you very much . For inventing the behavioral economy , 
thank you , Danny Kahneman . Today 
I &apos;m going to talk to you . About energy and climate 
and that &apos;s perhaps a surprise , because my full @-@ time job at the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds . It &apos;s about the things we invent and deliver that we need to do . It &apos;s about the poorest two billion , a better life . 
But energy and climate are extremely important . For these people , in fact , more important than for everyone . For others on the planet , 
climate degradation means that their seeds will not grow for many years . It &apos;s too much , or too little rain . Things will change that way . As your fragile environment . It &apos;s not sustainable . 
Can that lead ? To starvation , it leads to insecurity . It leads to unrest . 
So a climate change is getting terrible . For you 
, too , the energy price is for you . Very important . 
The fact is , if you &apos;re just talking about one thing , you could reduce the price , you &apos;d be reducing poverty . Energy by far the most effective , 
now the energy price is over time . 
In fact , the progress society is based on energy advances 
that drove coalmining evolution . Industrial revolution on and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid fall in the electricity price , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators . Climate change systems : We can make modern materials . And so many things we 
do : We &apos;re in a state of great situation . With electricity in the rich world , 
but if we pay the price down , we let ourselves pay half the price . Let &apos;s meet a new barrier and this barrier hangs with the CO2 , right ? 
CO2 warms the planet and the equation for CO2 is actually actually pretty clear . 
They sum up the CO2 emitted . Which one to increase temperature ? Which one leads to this increase , and this increase in temperature has some very negative consequences . Effects on the weather . And maybe worse , the indirect consequence is that natural ecosystems are so rapid changes that they don &apos;t adapt . Can and can , therefore , whole systems collapse ? Well 
, the exact connection between a CO2 increase and the resulting temperature change , and where they continue to follow . There are some ambiguities . But not very many . 
And there are certainly ambiguities about how bad this impact will be . But they will be extremely bad . 
I have the top scientists several times asked , &quot; Do we really have to get down to near zero ? 
&quot; &quot; Not enough . &quot; Half or one quarter , 
the answer is , until we get near zero . Will the temperature keep going ? Will it rise ? 
That &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge . 
It &apos;s very different . It &apos;s quite different than to say we have a 3.5 @-@ meter truck . It &apos;s below a three @-@ meter bridge . It has to be here , you can sort of undergo it . You squeeze 
this . This has to be downward to zero . 
Well , we hit zero every year . A lot of carbon dioxide . It &apos;s over 26 billion tons of carbon dioxide . 
Every American , about 20 tons . People from poor countries , less than one on average , 
it &apos;s about five tons . For everyone on the planet , 
and somehow we have to make changes . They who do that to zero , 
it &apos;s constant . Just increased , 
just different economic ones . Change has it affected at all . And we have to move from rapid growth to reduction . And to reduce to a zero reduction , 
this equation has . Four factors , a bit of multiplication . You have this thing on the left , CO2 . That you go to zero , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be done by the number of people . From the services that every human being on average uses . The average energy for every service and service and the CO2 per unit of energy is emitted . 
Let &apos;s therefore let &apos;s take every factor individually . And look at and think about how we can get this to zero . 
Probably , one of these numbers needs to be very close to zero . 
Now , this is basic algebra . But let &apos;s go through it . 
First of all , we have the population 
today . 6.8 billion people and 
it &apos;s screaming out at 9 billion . 
To those who are going to 9 billion when we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , new healthcare and reproductive medicine , could we do that ? Well , by 10 to 15 percent ? But at the moment , we &apos;re seeing a 1.3 percent rise , 
the second factor . Are the services we use ? 
Are the services we use ? That includes all the food we eat . Clothing , television , heating . 
These are very good things . And poverty reduction means these services almost to everyone on the planet . 
Accessible access to it . It &apos;s great . That this number goes up 
in the rich world , in the top billion . Could we possibly make cuts ? And use less , but on average , this number is going to rise every year . And so overall , it &apos;s more than doubling , the number of services per person provided per person . So 
here &apos;s a very basic service . Are there at home ? Light to make sure you read the homework . Can 
and can have , and these students don &apos;t have it . So they go out and read their homework . Under the street light , 
now , effectiveness , the E , the energy per service gives . It &apos;s good news at last . 
We have something that doesn &apos;t go up . 
Because of different successes in the lighting sector , because of other types of cars , because of new methods . In housing , there are many services whose energy use they dramatically reduce . Can they go down dramatically ? Can they go down ? 103.00 . 
05 : 50 . 000 . GT : 00 : 05 : 53 : 000 . Some services can be reduced by 90 % . Some individual services can be reduced by 90 % . 
Others can be reduced by 90 % by services such as fertilisers ( 105 : 00 - 05 ) . 56 : 000 GT : 00 - 05 : 58 000 or Air transport Or Air transport Is the margin for improvement ? A lot smaller . 
Overall , if we are optimistic , we may be reduced . To be a factor 3 , or maybe even a factor 6 . 
But with the first three factors , we are now 26 out of 26 billion , perhaps very best . 13 billion tons went . And that &apos;s just enough . Not enough . 
Let &apos;s look at the fourth factor . And this one will be a key factor . That &apos;s the amount of CO2 . That &apos;s emitted per unit of energy , 
it &apos;s going to be . It &apos;s asking itself whether you can do that to zero . 
If you burn coal , no , 
if you burn natural gas , no . 
Almost every method of making electricity . Today , emits CO2 , except renewable energy and nuclear energy , 
so what we &apos;re doing at a global level . Must be a new system to 
create ? We need energy under 
, if I &apos;m going to use the term &quot; miracle . &quot; I don &apos;t mean the impossible , 
the microprocessor . Is a miracle ? The PC is a miracle . 
The Internet and its services are a miracle 
, people here here have . To develop many of these miracles , 
usually there are no miracles deadline . That you have a miracle up to a certain date . 
Normally you &apos;re just standing beside it . And some come not . In 
this case , we have to give full gas . And a miracle in very short time . Get me . 
&quot; Well , I wondered , how can I really get this over ? 
Are there a natural illustration , a demonstration ? Those who want to give people the idea here ? &quot; 
I remembered last year . When I brought mosquitos , and I kind of liked that , 
people liked that idea . For them , really tangible . You know , there are people . They have mosquitos living 
for energy . I noticed this . 
I decided that this was releasing fireflies . My year &apos;s contribution to the environment here . Would be 
here ? So here are some natural fireflies . 
You &apos;ve assured me that they &apos;re not biting . In fact , they &apos;re probably not even going to leave the glass . 
Well , there &apos;s all kinds of game solutions like this , but they &apos;re not all very much of us . 
Do you need solutions , either one or more , that make an unimaginable scale ? And unimaginable reliability , and though it has many directions , in which people are looking for it . I really see only five , which are making these big demands . Can 
I have tides ? Geothermal fusion . And biofuels omitted . 
These may afford a moderate contribution , and if they do better than I expect , it would be great . But my key message here is that we have to be on all those five . And we can &apos;t do any of them . Because they intimidate us , because everybody has significant problems . 
Let &apos;s first look at burning fossil fuels . Fuel burning . From either coal or natural gas , 
what you have to do there seems . Maybe just . But that &apos;s it . Not you have to take all that CO2 . That after burning out of the chimney comes in . Pressure liquefaction and then somewhere else store . And hope it &apos;s there . 
There are some pilot projects that do that on a 60 / 80 level . But it &apos;s 100 to get it . It &apos;s going to be very difficult . And it &apos;s going to be an agreement on storing CO2 that &apos;s a big challenge . But the biggest problem here is the question of storage time . 
Who &apos;s going to do it ? 
Ensure . Who can guarantee something ? What literally many billions times bigger ? As any kind of waste you can get away from nuclear and other things , you know ? 
Can that be a lot of volume ? 
So that &apos;s a hard nut . 
Next , nuclear energy . 
It also has three big ones . Problems : The cost , especially in highly regulated countries , is high . The question of security is that you really feel that nothing goes wrong . Can , despite human cooperation , that fuel doesn &apos;t go for weapons ? 
And what do you do ? With the waste , 
because although it &apos;s not very big . Are there a lot of concerns ? People have to get good at that . 
184.00 , 10 , 20,000 GT , 00 
, 10 , 25,000 , three very difficult ones . Problems that might be solvable , so three very difficult problems . Maybe solvable problems , and where they can be worked on , therefore . 
The last three of the five I &apos;ve summarized , and 
these are renewable energy . Like you often call them , 
and also they have , although it &apos;s great . That they don &apos;t need fuel . They have some disadvantages . 
One is that energy density is the energy density that these technologies generate . Dramatically lower than that of power plants , 
which are low @-@ energy , you talk about many square kilometers , thousands of times . More space than a normal power plant . And 
also , these sources are interruptions . 
The sun doesn &apos;t shine all day long , it doesn &apos;t shine every day , and the same way , the wind blows . Not constantly . So you 
have to , if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , have a way to have the energy , even in times when it &apos;s not available . 
You get it here , so there are big price challenges , there are challenges in transmission , for example , when we say that the energy source is outside the country . Do you not need it ? Only technology . You also need to be able to deal with the risk . That the energy is from where it 
comes from , and there is the storage problem , 
and the dimension . To show you , I &apos;ve looked at all kinds of batteries that are made . Look at those for cars , computers . Mobile phones , flashlights for everything . And that &apos;s what I &apos;ve got with the amount of electronic energy that the world uses , compared to what I found . It turns out that all the batteries that we &apos;re now producing . Less than 10 minutes of total energy storage 
, we need here , so we need a big breakthrough . Something that , by a factor of 100 , will be better . So , as the approaches at the moment — 
that &apos;s not impossible . But it &apos;s not that easy . 
That happens when you try to try and spread these interrupted sources over , say , 20 , 30 percent of consumption . 
If you &apos;re 100 percent reliant on that , you need a tremendous wonder battery . 
Now , where are we going to go ? What is the right approach ? 
A Manhattan project : How do we get to the finish ? 
What we need is a lot of companies working on it , hundreds 
in each of these five areas . We need at least 100 people , 
many of whom will say they &apos;re crazy . That &apos;s good . 
I think here in TED , I think there are many people who are already engaged in this . 
Bill Gross has several companies , including one called Esolar , which is a great solar thermal technology . 
Vinod Khosla is investing . Dozens of companies that are doing great things and interesting opportunities , And I &apos;m trying to support that . 
Nathan Myhrvold and I are funding a company . They might surprisingly be financing the nuclear approach , 
there are some innovations in the nuclear field modular . Liquid , development has 
a lot to do in this industry some time ago . So it &apos;s not a big surprise . It &apos;s a lot of good concepts lying around , and that means 
the Terrapower concept . It &apos;s that instead of a part of the uranium , the one percent , the U235 , we decided to burn the 99 . The U238 , that 
&apos;s a pretty crazy thing . 
Idea , but actually , you had been thinking about it for a long time . But you could never simulate it sensibly . Whether it would work , but since it became modern supercomputers , you can simulate it . And you can see that , yes , with the right approach to matter , it looks like this . That it 
works , and because you can burn these 99 , the cost profile is much better . In fact , 
you burn the garbage , and you can even burn the garbage from today &apos;s reactors as 
a drive . Instead of getting your head broken over it , they just burn it . A great thing : 
Uranium is gradually becoming depleted . Is it a little bit like a candle ? 
You can see that it &apos;s a kind of column . It &apos;s often called a migratory wave , reactor 
, which really solves the fuel problem . 
Here &apos;s a picture of a place in Kentucky . 
This is the waste . The 99 , you have the part of the burned today . It &apos;s taken out , so it &apos;s called &quot; depleted uranium . 
&quot; That drives the U.S. to hundreds of hundreds of years . 
And if you buy ocean water cheap and easy to filter , you get enough fuel to get the rest . Life of the planet 
, you know , there &apos;s still a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example . Many hundreds of concepts that we &apos;ve got to use . To move forward , 
we &apos;re thinking about how to make our success measured 
. Should we , how should our testimony look ? 
Well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to achieve . And then we talk about the intermediate step . 
Many talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 . 
It &apos;s really , really important . That we get there , 
the remaining 20 percent are going to be produced in poor countries . Are going to be and are still going to be some agriculture ? Hopefully , forest threats and cement will be done by then . 
Clean , so to make this 80 percent happen . Do the developed world , including countries like China , have to completely change their generation of electricity ? The other 
note says , do we have zero emissions technology , whether they &apos;re in all developed countries , or whether they &apos;re in all developed countries ? And we , on the way , are you going to the rest . Getting 
that . That &apos;s great . Important . 
That &apos;s going to be a key element of this stuff . 
If we get back from there , how should that 2020 testimony look ? 
It should be back to the two elements . 
We should be using the effectiveness measures to reduce the way to getting there . The less we emit , the less we emit the CO2 will be . And so will the temperature , 
but actually , this note is for things that we do , the things that we don &apos;t do completely , that lead to the big reductions . Just equal , right ? Even something . Less important . Like the other . Which ones , speed ? Innovation ? For these breakthroughs ? 
Does this breakthroughs represent ? Do we have to track with full gas ? And that &apos;s what we can measure . In company numbers , in pilot projects and regulatory changes , 
there are lots of great books . So on this subject 
, Al Gore &apos;s book , we have the choice , and David McKay &apos;s Sustainable . Energy without the Hot Air : You 
&apos;re really going to do it . Through and through , you create a framework . In which this is widely discussed , because we need to do that , we need support . Of all sides , 
there are some things that come together . 
Does that have to be a wish ? 
A very concrete one . Wish that we have to invent this technology 
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years . I could give the president a choice : A vaccine , and I love that . Or I could choose that wish . That is half the energy price . Without CO2 , it &apos;s invented . That desire I would take . 
This one has the greatest impact 
if we didn &apos;t get that wish . Will the gap between the long term and the short term be thinking ? People will be horrible between the United States and China . Between the rich and poor countries and almost all of them live on these two . Billions will become much worse . 
What do we have to do ? 
Which measures do I appeal for ? 
We have to invest more research money . 
If countries are in places like Koppenhagen , countries should not meet just through CO2 , 
they should talk about it . They should discuss this innovation strategy . And they would be shocked . Of the ridiculously low money that is being spent on these innovative approaches . 
We need market incentives , carbon taxes . Cap &amp; amp ; Trade , something that sends a price signal : We 
need to spread the message . 
We need dialogue , more rational and complete . And so do the things that are being done by the government as well . 
It &apos;s an important wish , but I think we can fulfill it . 
Thank you very much . 
Thank you very much . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . Thank you . 
Thank you very much . Just to get Terrapower a little better . To understand , first of all , you can give us an idea of the scale of this investment . 
Bill Gates : To simulate on a supercomputer , all the big scientists . To get what we &apos;ve done , we just need a few 10 million , and even . If we can put our materials in a Russian reactor to test to make sure it &apos;s working properly . Is it just in the 100s ? Millions of 
the difficult step is building . The first reactor , another billion to find the regulariums and the place of the actual reactor , the first one to build . 
Once the first one is finished , when it runs as promised . Then everything is clear . Because the economic viability , the energy density , is so different . As with nuclear energy , as we know it , 
CA : To understand that correctly . That means deep into the ground . Almost like a vertical . Pillar of nuclear fuel , that used . Urans , and then the process begins . Up there , and continues to work . Down there . 
BG : Exactly today , you always have to refill the reactor . So there are lots of people and lots of controls that go wrong . Can this thing where you open it ? And things in there ? Or bring out ? This is not good . 
If you do , however , have very cheap fuel , you can refill it for 60 years . Think of a column that you bury . Without the whole complexities , 
and it sits there and burns . 60 years and then it &apos;s -- it &apos;s done . 
CA : A nuclear reactor . The self @-@ solution for the garbage is 
BG : Yeah , well , what about the garbage ? You can sit it . Let &apos;s have it much less garbage . With this method , then take it and pack it . In the next reactor , burn it further . 
And we start by putting the garbage away . The one that already exists in these cooling basins or dry tanks at the reactors . That &apos;s our starting fuel . 
So that &apos;s what kind of reactors are facing . What we &apos;re doing in our fill fill , and that &apos;s dramatically reducing the volume of garbage . Reducing the volume of waste during this process , 
about , but while you &apos;re talking to different people around the world about these possibilities . 
Where is that biggest ? Interest , such a thing . Realization . 
BG : Well , we haven &apos;t got to a place yet , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting . Disclosure rules for everything that nuclear is wearing in the name , there &apos;s a lot of interest , and the people of the company were in Russia , India . China : I was here and I have met the energy minister . And I &apos;ve talked about how this fits into the energy agenda . 
I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the French and the Japanese have something in the direction . 
This is a variant . One thing that was done . 
Was this a major step ? Forward , but it &apos;s like a quick one . Reactor and some countries have built these , so everybody who &apos;s building a fast reactor is there . Has a candidature for our first CA in their imagination 
, timeframe ? And probability , this is really something like this . It &apos;s a way to start life . 
BG : Well , we need one of these scalable . Power generating things that are very cheap . We have 20 years to invent . And then 20 years to deploy , 
which is kind of the deadline that the environmental models show us . We keep to those , 
and you know , Terrapower , if everything goes well . And that &apos;s a big wish . Could that keep 
it easy ? And fortunately , there are dozens of companies and we need dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds that work the same way when their approaches work . Promoting support for their pilots works for that , can offer it , 
and it would be best if several could do it , because then you could use a mix , definitely you need . 
We need a solution . 
CA : With regard to the big possible breakthroughs , this is the biggest one . That you know . 
BG : An energy break is the most important one . 
That would be it . Without the environmental challenge . But the power still is . So much more important 
in the nuclear sector . Are there other innovative companies 
? You know , we know their work not so well as these ? But there are the modular methods , which is another approach . 
There is a liquid reactor type that is a little difficult . But maybe the ones who say that about us , 
and so there are different , but the beauty of that is that a uranium molecule is a million times as much energy . It &apos;s like saying a carbon molecule , and that &apos;s why , if you can deal with the problems , and they &apos;re mainly radiation . The footprint and the cost is playing that . So potential , the impact on the countryside . And other things , almost . In a league of its own , 
CA : If that doesn &apos;t work , what ? 
Then we have to take emergency action . To try and get the Earth temperature stable , 
BG : If you &apos;re in this situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;re too eaten too much . And just before a heart attack , what do you do ? You might need a heart surgery or something like that . 
There &apos;s a research that &apos;s going on called geoengineering . It &apos;s going to look at different techniques to get warming delayed . So that we can take 20 or 30 years longer to get together 
, which is just an insurance method . 
You hope that we don &apos;t need that . 
Some people say you should not even start at the insurance company , right ? Because you might be lazy . So you eat more , because you know you &apos;re going to save you from heart surgery . 
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart . If you look at the importance of this problem , but you look at it , there &apos;s a discourse in geoengineering . Whether you &apos;re going to have that at your disposal . If the things get faster . Or this innovation ? It takes longer than we expect . 
About climate skeptics , do you have one or two sentences for those to maybe convince you ? 
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps . 
Those who have scientific arguments are very little . 
Tell them it &apos;s negative effects . Those with clouds to do with have the things moving 
. There are very , very few things that they say at all . Of those , there &apos;s a chance in a million , 
the main problem here is so similar . As with AIDS , 
you make the mistake . Now , and you pay a lot for it . Later , 
and that &apos;s why the idea is , now , if you have all sorts of urgent problems . In something to invest from that you &apos;re only going to have later , and that comes on top of that . That the investment isn &apos;t so clear . In fact , the IPCC Report isn &apos;t necessarily the worst scenario . And there are people in the rich world . They are looking at IPCC and saying , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s not a big one . Drama , 
the fact is that this uncertainty worries us . But should 
my dream be here , if you want to do it economically and at the same time eliminate CO2 ? &quot; Then they also say , &quot; Okay . &quot; It interests me not . It doesn &apos;t matter that it emits CO2 . I almost wish it did , but I &apos;m probably going to accept it . Because it &apos;s cheaper . When the previous method is about 
, and that would be your answer to Björn . Lomborg &apos;s argument that if you were to spend all of this time and energy on the CO2 problem , you would have to solve it . All the other goals are suffering , the poverty reduction , the fight against malaria , and so on . That it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources . Money to invest in it , while it &apos;s better things . We do that . 
BG : Well , the actual spending on research can tell you . We , the U.S. , should be spending 10 billion more per year . When you do that today , that &apos;s not so dramatic . 
It should be other things that should not suffer . 
You come to big amounts of money . And here , sensible people can disagree . If you have something that &apos;s not economically sound and you try to fund it . For me , this is where most waste happens . It &apos;s 
unless you &apos;re very short . Before a cost breakthrough , you only fund the learning curve . I think we should do more . Those who have the potential , very much cheaper . 
Being in case the swab you &apos;re getting is a very high energy price . Then only the rich can keep up . 
I mean , each of us here could do five times as much for our energy , right ? Without his lifestyle changing 
, for those who have the bottom two billion , 
but is it a disaster ? And even Lomborg thinks about 
his new mesh , &quot; Why is it that research isn &apos;t going to be discussed anymore ? &quot; 
He &apos;s still being discussed because of his earlier stories with the skeptic camp . But he understood that this is one very lonely group , and he &apos;s been talking about it . 
And so he &apos;s now bringing the research argument , and this is a thought . 
I &apos;m suggesting that &apos;s appropriate : Research . It &apos;s just crazy . How little does it support ? CA 
: Bill , I think I &apos;m talking for almost all the people here . If I say , &quot; I really hope that your desire will come true . &quot; Thank you very much . 
BG : Thank you . 
I would like to tell you something . What I wanted to tell you a few months ago when I wrote an article for Italian . Wired noticed , 
I noticed when I was writing , that I always got my synonymous dictionary ready for use . But I was with editing the dictionary . I was done already , and I noticed that I &apos;ve never been in my life looking at it . What the word hinders really means , &quot; I 
read you the entry , disabled . 
&quot; &quot; Adjective curved , helpless , useless . &quot; Destroyed . Deceased . Mutilated . Wounded . Mastered . Cham . Separated . Keep it away . Determined . Weakened . Impotent . Castriert . Paralyzed . @ Gehandicapt. @ senil @ weak age @ out of circulation @ pulled @ improved @ done @ broken @ borrowed @ counted ( See also injured ) @ useless And @ weak @ 
Anonyme healthy , @ strong @ efficient 
I have this list with a friend read out loud And I had to laugh first . It worked so ridiculous . But I just came up and prepared and couldn &apos;t speak any more and had to stop . Read and read and collect me first . After this invincible flood of words and the emotional shock that it 
caused , of course . That was a fractured old synonym dictionary . I just thought I &apos;d just run out of the box that had 
to be pretty old . But actually , it was an issue on the early &apos; 80s . When I was just in primary school , and I started doing that , my self @-@ image . Outside my family environment , and building and shaping it . Also in terms of other kids and other kids and the rest of the world around me . 
And God thank you . Have I no synonymous dictionary at that time ? Would 
I use this entry seriously ? Take it seriously . Would I have been born into a world ? Anyone like me , as a person , would perceive their lives in no way positive in any way . Can today , however , I become a champion of the opportunities and adventures I &apos;ve experienced ? So 
I celebrated myself immediately , the online edition of 2009 , and I started to call myself . And I expected that I could have a more appealing contribution here . 
Here &apos;s the updated version of this entry . 
Unfortunately , it &apos;s not much . 
Better , especially , the last two words shake me . Under Near Anonyms , whole and healthy , but it &apos;s not just about words 
, it &apos;s about what we &apos;re talking about about people , 
it &apos;s about what we think about people . The ones we use to describe with these words , 
it &apos;s about values . The ones in these words are , and how we construct these values , affects 
our language . Our thinking and how we design the world and people around us , our thinking . 
Many ancient societies , including Greeks , and Greeks and Romans , have . Really believed . That the debate of a curse is a great force . Because what you say loud is that what you can manifest itself . 
So what do we want ? Actually manifest . You have a disabled person . People or a powerful person . People alone , 
already a human being . Careless as a child . Could they be enough to limit it ? And to impose ideas on them ? Would 
it not be more beautiful to them ? Doors to open . 
A human being . Who for me opens doors was the one who was my pediatrician . AM : A.I. DuPont Institute in Wilmington , Delaware . 
It &apos;s Dr. Pizzutillo , an Italo @-@ American whose name is like you think . Can most Americans not be correct ? They could say , &quot; So he was always called Dr. P. 
&quot; And Dr. P. always wore very colorful . Flies and was for work with the kids . Simple , made . 
I found the time I spent working with this hospital . Simply great . Except for my physiotherapy , 
I had to do some exercises , seemingly infinitely often . With these thick elastic bands in different colors , you know , around my leg muscles , you know . And I have these bands hated more . When everything else , I hated them , I hated them , I cursed them . I have hated them . 
And imagine if you can imagine I even have been five years old with Dr. P. P. negotiating with Dr. P. And so this is how I try to stop these exercises . Natural , without success . 
And one day he &apos;s got me at one of my exercises . These exercises were just tiring . And mercilessly , and he said to me , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful . And young girl , you &apos;re going to be one day tearing one of these tapes , 
and if you can do it , I &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot; 
That was , of course , just a simple trick . Dr. P. : So I could do the exercises I don &apos;t do . I wanted to do the view that the richest five @-@ year @-@ old girl in the hospital would be on the second floor . But he got me actually to do my daily exercise horror with new eyes , to see . So it turned into a new and promising experience . 
And I wonder today how much I &apos;m wondering about his vision . As a strong and powerful young girl , my self @-@ image has shaped and I imagine myself like this , as one of nature &apos;s strong , powerful and atlethic people . To see , 
this is just one example . Of many , like adults in power positions . Imagination of a child can stimulate , but how that can stimulate 
, as the examples already cited from the synonymous dictionaries prove , our language doesn &apos;t allow us any space to imagine something . What we all want would be it for each and every one of us to do . To make ourselves powerful people , to see 
our language lags behind . To make social changes . The changes that are often caused by technological change have been triggered by medical considerations 
, from a medical point of view . You can say , of course , that my legs , laser surgery for visually impaired , knee joints made of titanium and artificial hip joints . For aging bodies that make it possible for people to really all their possibilities . And to get beyond the limits that their natural destiny sets them . Beyond that , Not at all to talk . Not to talk about social networking platforms . People allow themselves to give their own identity . Give themselves in their own way , define themselves , 
and thereby adapt to groups around the world . They who make their own choices , 
so maybe this technological change is a clear illustration . Clearer than ever , that it &apos;s always been a different truth , which is that every person in society has something very special and very powerful giving . Can and can and can be the human ability to adapt , our greatest plus ? 
Human ability to adapt , that &apos;s a really interesting story . Because people always keep asking me to ask me to tell . How do I deal with adversity , and I &apos;m going to confess something to you , this sentence has . For me , never fit , and I &apos;ve always been very uncomfortable . I &apos;ve felt the questions of people about answering them . And I think , gradually , I understand why . 
This sentence about how to deal with adversity . Lives on the idea that success or happiness comes from it . A challenge to master . Without the one that comes with it , it &apos;s a challenge to be shaped . As if my life is so successful , because I &apos;ve been able to traps in a life with a prosthetic prosthesis . Could or , whatever , people could , with my disability , 
perceive me ? But the truth is that we are changing , of course . We are from the challenge , whether they &apos;re physical , emotional or even both . 
And I &apos;m saying that &apos;s good . 
Distastements are not an obstacle . That we need to curve to work with our lives better , to make 
it clear . Diversity is just part of it . Our lives 
and I tend to be adversity as my shadow . To see 
sometimes I realize that it &apos;s very present . Sometimes it &apos;s hardly visible . But it &apos;s constantly with me . 
And I want to make absolutely no sense of the impact or severity of a human being &apos;s struggle . 
There are in life adversity and challenges and the challenges are only too universal . Real and every person goes with it . Different , but the question is not whether we can deal with adversity clearly or not , right ? But how do we deal with it ? 
Well , we &apos;re not just responsible for that . People who we love before blows of fate save us from . They &apos;re also prepared to do it well , 
well , clear . So to come and we show our kids . No favor if we give them the feeling that they feel they &apos;re not adapting . Can you 
? You have to separate two things clearly . One is medical fact : Amputated . And one is medical fact . And the other is social opinion about whether I &apos;m disabled . 
Or not . And to be honest , the only real and lasting disability is with the one I have to deal with . It &apos;s that the world is constantly saying . It can connect me with these definitions . 
In our desire to make people protected , the people who care about us . And to give them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis . Or even a prognosis about quality of life . To make the one that expects them , we have to be careful not to lay the foundation for somebody actually being disabled . 
Maybe that &apos;s the current concept . That &apos;s just looking at what &apos;s broken in a broken . And how we fix that for everybody , a bigger disability for everyone than pathology . In itself , 
if we don &apos;t holistically treat a human being and not all of his forces . And perceive opportunities and recognize them . Let &apos;s create , in addition to the natural struggle . You might be forced to lead another disease , 
we degrade . One person who is for our society a value , 
so we have to talk about patology beyond patology . And look at all areas of human potential , 
at the very least , but most importantly , it &apos;s that there &apos;s a gap between perception of our inadequacies and our great inventive spirit . 
We should be able to connect these challenging times . Not devalue . Or deny . We should not try to avoid them . We should not try to rug them under the carpet . It &apos;s about putting them in the odds . 
It &apos;s about recognizing opportunities . It &apos;s probably about making it clear to me . It &apos;s not necessarily that we have to overcome adversity . It &apos;s that we are open to it . It &apos;s embracing it . It &apos;s hugging it . It &apos;s just to put a fight expression in there , and maybe even dance with it . 
And maybe we can do it . It &apos;s to give adversity as something natural , coherent and useful . And it &apos;s to make us feel like this . It &apos;s not your presence . It &apos;s more so burdened . It &apos;s 
this year that we celebrate the 200 . Birthday of Charles . Darwin and when he was 150 years ago about evolution , he wrote about evolution , Darwin , in my eyes , has something very true in human character . 
I would point out it that way , not the strongest of its kind survives . And neither does it . The smartest of its kind , but the one that best survives changes . Can 
conflict arise ? Creativity , not . 
Only Darwin &apos;s work we know that the ability of man to become a survivor and thrive is dependent on the struggle of the human mind . It &apos;s determined by conflict to change . 
So change and adaptation are the changes that are the greatest abilities . 
Man &apos;s ability , and maybe we know only from what wood we &apos;re carved from . If we really are tested , 
maybe it &apos;s that that sense . It &apos;s from adversity , it &apos;s perception . It &apos;s ego &apos;s feeling , it &apos;s feeling our own power . 
We can feel ourselves something like that . 
We can give adversity a new meaning . It &apos;s about beyond difficult times , 
maybe we can treat adversity as change . 
Adversity stands for change . To which we are not yet adapted , 
I think the adversity is the greatest damage we have done to ourselves . Having is to believe . 
That we are supposed to be normal . Let &apos;s be honest . Who is normal ? 
There is no normal . 
There is the usual , the typical , but not the normal , and would you like to have this poor , gray person ? Really ? Get to know if it really wants 
you . I think it &apos;s not . 
It would be great . If we wanted to know this pattern of normality against another of the possibilities or the strength . To even do it a little more dangerous , exchange it , exchange it . So we can exchange the forces of very many children . And to invite them to release their very special and valuable abilities into society , Anthropolgy 
has found out . That we humans are members of our society , always demanding one thing . Useful to be . And contributing to making it . 
There are indications that there are already Neanderthals who , 60 000 years ago , older people and people with severe physical injuries , were carrying with them . And that might have happened because life experience in the struggle for survival of these people is valuable to society . 
You have these people not broken as broken and useless . You &apos;ve been seen as something special . And valuable , treated 
a few years ago . I went to the city . I went up in the city where I grew up , to a food market in that Red Zone . In the northeast of Pennsylvania , and I stood there in front of a bushel . Tomatoes . 
It was summer , and I had shorts on , and 
I hear a guy behind me listening . Says , &quot; Well , if that &apos;s not Aimee Mullins , 
and I turn around and see this older man , I didn &apos;t know . &quot; Who he is , 
and I said , &quot; Excuse me . &quot; Sir , do we know ? I can &apos;t get to remember you , and 
he said , &quot; Well , you &apos;re unlikely to be . &quot; Remember me when 
I turned you to the first time . Have I got you out ? Dust of your mother &apos;s belly . Get 
it . Oh . 
So , the , and of course it &apos;s done , but click . 
That was Dr. Kean , a man . I just got this from my mother &apos;s stories about this day . Because of course , I &apos;m typical of my birthday , two weeks late . 
Did the doctor come for prenatal diagnostics from my mother , on vacation ? And so my parents knew the man , the man who gave me birth . Not at all . 
And because I was born without a calf &apos;s legs , and my feet were directed towards them . And I had only a few toes . On this one and a few toes on the other foot was he who had the handler of that stranger , had to bring the bad news . 
He said to me , &quot; I had to tell your parents . You never walk . And never walk that mobile . &quot; He would be like other kids , or you would never be an independent life . You could , and they &apos;ve just lied to me since then . Really 
punished . Exceptional , I found that he had newspaper clips collected from all of my childhood . Whether I was in a letter contest in the second grade , whether I had won . Whether I was with the scout scouts at the Halloween Parade on Halloween , whether I was traveling my scholarship or a scholarship or one of my sporting victories . And he used these clips to make his students teach . Medical students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School , 
and he called this part of his course . The X factor , the potential . The human will . 
You can &apos;t do enough to stress how crucial this factor is . For quality of life of a human being , 
and Dr. Kean continued . He said , &quot; I learned that when children don &apos;t keep doing something else , they get to say something else , and even if they get a little bit of support . If you have kids left to themselves , then children can have a lot to do . Look 
, Dr. Kean . Has his thinking changed 
? He had understood . That the medical diagnosis and how someone could handle it , 
two different things . And I too have my thinking in the course of time changed . If you can tell me at the age of 15 , if I had my prostheses against legs from meat and meat and bone . Would that have meant I wouldn &apos;t have hesitated for a second ? 
I wanted to be normal at the time . 
If you would have asked me that today , I &apos;m not so sure . 
And that &apos;s what happened . Because I have something to do with my legs . And not despite these experiences , and maybe this change could have happened . 
Because I &apos;ve had so many people . Am I the door open ? Have people instead of the people ? Who restrict me or give me an idea of being mutilated ? See 
, it needs . Really ? Just one person who demonstrates to you how you can manifest your forces . And you &apos;re through when 
you do it to someone who allows them to create their own inner forces . The human mind is so receptive . If you do that and for someone in a critical moment , a door opens . Then you &apos;re for these people a very good teacher . 
You bring them with you doors to themselves to 
open . The real meaning of the word educate is rooted in the word educe , 
it means creating something . That in one is the potential to tickle out . Again 
, what potential do we want to retrieve now ? 
In the &apos; 60s , Britain became a case study . Back then , high schools were transformed into total schools . They call that there . 
Streaming trials in the United States , we call that tracking , the students are 
going to be . After grades , they &apos;re divided up , and 
the A students are being orally tested harder . If the better teachers get , etc . 
, they have a three @-@ month period . Students with a sufficient grade , very good given . It was told them they were aces . That they were very smart . And after those three months , they really have written one . 
And of course , it breaks your heart . Hearing you that the other way around , the one @-@ serer students were told . They were just enough . And 
the same was the case after the three months . But only 
those who always have to go to school , still . Apart from the students who have to miss the 
school , what &apos;s really important is that they should . And this study 
showed that teachers were not inaugurated . Teachers knew not that something changed . 
They just were told that they were the Einser students , and that they were the students with the grade enough , and they were the same . They gave them some 
lessons , and they treated the only real disability . Is a broken mind ? A spirit that broke . Was not hopeless ? More . He finds nothing . More beautiful . He lacks our natural childlike . Curiosity . And our innate ability to imagination , 
if we do , but we can do it , to help the human mind . Continue hoping to self @-@ hope and other people to be around . Beautiful to find . Curious and imaginative to be , then we put our forces . Really ? Positive 
if a mind is about these qualities , it &apos;s possible to create a new reality and new forms of existence . 
I want to start with a poem . This is from a Persian poet named Hafiz in the 14th century . It was written by me and my friend Jacques Dembois told me . And the poem is called &quot; The God Who Was Only Four Words . &quot; Every child knows God , not the God . The name , not . The God of Prohibitions , but the God . The only four words know , and these are repeated all the time , he says , &quot; Only 
come dance . &quot; With me , come dance . With me , thank you very much . .
