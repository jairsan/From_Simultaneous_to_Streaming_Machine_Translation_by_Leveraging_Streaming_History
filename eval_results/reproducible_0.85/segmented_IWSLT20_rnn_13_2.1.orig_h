Before a few years ago here at TED , Peter Skillman presented a design competition called &quot; The Marshmallow Challenge . &quot;
The idea is pretty simple .
Four teams have to get the widest possible freestanding structure with 20 spaghetti .
CA : 1m tape .
CA : 1m thread and a marshmallow build , the marshmallow has to go up there .
And though it really is easy , it &apos;s actually right , really hard .
Because it &apos;s pushing people very fast to work together .
And so , I thought this was a really interesting idea .
And I have it in a way that I turned into a design workshop .
It was a huge success .
It &apos;s been a success since then , I &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world with students , developers and architects , even CTOs , the Fortune 50 companies .
And there &apos;s something about this stuff to do .
What depth of impressions into nature is about the collaboration .
And I want to share some of these with you .
Normally , the majority of people start themselves with regard to the task of orienting themselves .
They talk about it .
They think about how it will look .
They &apos;re hanging around power .
Then they invest in a little time in planning and organization .
They sketch and lay spaghetti out of it .
They invest in a lot of their time in assembling .
They invest in constantly growing structures .
And finally , just before they don &apos;t have time anymore , somebody takes the Marshmallow .
And they put it gently on top of the top .
They take a step back and admire TA @-@ da .
What , then , almost always happens is that this TA @-@ da becomes an UH @-@ Oh , because the weight of the marshmallow causes the whole thing to bend , and collapse .
It &apos;s a series of people there who have a lot more UH @-@ Oh moments than others .
And under the worst are freshness . BWL graduates .
They lie , they cheat .
They &apos;re confused and they really produce very poor shapes .
And of course , there are teams that have a lot more TA @-@ DA formations .
And under the best are freshness . Graduates of the kindergarten .
And that &apos;s pretty amazing .
How we have Peter told us , they not only produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
What they might ask you is , how does this come about ?
Why ?
What is the point of those ?
And Peter tells no one of the kids , &quot; Is time investing ? &quot;
In it , head of Spaghetti GmbH , he says .
She invests no time in power struggles .
It &apos;s there , however , another reason .
And that is that BWL students were trained , who had a real plan to find .
OK .
And he was then realized what he was going to do .
If you were to put the Marshmallow at the top , you don &apos;t have time anymore .
And what happens ?
It &apos;s a crisis .
Sounds familiar .
What ? What else do kindergarten kids do is they do with the Marshmallow and prototypes , and they build it .
Successful prototypes , always with the Marshmallow at the top , so that they have multiple times the opportunity to build dilapidated prototypes to repair .
Constructors recognize these kinds of collaboration , as the core of an iterative process .
And with each attempt , the attempt is made to get the kids immediately feedback .
What works ?
And what doesn &apos;t work ?
So this is the performance with prototypes to work .
It &apos;s essential , but let &apos;s see how different teams operate .
The average for the majority is that for most , they &apos;re about 50 centimeters of BWL students to do .
The half of them , lawyers , a little bit more .
But not much kindergarten kids are better than the adults .
Who is at the most successful architect and engineer ?
To be lucky .
1M is that highest .
What I saw is what I saw and why .
Because they have triangles to understand and self @-@ reinforcing geometric patterns .
The key to stable structures is to build CEOs , something is above average .
But here &apos;s where it gets interesting .
Set it in an executive administrator .
Put it on the team , they get significantly better .
It &apos;s incredible .
It &apos;s incredible . You look around and you see this team will win .
You can do that .
Why is this going ?
Because you have special skills in process monitoring .
You run the process .
You understand it and that team , you know .
That &apos;s what regulates and works on .
You pay attention to the performance of the team , and it &apos;s going to significantly improve .
Specialized skills and process skills and their combination will lead to success .
If you &apos;re 10 teams that have typical procedures , you get .
CA : 6 .
The stable structures have , I tried , well , something exciting .
I thought , let &apos;s bring the poker bet in the same way .
So , I offered a $ 10,000 prize of software for the winners .
What do you think ?
Did it happen to these design students ?
What was that ?
Result : This was not happening . A team had a stable structure .
If anyone had a two @-@ inch @-@ tall construction , they would have built the prize home , and they would have paid it home .
Is it , then , not interesting that high betting bets have a strong effect ?
We repeated these exercises with the same students .
What do you think happened ?
Well , now you understood the advantage of prototyping .
So this is how the same bad team , one of the best , got out of the same bad team .
You made the highest construction in the world , in the least time .
It &apos;s like , there are profound lessons for us about nature of propulsion and success , and that &apos;s what we have .
You may ask why would someone else actually have to invest time ?
A Marshmallow Challenge to create .
The reason is , I help .
Digital tools and processes create to create teams to help .
Cars , video games and visual effects to create .
And what the Marshmallow Challenge does is it helps them create hidden assumptions . Because it helps them identify hidden assumptions , because frankly , every project has its own Marshmallow .
The challenge is to share a shared experience , a common language or attitude , the right prototype to build .
And this is the value of this experience .
This experience , so simple exercise , and those of you who are interested in it , can be MarshmallowChallenge .
COM : Visit .
It &apos;s a blog where you can see how to make the Marshmallows , right ?
It &apos;s a step @-@ by @-@ step guide there .
It &apos;s a crazy example from all over the world of people building the system to optimize and refining it .
It &apos;s also world records .
And the basals lesson , I think , is the construction , actually , a connecting one .
Sport is it . It requires that we all have our senses on the task and we have to focus our thinking optimally on how we use our emotions and our actions in the challenge , the challenge that lies ahead of us .
And sometimes it &apos;s a small prototype .
This experience , everything it takes ,
All it takes us from an UH @-@ Oh to a TA @-@ DA moment .
And that can make a big difference .
Thank you very much .
Do we do it as if we have a machine here ?
One big machine .
One cool TED @-@ like machine .
And that &apos;s a time machine .
And everybody in this room has to enter .
And they can enter into the past .
They can go into the future .
They can &apos;t go into the here .
And now they stay .
And I ask myself , what do you choose because I &apos;m thinking about my friends last time , a lot ?
These questions were asked , and they wanted all of you to go into the past .
I know not .
They wanted to go into time . They wanted to go back to the time before cars were there .
Or Twitter or America is looking for the superstar .
I know not .
I &apos;m convinced that you somehow want to nostalgia for wishful thinking , to nostalgia .
And that &apos;s what I understand .
I &apos;m not part of this group , I have to say .
I want not to be in the past .
And that &apos;s not because I &apos;m an adventurer .
It &apos;s because it &apos;s because opportunities on this planet are not going back .
They &apos;re going forward .
I want to go into this machine .
And I want to go into the future .
This is the greatest time , the greatest time it ever has on this planet .
No matter what scale you &apos;re applying .
Health , wealth .
Mobility .
Opportunities .
Declining rates of disease .
It was never before that time , like this .
My great grandparents all died when they were 60 .
My grandparents urged these numbers to push 70 .
My parents are the 80 to 80 . On the heels .
There should be better a nine @-@ on @-@ the @-@ beginning of my death .
But it &apos;s not even a question of people like us .
Because this is a bigger thing .
It &apos;s a child than a child who &apos;s born today in New Delhi can expect .
So long as you live as long as the richest man on earth .
Before 100 years ago , you think about it .
That &apos;s a tremendous fact .
And why is that so ?
The smallpox , smallpox , has billions of people on this planet killed .
They have the demographics of the Earth on a way to reinvent the world .
How it &apos;s not war ?
JE managed to do it . They &apos;re gone .
They &apos;re gone .
We &apos;ve got them defeated .
Puff in the rich world exist . Diseases that millions of millions of us have just one generation ago threatened , just in the world .
Hardly ever diphtheria is rubbing , polio knows anything .
Still , someone else , what that is ? Vaccines .
Modern medicine .
Our ability to treat billions of people .
That &apos;s successes of the scientific method and from my point of view , it &apos;s :
The scientific method : To try things out , see if it works .
It changes .
If it does not , a person who &apos;s one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
That &apos;s what the good news is .
Unfortunately , that &apos;s already the whole good news .
Because it &apos;s a couple of other problems .
And they &apos;ve been mentioned many times , and one .
Of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people on this planet , every day , hungry to bed .
These numbers are rising , and they &apos;re rising very quickly .
And that &apos;s embarrassing .
And not only that .
We have our imagination .
We &apos;ve used this to make this world thoroughly devastated : Drinking water , primal land .
Rainforest , oil , gas .
They disappear .
And that soon .
And if we look at it , not out of this chaos , we disappear , too . The question is :
So can we do that ?
I think we can .
I think so . I think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food .
The billions of people who feed without that land on the land where they live , without rape .
I think we can do this world with energy , that we can &apos;t provide for it at the same time .
I think that &apos;s really what it is .
And no .
That &apos;s not wishful thinking .
But that &apos;s what keeps me at night awake .
One of the things that keeps me awake at night .
We have scientific progress yet to date , so much needed as we have never before .
And we &apos;ve also been unprecedented . We &apos;ve never been able to use it sensibly .
So , just as we can do today .
We are at the threshold of the amazing , amazing events on many areas .
And yet , I really think that we have hundreds of 300 years before the Enlightenment , back to go back to a time to find a time .
In the time we fight progress , in the time we talked about these things more violently , we fought for them .
On more fronts than we do now .
The people cover themselves in their pockets of faith , and that &apos;s so narrow that they &apos;re not free .
They &apos;re not even free .
The truth is it &apos;s going to liberate them and hear them .
Everybody has a right to their right to opinion .
Even a right to their opinion .
But you know what they &apos;re not entitled to ?
Have you got no right to have your own facts , to blame .
Have you not ?
And I have a while taken . To do that , to figure out about a decade ago , I published an article about immunization for The New Yorker , a little article .
And I was amazed at resistance to resistance . I was amazed to encounter resistance to what ended up being the most effective measure .
In the health care sector , in the history of humanity .
I knew not what I was doing to do .
So I did just what I was always doing .
I wrote a paper and I drove on .
And soon thereafter , I wrote an article about genetically modified organisms .
Food that was the same thing , just bigger .
The people played crazy .
So I got mad about it as well .
And I could not understand why I was able to think .
That would be Frankenfood .
Why ?
They believed that molecules were going to be a particular molecule , rather than a random way of moving around , an attack on the territory of nature .
But you know , I &apos;m doing what I &apos;m doing .
I wrote the article .
I did it .
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist .
We type .
We pass on .
We go eat .
We go eat . That &apos;s okay .
But this article did make me worry .
And I could not figure out .
Why ?
And finally , I found out .
And that &apos;s because it &apos;s because these fanatics who mad me , they even didn &apos;t even be fanatics .
That was prudent people , educated people , decent people .
People , they were just like the people in this room , right ?
And that brought me that mess up .
But then I thought , &quot; You know what ?
Be us honest .
We are at a point where we &apos;ve reached a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress .
How we used to do it ?
We talk in two ways .
We talk in ironic terms about it with small quotes .
That &apos;s why progress is .
Okay .
That &apos;s what there are reasons for .
And I think we know what we need to do .
We have that trust in institutions . We have that trust in authority .
And sometimes in institutions , in science itself , we have lost .
And it &apos;s not a reason why that &apos;s not so .
You can just do a few names .
And the people are going to understand Chernobyl , Bhopal , Challenger , Vioxx , weapons of mass destruction .
The US presidential election in 2000 .
I mean , you know , you can have your own list .
It &apos;s got questions and problems with the people of which people we thought we were going to be right .
Be right , so be skeptical .
Imagine if you ask questions , &quot; Do you demand evidence ? &quot;
&quot; Do you demand evidence ? &quot;
Take the matter of the given , nothing but given .
But now it &apos;s when you get evidence , you have to get that evidence .
And in it we &apos;re not good .
And I can do that from the point of view that we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear , right ?
How I can tell you , never have seen you .
And hopefully never again see you . About about 12 years ago , it was .
It was published a story .
It was a terrible story that the Autism epidemic with the measles , mumps and rubells , vaccine , linked .
Very scary .
It was a bit of a trial that was done to see if that was true , and it was a bit of a haufenwise .
Studies were supposed to be done .
That &apos;s a serious matter .
The data came in .
The data came in . It came in from the United States .
England , Sweden , Canada .
And they were all the same . No correlation .
No connection at all . No connection .
It makes no difference .
It makes no difference .
Because we &apos;re anecdotes , we believe .
We believe what we see , what we see to see , what we believe to see .
What does it mean that we really feel ?
We believe not in a bundle of documents from a government clerk who tells us data .
And I understand that .
I think that &apos;s what we all do .
But you know what ?
That &apos;s the result of that was catastrophic , catastrophic .
Because of that fact , the United States is one of the only countries in the world .
In that country , the vaccine rate for measles is falling .
That &apos;s scandalous .
And we should be ashamed .
It &apos;s terrible .
What is happening is that we &apos;re doing that ?
Well , I understand that .
That &apos;s what I do .
Because has this somebody here ? Measles has one in the audience .
The somebody there who dies of measles happens not very often , it happens .
In this country , not at all .
But 160 000 times , 160 000 times in the world .
In the last year , these are many deaths from measles , 20 per hour .
But because that &apos;s not happening here , it &apos;s not happening here .
Can we do it out of place ?
And people like Jenny McCarthy can do things and they can walk around and they can get messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like Oprah and Larry King preach live .
And that can be done because they can cause and correlation , not connect .
They understand not that these things are the same to be the same .
But almost never , the same are .
And that &apos;s something that we &apos;re learning to learn .
And that &apos;s very fast .
This guy was a hero .
Jonas Salk : He liberated us from a guy of the worst scourges in humanity .
No fear , no torment , polio .
Puff disappeared .
The guy in the middle .
Not so much .
He &apos;s called .
Paul Offit : He just got with a couple of other people a rotavirus vaccine .
He can use life to 400 lives , 500,000 children per person a year in developing countries to save them .
Pretty good .
Not . Well .
That &apos;s good .
Apart from the fact that Paul is walking around talking about vaccines and saying , &quot; How valuable ? &quot;
They &apos;re and that the people are just stopping , right ?
They &apos;re complaining , and he says that , in fact .
Paul is , therefore , a terrorist .
If Paul is a public hearing , when he &apos;s talking , he can &apos;t say without armed guards .
He gets calls to his home because the people tell him they like to tell him they know where his kids are going to school .
And why ?
Because Paul is using a vaccine .
I need that not say .
But vaccines are essential .
Take them .
Turn them back . Terrible diseases .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
We have in this country now , measles .
And that &apos;s getting worse .
And pretty soon , kids will be back to dying .
Because that &apos;s just one question . The numbers .
And they will not just be on measles .
What is the polio ?
Take the polio .
Why not ?
A fellow militant of mine has given me a couple of weeks ago and said , &quot; She believes .
I am a little bit too shrill .
Nobody has that . &quot;
JE : Ever before , she said she wouldn &apos;t fight polio against her child .
She wouldn &apos;t be fine .
Why ?
Because we don &apos;t have polio .
And you know what ?
We had in this country yesterday , no polio .
Today , I don &apos;t know .
Maybe it was this morning .
Someone in Lagos , in an airplane , flying straight to the Los Angeles .
IM IMPORTANT IS HIS OVER OHIO ,
And in a few hours , it lands .
And rents a car .
And he comes after Long Beach .
And he gets one of these fantastic TED Dinner .
Today evening , he goes to visit , and he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s infected with a paralyzing disease .
And we know that as well , not .
Because that &apos;s how the world works .
Now , that &apos;s the planet . This is the planet we live on .
Do you not do it as if it &apos;s not ?
We love it . We love it in lying .
We love it .
Do you have it all this morning ? Have you taken your vitamins ? Echinacea .
A little antioxidant that gives you a little bit of help .
I know that you &apos;re doing that . Because the half of the Americans , that &apos;s what every day .
They take it .
And they take alternative remedies .
And it makes no difference how you &apos;re so often finding that you &apos;re useless .
The data shows that all the time .
They evaporate their urine more .
Do it almost never .
That &apos;s okay .
You want to like 28 billion dollars for dark urine to pay .
I agree with you completely : Dark urine , dark .
Why do we do that ?
Why do we do that ?
Well , I think I understand we hate the pharmaceutical industry .
We hate a drug industry too strong a government .
We have no confidence in the system .
And that should be what we should not do either . Our healthcare system is bad .
It &apos;s cruel to millions of people , right ?
It &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and it &apos;s soul @-@ deafening , even to us who afford to .
We walk , therefore , away from it .
And where are we going ?
We walk in the arms of the placebo industry .
That &apos;s great .
I love the placebo industry .
But you know , that &apos;s really a serious matter .
Because that stuff is crap .
And we give billions of dollars for it .
And I have all sorts of little props here , none of them . Gingko fraud . Echinacea fraud . Acai . I don &apos;t even know what .
That &apos;s , but we give billions of dollars for it .
It &apos;s fraud .
And you know what ?
If I do that , I scream at people shouting at me and saying , &quot; What cares you ? &quot;
&quot; Let people , anyway , do what they want . &quot;
So that &apos;s how they feel good .
And you know what ?
They have got wrong because it &apos;s not my mind whether it &apos;s the Health Minister .
The Health Minister says , &quot; Hmm . &quot;
I will continue to draw the evidence from my experts on mammography .
Not assume .
Not accept any cancer quack liver that can inject coffee into its patients .
If you look at this path , you go where faith and magic provide evidence and science replace , you get to a place , a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
You get to Thabo Mbeki , in South Africa .
He brought 400 000 of his people around because he was on the insistence that red beds , garlic and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs .
From those of whom we know they &apos;re going to be able to slow down the course of AIDS .
Hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country worse than any other country of this disease plagued by it .
Tell them to tell me , please don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
The ones you have , they have , they always have .
Well , the most brain @-@ free epidemic we &apos;re in right now is this absurd fight between the advocates of genetically modified food and the advocates of the bio @-@ elite .
That &apos;s a stupid debate .
It has to stop .
It &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
That &apos;s ideology .
It &apos;s not science .
Everything that we eat .
Every grain of rice , every branch of parsley .
Every sprouts have been made by people .
You know , there was no mandarin in paradise .
It was not Cantaloupe melons .
It was not Christmas trees .
We have that all done .
We have it in the last few 11 000 years .
And some of it worked .
And some of it didn &apos;t .
We &apos;re got rid of it .
What didn &apos;t work .
Now , we can do it more precisely .
And of course , there are risks .
But we can do something like vitamin A in rice .
And that stuff can do to millions of people .
Millions of people , their lives , to prolong .
That &apos;s what they don &apos;t want to do .
I have to say , I understand that .
We reject genetically modified .
Food disposes .
Why do we do that ?
Well , what I hear all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones .
Mono @-@ culture .
We want no huge fields with huge fields with one thing .
That &apos;s wrong .
We want not to have companies live patenting .
We want not to have companies patent seeds .
And you know what ?
My answer to all of this is , yes .
You have been right .
Fix . Let &apos;s fix that .
It &apos;s true .
We have a huge food problem .
But that &apos;s not science .
That &apos;s what science has nothing to do with .
It &apos;s right .
Morality , patent crab .
You know that the science is not a company .
It &apos;s not a country .
It &apos;s not even a idea .
It &apos;s a process .
It &apos;s a process .
And sometimes it works .
And sometimes it doesn &apos;t .
But the idea that we &apos;re going to be allowing science not to do its work is to do it .
Because we &apos;re afraid , it &apos;s a real impasse .
And it keeps millions of people in the flourishing world .
AB : You know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to get 70 percent more food to grow than we are at the moment .
70 percent .
These investments in Africa in the world over the last 30 years , embarrassing , shameful .
They need that .
And we &apos;re giving it to them .
And why ?
Genetically modified food .
We want people not to be encouraged .
This rotten stuff to eat like this , for example , Maniok Maniok is .
Something that &apos;s half a billion people eat .
It &apos;s about like a potato .
It &apos;s just a bundle of calories .
It &apos;s bad .
It has no nutrients .
It has no protein and scientists . They build .
All of this right there .
And then you could get people to eat and you wouldn &apos;t be blind .
They would not starve .
And you know what ?
That would be nice .
It would not be Chez Panisse .
But it would be nice and everything that I did to say about it is , why fight this ?
I mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves .
Why fight this ?
Because we don &apos;t push genes around .
It &apos;s not about genes being pushed around .
It &apos;s not about chemicals .
It &apos;s not about our ridiculous , ridiculous passion for hormones .
Our insistence on greater food , better food , unique food .
It &apos;s here , it &apos;s not about Rice Krispies .
It &apos;s about people at life , it &apos;s here to keep them alive .
And it &apos;s going to be high time to understand what that means .
Because you know what ?
If we do not do that , if we keep on going as we do before .
Do we do that to something that we owe ourselves to , I don &apos;t think we want to be guilty of ?
High @-@ tech colonialism .
It &apos;s not any other description for the things that are happening here .
It &apos;s selfish .
It &apos;s ugly .
It &apos;s our not worthy .
And we have to really stop that .
After this incredibly funny conversation , we want you , maybe , to say , &quot; Do you still want to be in this ridiculous time machine ? &quot;
And in the future , go to any case .
That wants me to do anyway .
In the moment , she &apos;s in the present .
But we have a tremendous opportunity , right ?
We can do this time machine on everything that we want .
We can put it where we want it to move .
And we &apos;re going to move it to where we want it to be .
We need to have these conversations .
And we need to think .
But if we &apos;re going to go into the time machine and into the future , we &apos;re going to be happy .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve done .
I know that we &apos;ve been able to do it .
And that &apos;s what I think is , as far as I &apos;m concerned , something the world needs now .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you . When Steve Lopez , columnist of the Los Angeles Times .
One day , through the streets in the center of Los Angeles , one day , he heard wonderful music .
You came from a man , a African @-@ American , sympathetic , rough , homeless , who was playing on a violin , who had only two strings left .
Many of you will hear the story . Because from Steves , articles about this later became a book , which in turn was filmed .
With Robert Downey , Junior , when Steve Lopez and Jamie Foxx , when Nathaniel Anthony Ayers , the contrabass player who was studying at the Juilliard Conservatory , and his promising career .
Tragically early on through his paranoid schizophrenia , he ended .
Nathaniel left Juilliard , suffered a nervous breakdown , and 30 years later he lived as homeless on the streets of the Skid Row .
In the center of Los Angeles
I recommend you all Steves &apos; book to read or get to know the movie so that you don &apos;t just read the wonderful connection that you have between these two men that has emerged , but also how music , this connection , creates .
Helped and how it eventually helped you to make the instrument when this word play is allowed , that helped .
Nathaniel off of the street to the street .
I met Mr. Ayers .
IM YEAR 2008 , two years ago , in the Walt Disney Concert Hall .
He had just had a demonstration of Beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony and Beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony , and he came behind the stage to imagine myself .
He spoke in a very cheerful way and sociable tone about the yo @-@ yo .
MA : And Hillary Clinton and about how the Dodgers did it never in the baseball , world series , would never do it .
And that &apos;s all because of the insidious passage .
The first violin in the last sentence of Beethoven &apos;s Fourth Symphony .
We came to the subject of music , and we came to talk a few days later , I got an email saying that Nathaniel was getting in for violin lessons with me .
I have to mention that Nathaniel is a medical treatment that he refused , because he was already in the process of electroshocks and thorazine and handcuffs , and he was already in the process of being treated with electroshocks .
One trauma that caused him all his life to persecute him when he was in the process of being particularly vulnerable .
For these schizophrenic phases ,
The ones are sometimes so bad that they can make him tear up .
And he &apos;s disappearing for days .
In the streets of Skid Row , he &apos;s always wandering around this horror and the torture torment of his own mind .
And in exactly the same stage of excitement , Nathaniel was when we were with our first lesson in class in the Walt Disney Concert Hall , where we started .
He had this miserable flickering in the way he saw it and he was totally lost .
He spoke about invisible demons and invisible smoke and about how we got someone in sleep to poison him .
I had been scared , not for my own sake , but for my fear that I could lose him , that he could sink into one of his states , and that I would give him his relationship with the violin .
If I started talking about clay ladders and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy , that &apos;s what I call the &quot; violin &quot; .
I started talking about just how to play .
I played the first sentence of the Beethoven Violin Concerto .
And as I played , I fell on the ground that in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes , a complete change was taking place .
It was when it was under his control , under the influence of an invisible doctor .
It was a chemical reaction , the catalyst of which was my game , and Nathaniel &apos;s maniac anger turned into understanding , into a calm curiosity and grace .
And how through a miracle did a miracle , he took his violin and began to listen .
Some excerpts of violin concerts to play and asked me to then play them to the end , and then I started playing them .
Mendelssohn Chaikovsky , Sibelius .
We started then , talking about music , and we started talking about music .
We started from Bach to Beethoven , Brahms , Bruckner and all the other BS of Bartók to all the ESA @-@ Pekka Salonen .
And I became aware that he was not only a cyclopedic encyclopedia of knowledge about music , but he was with it .
And he was also a close personal relationship .
He spoke about her with a close passion and a sense of understanding that I otherwise only talked about by my colleagues in the Philharmonic of Los Angeles . He was a musician playing music and playing music and talking about music , and from that paranoid , confused .
Man : He who was just going through the streets of Los Angeles , right ?
A kind of adorable , educated , excellent musician trained in Juilliard .
( Music is medicine . )
( Music changes us for Nathaniel . Means music . Mental health . )
Because that music allows it to allow it to have its thoughts and delusions with the help of imagination and creativity into something real .
And so it escapes its tormenting torment , right ?
I understood that exactly that is what the essence of art is .
It &apos;s exactly .
This is the reason why we &apos;re music making , so that we can do something that &apos;s deep inside of us all .
Our feelings through our artistic lens , through our creativity , through our creation , can shape into reality .
And the reality of that expression reaches us all , and moves , inspires and unites us .
What Nathaniel was doing , brought him to music back to the world , to a community of friends .
The redeeming power of music brought him to return to a community of friends , the redeeming power of music , to a family of musicians who understood him .
The ones who recognized his talent and respected him , and I &apos;m going to talk to Nathaniel again and again .
No matter whether in the Walt Disney Concert Hall or in the Skid Row , because he reminds me of why he reminds me why I became a musician .
Thank you very much .
Bruno Giussani : Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Robert Gupta , Robert Gupta : I want to play something that I shamefully play stolen from the cellist .
I hope you will forgive me .
I &apos;m Jane McGonigal .
I design computer games .
I develop now since 10 years , online games .
And my goal for the next 10 years is to do the same thing as easily .
The world in which reality is happening to save as it does in online games is to save .
I have a plan for that .
I want more people to convince , including all of you , more time playing with bigger and more amazing games , to spend .
Right now , we spend three billion hours a week playing online .
Some of you think maybe that &apos;s what it &apos;s like , a lot of time for games .
Maybe something about too much time .
If you think about how many problems we &apos;re facing in the real world as a matter of urgency .
In fact , my research at the Institute for the Future , according to my research , is exactly the opposite .
Right ? Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough .
In fact , I am convinced that if we &apos;re going to move on to this planet for the next century , we &apos;re going to have to dramatically increase that time .
I have calculated that the time needed is about 21 billion , 21 billion hours of playing time .
Per week , that &apos;s what it looks like .
First , maybe a little bit absurd .
So , I repeat , it &apos;s with that .
It works . It can work if we can have problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , I think we have to try .
Games online for at least 21 billion hours per week , up to the end of next decade , to play .
No .
I mean , it &apos;s really serious .
Why ?
This picture describes quite precisely .
Why ?
I think that games like this are so vital for the survival of the human species in the future .
Seriously .
This is a portrait of the photographer Phil Toledano .
He wanted to express the feelings of playing .
So he has in front of the players a camera .
This is one of the classic expressions .
In playing when you don &apos;t play when you &apos;re a player , you may miss some of the nuances .
In this picture , you probably see this sense of urgency for you .
Something of fear .
But also extreme concentration , deeply deepened .
In that solving of a really difficult problem .
If you &apos;re playing , you can see some nuances here , which are the eyes pulled upwards .
And the mouth is a sign of a optimism .
The eyebrows show surprise .
This is a player who is on the edge of what &apos;s called an epic .
Victory is , oh , you know that ?
OK .
Great .
So , we have some players here , an epic .
Victory is an outcome that is so extraordinary positive .
You didn &apos;t even know before that it was possible at all . It was almost beyond imagination .
And if you did , you &apos;re almost shocked that you &apos;re actually going to be doing this kind of thing .
That &apos;s a epical victory of this player , and it &apos;s about to be an epic victory .
And this is it , what we &apos;re doing on millions of faces of problem solvers all over the world .
If we &apos;re going to break the hurdles of the next century , face of those who are facing all odds at the edge of an epic victory .
Well , unfortunately , we &apos;re seeing this face more in real life .
If we &apos;re going to face difficult problems , I call it that in life , I &apos;m bad face .
And it &apos;s actually my face , actually .
See , yeah .
OK .
That &apos;s me .
How I do that in life ? I &apos;m bad face .
Do this . This is a graffiti in my former home country in Berkeley , California , where I did my PhD study .
Why do we play better ?
Why are we in play than in real life ? That &apos;s a problem .
The many players have we think we can do in the world in reality not so well .
And I mean , not only less successful .
Although that &apos;s part of it , we &apos;re doing more in the game world .
I mean , good in connection with the motivation , something meaningful about doing .
Inspired in collaboration with each other .
When we &apos;re in a game world , I think many people in us think that we &apos;re in our best version , at any time and immediately , helpful , persistent to solve the problem .
Try trying to solve the problem as long as necessary after the failure .
And try again in reality , when we fail , when we hit obstacles , we feel like we often feel different .
We feel like we &apos;re overwhelmed .
We feel like we feel ourselves .
We defeat , we feel threatened .
Maybe depressed .
Frustrated or
Cynical .
These feelings have been never felt .
If we play games in games in games , they just exist .
And that &apos;s it . That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to study as a PhD student .
Why is it in games ?
Impossible to think .
You could not just think anything could be done .
How can we do those feelings out of the games into the reality of the game ?
So , I looked at games like World of Warcraft . This is what the ideal environment for community problem solving is .
And I have some things to say .
The epic victories in online worlds .
So , making it possible first , if you &apos;re in one of these online games , especially at World of Warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters ready to be able to give you a world saving mission .
And that immediately .
But not only any mission , but also a mission .
The mission perfect for your current level in the game .
Right ?
So , you can do that .
You get never a task that you can &apos;t solve , you can &apos;t solve .
But always on the edge of your skills , so you have to make an effort .
But it &apos;s not unemployment .
There &apos;s no unemployment in World of Warcraft . You &apos;re not sitting around and you &apos;re turning around .
It &apos;s always quite targeted . There &apos;s something important to do .
And it &apos;s in some ways employees where they go .
Hundreds of thousands of people who are working with them to get their epic mission .
To conclude .
That &apos;s what we have in real life .
Not so easy .
That feeling that when you have a fingercut , you have employees who are willing to do it in some way .
And there &apos;s also this epic story .
These inspiring stories , why we &apos;re there .
And what we &apos;re doing is what we get to get this whole positive feedback .
It &apos;s certainly something that &apos;s high and high and strong at level one , or 1 intelligence .
This constant feedback gives you no idea what &apos;s true in life .
If I do this stage , I have no one talking , and I have one crazy idea .
20 .
Crazy idea .
I get 20 in real life .
This feedback , not .
So , the problem of online collaboration worlds like World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying .
Anytime , on the edge of an epic victory , that we prefer to keep standing all our time in these game worlds .
They &apos;re just better than the world of reality .
Until now , all the World of Warcraft players together have 5.93 million years to spend on this virtual problem of virtual problems from Azerbaijan .
This is not necessarily something bad .
It sounds like bad .
But to do it , in context , I think , five @-@ 93 million years ago , it started .
Our first primate ancestors , we started walking upright .
The first upright primacy .
So OK .
So if we talk about how we &apos;re going to spend so much time playing games right now , that makes sense .
When you start to spend time in terms of time on scale of human development before you look at it .
What &apos;s extraordinary , but also appropriate .
Because it &apos;s coming out that it turns out that by doing all of this time playing games , we actually change that .
What we as humans do in humans are able to do ?
We develop . We develop into community .
Thinking , heartfelt beings .
That &apos;s the truth .
That &apos;s what I believe in .
Look at it .
These interesting statistics , which were recently published by a Carnegie researcher , Mellon University , published .
The average young person of today , in a country with a strong playing culture , spends .
Ten thousand hours with online games , up to the age of 21 .
So 10 000 hours is a time of very interesting numbers from two reasons .
First of all , for children in the United States , 10 080 hours is the exact total time they spend in school , from the time of fifth grade to the end of high school .
If you never lack it , so we have here a complete parallel education path where young people are .
The same way that we learn what it means .
A good player to be like being everything else , whatever they do in school , learning .
And maybe you have some of them doing the new book of Malcolm Gladwell .
Overflying skiers .
So you know his theory of being successful .
The theory of success , the theory of the 10,000 hours .
You know , it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science that if we spend 10,000 hours with laborious study of any subject , until we 21 years of age , we will master .
That is , we will do so well in it .
What &apos;s whatever you do , whatever you do , like the most important people in the world .
So what we do here is what you have is a complete generation of young people who are master players , and so the big question is , what exactly are players ?
Masterful , good .
Because if we do this , if we could figure out , we would have , kind of , never before , ever had any human potential at our disposal .
So many people have we at present in the world , the world , who have at least an hour a day playing online .
This is our master players : 500 million people .
The extraordinary .
Good .
In something , there are .
And in the next decade , we have another billion players , the extraordinary good at playing what is whatever .
If you do it not yet heard it , the game industry has developed consoles that save energy .
And on mobile networks , instead of broadband Internet , they work .
So players can work all over the world , especially in India .
China , Brazil , play online , you can expect .
One additional billion players in the next decade .
So this is a total of 1.5 billion players .
So I have started to think about what it is .
What we have in these games to master .
Here are the four things that are the four things I found .
When I first came up with urgency optimism .
OK .
Imagine if you could , like extreme self @-@ motivation .
Urgent optimism is desire to do something right away .
An obstacle to overcome together with the challenge of believing that we &apos;re going to have a reasonable hope of success .
Players believe always in believing that a epical victory is possible . And that it &apos;s possible always worth it , it &apos;s worth trying .
And that &apos;s equal . Players don &apos;t sit around .
Players are masters in spiders .
Poets of social networks .
It &apos;s a lot of interesting research .
The ones show that we people more like .
After we &apos;ve got to play with them , even if they &apos;re defeating us .
The reason for that is that it &apos;s a lot of trust that requires someone to play a game .
We trust in somebody to have time with us . We trust that the rules will be respected . We trust that we have the same goal .
And until the end of the game .
And that &apos;s where the ability to play together is allowed .
That &apos;s where the growth of ties , trust and interconnectedness is .
And as a result , we build stronger social relationships , happy productivity .
Fantastic .
You know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of Warcraft player is 22 hours a week .
So , as part @-@ time job .
It &apos;s because of that , if we play , we &apos;re actually happier at working hard to do .
When , if we relax or relax or do nothing .
We know that we &apos;re human beings , as human beings , working optimally .
When we work hard , meaningful work and players are always always ready , hard to work .
When they do the right job , and eventually , epic meaning , players love it , part awe .
Adorable .
Missions of planetary proportions to become .
Here &apos;s a background information to get this right .
You know , you probably all know Wikipedia .
That &apos;s the biggest Wiki in the world .
That &apos;s the second largest Wiki in the world , with almost 80,000 entries .
That &apos;s the World of Warcraft Wiki , five million people use it every month .
They have more information about World of War Warcraft .
In the Internet , they &apos;ve collected it than any other topic in any other Wiki in the world .
They create a epic story .
They create an epic source of the knowledge about the World of War Warcraft .
OK .
That &apos;s what four superpowers are , which lead to a single result .
Players are super @-@ powerful , hopeful individuals .
It &apos;s people .
They believe that they are individuals , as individuals , able to change the world .
And that only problem is that they can believe .
They can do virtual worlds change .
But not the real .
That &apos;s the problem that I have to solve .
Edward Castronova is a scientist , his work is brilliant .
He &apos;s studying .
Why people like so much time , energy and money in online worlds ?
And he says , &quot; We &apos;re witnessing not less than no less mass emigration into virtual worlds . &quot;
And online gaming environments , and this by an economist , so he &apos;s logical .
And he says , &quot; Not as I do . &quot;
I develop games .
I &apos;m something exuberant .
So he says that makes actually , in fact , sense .
Because players can play in online worlds more than they can in real life .
They can do in games stronger social ties , than in real life ,
They get more feedback and rewards and rewards .
In games than in real life , so he says it &apos;s like , &quot; It &apos;s perfectly logical right now that players have more time in the virtual world than in real life . &quot;
I agree with you first .
That &apos;s logical .
But it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation .
We have to start to build the real world into a game .
My inspiration comes from a moment of events .
That second .
500 years .
It &apos;s back .
It &apos;s got these ancient cubes out .
Sheepskin bowels .
You know , in front of these fantastic game econtrollers , there were sheep bowels .
And that was kind of the first of people @-@ developed .
Play equipment .
And if you &apos;re going to work with the works of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus .
You know , maybe ?
These stories , the story about how and why games were invented ,
According to Herodotus , games became more precise craps in the kingdom of Lydia .
While in famine , supposedly there were been a famine of this magnitude that the king had to be so hungry that the king of Lydia decided to become a crazy idea .
The people suffered the people , the people fought .
It was a extreme situation .
You needed a extreme solution .
So they invented , according to Herodotus .
That dice game and agreed a national strategy .
At one day , you would eat .
At the next day , you would play .
And they would play so much in the dice game , they would be so deeply immersed .
Because games are so fascinating and so fascinating and we would be satisfied with happy productivity that they would forget that it &apos;s nothing to eat .
And then , the next day , you would play .
And then the next day , you would eat .
And according to Herodotus , they survived 18 years of age .
These famines , by living on a day , and on a day of playing the next day , I think we &apos;re going to do the same .
Today , we &apos;re going to play .
We &apos;re going to play games to help alleviate the suffering of the real world .
We &apos;re going to play games to make sure we don &apos;t miss anything that &apos;s not working in the real world .
Everything that &apos;s working in real life that &apos;s not satisfying .
And we &apos;re going to pick up what we need .
We &apos;re going to get out of the games .
But that has to be the end , isn &apos;t it ?
That &apos;s the exciting thing .
According to Herodotus , after 18 years , famine didn &apos;t get any better .
So , the king decided to make a final dice game .
She shared that kingdom .
In two halves .
She played a dice game .
And the winners were allowed to become an epic adventure .
Breaking up , they left lydia and made themselves up looking for the search for a new home .
They left just like many people . They left as many people as food to survive .
And they looked for the rest of the area in which they were thriving , with the rest .
That sounds crazy , right ?
But the latest DNA evidence shows that the Etruscans , who later became the Roman Empire .
The same DNA as the ancient DNA as the Lydians .
So it was recently that scientists came to the conclusion that herodotus , crazy story , is actually true .
And geologists found evidence of a global cooling down that nearly 20 years took , which was the explanation of famine .
So maybe this crazy story could be right .
Maybe they have actually their people , through games , saved their people by 18 years of saving themselves in games , by escaping .
And then this inspiration had , and so much about the stuff that we learned about playing with each other , that it saved the whole civilization .
So , that &apos;s what we can .
We play since 1994 Warcraft .
That was the first strategy game in real time .
The World of Warcraft series .
That was before 16 years ago .
It was 18 years of playing craps .
We play craps for 16 years .
I &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic .
Game .
So , they sent half of their civilization to the search for the search for a new world .
So , I &apos;m taking my 21 billion hours of play a week .
We should be agreeing that the world is half of us , one hour a day , playing games .
Until we reach the problems of the real world , we have solved them .
I know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; How do we solve problems ? &quot;
The real world in games .
And exactly that question is one that I &apos;ve done my work on in recent years at the Institute for the Future .
We &apos;ve got this banner in our office in Palo Alto , Palo Alto .
It expresses out how we can make the future understand .
We want not to try to make the future say beforehand what we want .
Is the future to be created ?
We want to make the best possible outcome .
And then people get empowered to empower this idea into reality .
We put ourselves in epic victories . And we give people the opportunity to make it happen .
I &apos;m going to show you three games very briefly that I designed to play to try and emulate people epic victories .
In their own future , to make it this way , this is the world without oil .
This game is from 2007 .
It &apos;s a game online where it &apos;s a shortage of oil that you have to overcome .
It &apos;s a game where oil shortages are invented .
But we have enough content online to make it available to you to realistically .
And you have your real life , in fact , without oil .
So if you look at the game , you say to us where you live .
And then you get news movies in real time that show you how much oil costs you what it doesn &apos;t exist .
How food supplies are affected , how transport is .
Does it affect schools , whether schools are closed , whether there are riots ?
And it &apos;s up to you to figure out how to shape your real life .
If it &apos;s true , and we ask you to do that , blog videos or photos , and you can do it .
We have this game with a one hundred players in 2007 , tested .
And we have them since then , about the last three years , accompanied them .
And I can tell you it &apos;s been a changing experience .
Nobody wants to live his life because it &apos;s good for the environment .
Or ?
Because we do .
But if you &apos;re in an epic adventure , and you &apos;re told , &quot; Get us , oil is out . &quot;
That &apos;s a fascinating adventure on the one hand that you &apos;re going to go to .
Find out what you &apos;re going to survive .
The majority of our players have the ones in the game that have kept the habits that they learned .
So , we &apos;ve chosen to do the next world saving game .
A bigger , higher goal than the only oil shortage .
We &apos;ve got the Superstruct game on the Institute for the Future , developed it .
The starting point is to calculate a supercomputer that people only have to 23 years to go on the planet .
This supercomputer is called Global .
Dignition / Sensitization System .
Of course , the call to players to sign up .
Have we almost , like a Jerry Bruckheimer film , made it ?
You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies where it &apos;s the dream team .
You &apos;ve got the astronaut , the scientist , the ex @-@ Sträfling , and just together .
Can you make the world save ?
But in our game .
Instead of just five people saying , we say , &quot; Everyone &apos;s on the dream team . &quot;
And it &apos;s our job .
The future for energy , food , health , safety and the future of social justice .
Eight thousand players played this game .
Eight weeks ,
They found 500 incredible creative solutions . They read them out ,
If you &apos;re Google Superstruct , and the last game we bring to play on March 3rd .
It &apos;s a game in collaboration with the team of the World Bank .
If you do the game , you get from the World Bank the award of social .
Reformer : 2010 completion .
We work with universities in all over Sub @-@ Saharan Africa and invite them to redesign social , learning .
We have a comic book on this .
We have levels high for regional , regional understanding .
Knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
I want to invite you all to play this game with young people to share .
Everywhere on the planet , especially around the world , in development areas .
The ones who benefit from this are their own social ventures to imagine their own social ventures to save the world .
I come now to the end .
I want to leave you with a question : What do you think is happening ?
When I come next , what happens ?
We have all these fantastic players .
We have games that give us a picture of what we can do .
But we have games that show us what we can do .
Well , I hope you will tell me that you agree that players have human resources that we can use to work in real life .
And that games are a big issue for change .
We have these whole superpowers , happy productivity .
The ability to have tight social networks . Urgency optimism .
And that desire for epiepical meaning .
I hope really that we together together will have important games to play in this planet to make another century of survival .
And I hope you will , with me , play these games and design them .
If I go to the next decade , I &apos;m going to be looking forward to two things : That we can create any imaginable future , and that we can create all kinds of games .
So I &apos;m going to say , let &apos;s play the world @-@ changing games .
Let &apos;s start .
Thank you .
Since some time , I &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect .
It may be strange that the world @-@ changing games are interested in this .
It &apos;s not unless you look at it like me , as a deception that leads to something real .
If somebody just gets stuck enough to believe in it , in other words , have sugar pills .
In some studies , a measurable effect has shown the placebo effect , and only because of that .
Because the person thinks what to do with it is .
A pharmaceutical or a kind of a kind of pain management .
To take one example , if the patient is only solid enough to believe in it , there is measurable action in the body that is called the placebo effect .
A deception is becoming something real , because somebody somebody like this perceives it so that we can also understand each other .
I &apos;m going to give you a basic , very simple magic trick .
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works .
That &apos;s a trick that &apos;s at least been around since the 1950s in every children &apos;s magic book .
I myself have it from the cub scout magic .
The scout scout in the 1970s learned .
I &apos;m going to teach it for you and then explain it to you .
And then I &apos;m going to explain why I explain it .
So , look at what &apos;s going on .
That knife , the knife you can look at .
My hand , the one you can look at .
I &apos;m going to just look at that knife in my fist .
I &apos;m going to push my sleeves back .
And around the way , to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeves or comes out of it , I &apos;m just going to push my wrist right here .
On those lines , you can see that there &apos;s no one at all moving .
As long as I can get impressions here , nothing can go into my sleeves or come out .
And that goal , in fact , is very simple .
I &apos;m going to open my hand .
And hopefully , if everything goes well , that knife will go through my bare physical magnetism , and that &apos;s what I call it .
It sits actually like this tight .
It sits in its place that I shake it without it shaking , without the knife falling down .
Nothing moves .
It &apos;s in my sleeves , or it comes out , no trickery .
And it can do everything .
TA @-@ DA : Well , this is a trick that I often teach small kids who are interested in magic .
Because you can do it a lot about deception , because you can learn a lot about deception .
If you &apos;re looking more closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick to do .
I think many of you here probably know about this .
This trick , it works like this .
I think that knife is .
In my hand , I say that I &apos;m going to close my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or comes out .
And that &apos;s a lie .
The reason why I &apos;m going to tie my wrist is because it &apos;s actually the secret of the illusion .
In that moment , when I &apos;m going to shake my hand away from you so that you can see it moving from behind .
It &apos;s this finger here , my index finger , just moving from where it was to a position where it was , stretched out like that .
Great trick , because it &apos;s back there .
It &apos;s somebody who &apos;s not had a childhood .
So he &apos;s in here , right ?
And if I &apos;m turning around , the finger changes its position .
And now , you could talk about why this is a deception .
Why you &apos;re not realizing that this is just three fingers down here to see , because the mind and the mind and the way it &apos;s processing information , they &apos;re not counting individually .
One , two , three , but they see it as a group .
But that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about .
Now here .
Actually , not at all .
And then open up my hand , right ?
Of course , it &apos;s held there .
But not by the magnetism of my body , but by a trick , by my index finger , which is there now .
And if I do my hand shut , the same thing happens by turning back , it &apos;s by this movement hidden that the finger is again moving back .
I take this hand away .
And here &apos;s the knife .
This trick can be used by you , your friends and neighbors .
Thank you .
Now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ?
Well , a year ago or so , I read a study that really really bypassed me , actually .
I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher .
And so that was for me , a really amazing thing .
It has turned out to be this .
If you &apos;re a placebo in the form of a white pill , where you &apos;re in the form of an aspirin tablet , it &apos;s just a round of white pill that has a certain measurable effect .
But if you &apos;re in the shape of the shape in which you give placebo , for example , into a smaller pill .
And these blue dyes and you color a letter on it is it actually measurable , more effective .
And that , even though none of these are any pharmaceutical .
It &apos;s just sugar pills .
But one white pill is not a very good pill as good as a blue pill .
Pille : What made me really do flipping out of it .
It put itself , however , out that this hasn &apos;t all been done yet .
If you put capsules , they &apos;re still more effective than tablets .
Everybody , shape , color capsule , that &apos;s at one end yellow .
And at the other end red is better than one white capsule , right ?
Also , dosage plays a role . A pill twice a day is not that good , as good as three pills .
I can &apos;t get myself to the one that &apos;s the exact statistics .
Remember ?
Does I &apos;m sorry ?
That &apos;s the key .
But is that the other thing is that dosage also plays a role .
And the shape plays a role .
And if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to grab the needle .
Right ?
A syringe with a ineffective one , a few milliliters , an ineffective substance that you can give to a patient .
That creates a very strong image , right ?
In your head , that &apos;s a lot stronger than a white pill .
These are graphs that are really .
I &apos;m going to give you another time .
If we have a projector , the fact is that the fact is that the white pill isn &apos;t as good as the blue pill .
Pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that works as a needle .
And nothing of that has any real pharmaceutical property .
It &apos;s just our faith in it , which is in us stronger impact .
I wanted to know if I could take this idea for a magic trick .
I take something that is obviously a deception . And I leave it real to look .
We know , of course , from that study , that you can grab a needle .
If it goes to the point , this is a 18 @-@ inch @-@ long needle .
It &apos;s very , very sharp .
And I &apos;m going to start by giving you a little bit of sterilizing .
That &apos;s this really my flesh .
It &apos;s not Damian &apos;s special bred meat .
That &apos;s this : My skin .
That &apos;s not a special effect .
Hollywood .
I &apos;m going to now put this needle in my skin and go through it and drive it until it &apos;s on the other side , and it &apos;s going to get out of it .
If you &apos;re going to get bad when you &apos;re easily fainting .
I have this . I have some friends .
Last night .
Last night . I showed you in the hotel room .
And some people who I don &apos;t know , and there &apos;s a woman , almost powerless , who &apos;s been there .
I &apos;m going to suggest , if you &apos;re going to get bad quickly , look for the next 30 seconds away .
Or ...
You know what ?
I &apos;m going to start the first delicate part here in the back .
You can do it in a moment .
See , you can do it away .
If you want , so it &apos;s going to be right here where my meat starts .
AM : At the bottom of my arm , I &apos;m just going to do a little bit of a little bit of a break .
Do I really regret ?
Do you do that crazy ?
And now , just a little bit through my skin .
And on the other side , like this , out again .
Now , we &apos;re actually in the same situation , which we &apos;re in with the knife trick .
About , but now you can do my fingers don &apos;t count .
Or ...
So , I &apos;m going to show you .
That &apos;s one , two , three , four , five .
Now , yeah , I know what people think .
If you do see that , you say , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s probably not so stupid . &quot;
And it goes through itself , the skin just to give us a few minutes to walk around .
Now , then I &apos;ll tell you , I &apos;ll show you .
How does that look like ?
Pretty good .
Yeah .
I know .
And the people in the back say , &quot; Okay . &quot;
I have that not right .
The people in the adjoining rooms come now in , let them put it in , let me tell you from near .
That &apos;s really my skin .
That &apos;s not a special effect .
Hollywood .
That &apos;s my flesh .
And I can do that around . I &apos;m sorry .
If you &apos;re getting bad , look away .
Look at it .
Don &apos;t look at people in the back or those who sometime later on watch it on video will say , &quot;
Well , yeah . &quot;
That looks like a lot .
Impressive .
But if it &apos;s real , it would look like , &quot; You see , here &apos;s a hole .
And there , if it &apos;s really real , it would bleed . &quot;
Okay .
Let &apos;s let me just add a little blood to you .
Squeeze out , yeah .
Here &apos;s it .
Normally it would be me now to take out the needle .
I would take out my arm and clean it and show you that there are no wounds there .
But I think in this frame , here and with the frame , with the intention of delusion , to make something real , I &apos;m going to just put the needle in there .
And so , from the stage , we &apos;re going to go into the next few days , and we &apos;ll meet again a few times .
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that .
Thank you very much .
So I have a lot of life in my life .
I &apos;ve only known two .
I loved only two . The first one was more like a passionate affair .
It was a beautiful fish .
It was tasty .
Good consistency .
Graduate .
A bestseller .
On the menu .
What a good fish , even better .
It got better in aquaculture after aquaculture , supposedly the highest standards of sustainability .
You could get yourself well at that .
I had a good beauty with that beauty , a relationship over several months .
One day , the boss of the company called and asked , did I start growing in an event , about the supposedly sustainability of the farm ?
Of course , I said , &quot; Here was a company that was trying to solve what this unimaginable problem for our chefs has become .
How do we keep fish on our menus ?
In the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been living fishing the seas , fishing forests , barren beaten .
It &apos;s hard to see the destruction overestimated . 90 percent of the big fish that &apos;s been loved by us .
The tuna that &apos;s called the curative butte , the salmon , the swordfish .
They &apos;re collapsed .
It &apos;s almost nothing more left .
So it &apos;s likely to be aquaculture or bad aquaculture .
Fish growing .
A part of our future .
Many arguments against it : Fish farming plants pollute the environment .
The majority of them .
Anyway .
And they &apos;re inefficient .
Take the tuna . A big disadvantage .
It has a feed recovery of 15 percent to one .
That means :
15 pounds .
Wild fish are needed to make you make a pound of farmed tuna .
Not very sustainable tastes , not even very good .
So here was finally a company , at last .
The one that tried to get it right .
I wanted to support them .
AM : The day before the event , I called the head of public relations for the company .
Call it the name .
Don Don said , I just said , &quot;
TO THE FACTS
Right ? &quot;
To have her , you &apos;re famous for that .
So far out there in the sea , you grow the environment so that you don &apos;t pollute .
That &apos;s true , &quot; he said .
&quot; We &apos;re so far out there that the waste from our fish is distributed , not concentrated . &quot;
And then he added , &quot;
&quot; We &apos;re basically a separate one .
These feed recycling of 2.5 percent to one percent , &quot; he said , &quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
Two and a half to one , great 2.5 to one , what feeds ?
You &apos;re sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; Great , &quot; he said . &quot; I put up , and that evening I lay in bed thinking , &quot; What the hell is a sustainable protein ? &quot;
So he called me the next day .
Shortly before the event , Don , I called .
I said , &quot; Don , what , for example , are sustainable proteins ?
He said , he knows that &apos;s not .
He &apos;s going to ask . &quot;
Now , I telephoned with a couple of people in the company .
Nobody could tell me a proper answer .
Until I finally got to the senior biologist on the phone , we call him the same .
Don Don said , &quot; What about , for example , sustainable proteins ? &quot;
Well , he mentioned some algae .
And some fishmeal .
And then he said , chicken pellets .
I said chicken pellets .
He said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Feathers , skin .
Bone flour .
Remnants dried .
And to feed processed .
I said , &quot; How much percent of your food is chicken in the assumption of maybe two percent ? &quot;
Well , these are about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
&quot; I said , don , what &apos;s sustainable about it ? Chicken to feed fish ? &quot;
It was a long break in the world of leadership .
And he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chicken on the planet .
I loved myself , I loved this fish .
No .
Not because I was a self @-@ righteous connoisseur and a good man .
That &apos;s me , even .
No .
I have no . &quot; I actually loved this fish because I swear by God , the fish after this conversation after this conversation after chicken tasted .
This second fish .
This is a different species of fish love story .
It &apos;s the romantic species that is the species where you &apos;re ever better off your own fish , because you know the fish , the more you love it .
I have it first in a fish restaurant in southern Spain .
It &apos;s a friend journalist who had long been talking about this fish .
She &apos;s been kind of cupping us .
He came up with the table with a bright one .
Almost shimmering .
White one .
Color one .
The cook had him cooked .
Hold twice . Amazingly , he was still delicious .
Who can you buy a fish ?
So good taste . After he tastes cooked ,
I can taste it .
But this guy can &apos;t call it , we call it Miguel .
In fact , he &apos;s called Miguel , and no .
He has the fish , not cooked .
And he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way they and I are under that .
He &apos;s a biologist with Veta , La Palma .
That &apos;s a fish rearing in which southwest corner .
Spain , she &apos;s near the mouth of the river Guadalquivir , right down to the 1980s .
The farm in the hands of the Argentines .
She grew meat cattle on what was in fact wetlands , which was actually wetlands .
They made this by doing this by making the land drainage .
They built these complicated sequences of this channel .
And they pushed water out of the country . And they pushed it out .
In the river .
Now , they couldn &apos;t make it happen that didn &apos;t work economically and ecologically . It was a disaster .
It brought about 90 percent of the birds around .
What a disaster that place !
A lot of birds are .
And so , in 1982 , a Spanish company with environmental awareness .
This country bought .
What did you do ?
You bought the river of water .
You have literally the lever laid over .
Instead of the water pushing out , you used the channels to push the water back .
Put it in . You flooded the channels .
You created a 11 000 acres of fish farming , perch , sea ash , shrimp , eel .
And in doing so , Miguel .
And his company , the ecological destruction , completely reversed .
The farm is incredible .
I mean , you &apos;ve got something like this before .
You &apos;re staring out at the horizon of one million miles , a million miles away .
And everything that you see is all flooded canals .
And these density , lush march .
I was there in front of me , not long ago , with Miguel .
He &apos;s a tremendous guy .
Three parts .
Charles Darwin .
And one part , a crocodile to kiss .
Okay .
There were us and we fought ourselves through the wetlands .
And I chastise and sweat . I have mud up to my knees and Miguel keeps holding in peace .
A biology lecture here , he lifts a rare track .
Now , he mentions mineral needs of phytoplankton .
And here &apos;s what he sees , a pattern of bundles that he &apos;s looking at in Tanzanian giraffe .
Remembering it , it turns out that Miguel has the largest part of his career in Mikumi National Park in Africa , in Africa .
I asked him how he was going to get a fish expert like this .
He said , &quot; Fish , I don &apos;t know about fish .
I &apos;m a fish expert . I &apos;m an expert in relationships .
And then he goes and falls and falls into more talk . &quot; Rare birds and more algae .
And strange aquatic plants and you know , don &apos;t get me wrong .
That was really fascinating .
You know , the biotic community , unplugged , so in the way it &apos;s great .
But I was in love .
And my head got weak over the way that boiled piece of delicious fish that I was eating on the eve .
So I got him interrupted .
I said Miguel .
How does it happen that your fish is so good ?
He showed up the algae .
I know boy , the algae of phytoplankton .
The relationships
That &apos;s incredible .
But what do you eat ?
How is the recycling of feed ?
Well , he goes , &quot; I tell you that it &apos;s such a rich system . It &apos;s that the fish eat what they eat in the wild , &quot;
&quot; The vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton . &quot;
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s what the fish feed .
That system is like healthy .
It &apos;s completely self @-@ explanatory .
It &apos;s not food .
The food is from a farm . It doesn &apos;t feed its animals , later on the day I drove .
It &apos;s on this plot with Miguel around .
And I asked him .
I said , &quot; For a place that &apos;s so natural to be different from any place that you farm that I ever have been to .
How does it measure success in the moment ? &quot; It was like a film director was changing stage , right ?
And we bowed around the corner , and we offered ourselves a place that was the most incredible sight .
Thousands and thousands and thousands of pinkers flamingos , literally pinker carpet .
So far as the eye can see , that &apos;s success .
Said he , &quot; Look at her bellies . &quot;
Pink .
She &apos;s smuggling , slugging .
I was totally confused .
I said Miguel , &quot; Don &apos;t mess your fish . &quot;
Yeah , he said .
&quot; We lose 20 percent of our fish .
And fish eggs to birds . &quot;
Now , last year , this was on this plot 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
It &apos;s today the largest .
And one of the most important private bird reserves in Europe has become .
I said Miguel is a good bird . Not a thriving bird .
That last thing you can do on a fish rearing , he shook his head .
No .
He said , &quot; We &apos;re building extensively , not intensive . &quot;
That &apos;s this : An ecological network .
That &apos;s the flamingos eating the shrimps , the shrimps eating the phytoplankton , the pinker .
So , the belly , the better .
That system .
Okay .
Let &apos;s let &apos;s think about that .
A farm that has its animals not feeding .
And a farm that has its success on the health of its predators ,
A fish rearing , but also a bird reserve .
Oh , and by the way , these flamingos shouldn &apos;t even be there from the outset .
They breed in a city 240 in a mile away , where the soil quality is better .
For the nest building every morning , they fly 240 in a farm .
And every night , they fly .
They fly 240 in a row .
They go back because they do that because they &apos;re on the beaten white line of the A92 highway .
In fact , seriously .
I had a very kind of journey that penguins had imagined .
So , I looked at Miguel .
I said Miguel .
&quot; Fly them .
240 kilometers to go . &quot;
&quot; The farm and fly them then . &quot;
240 kilometers back .
AM Evening , they do that for the kids .
He looked at me when he looked at me as if I had just heard Whitney Houston quote a song .
He said , &quot; No .
They &apos;re doing that . &quot;
Because that &apos;s because the food is better .
I have no that skin of my lover &apos;s fish .
I &apos;ve mentioned the delicacies , and I don &apos;t like the skin of fish .
I like it . I don &apos;t like it sucked .
I like it . I don &apos;t like it crispy .
It &apos;s this biting , charred taste .
I cook almost never with it .
And yet , when I put it in this restaurant in southern Spain , I tried it at all , it didn &apos;t taste for fish skin .
It tasted sweet and pure when it was like you had a bite from the ocean .
I mentioned that to Miguel .
And he nodded .
He said , &quot; The skin looks like a sponge . &quot;
She &apos;s the last defense before you have anything in your body that comes in .
She has got herself over the course of evolution to develop impurities to suck up .
And then he added , &quot;
But our water has no impurities .
Okay .
A farm that has its fish not feeding .
A farm that has its success measured by success in the success of its predators . &quot;
And then it got to me , when he says , &quot; A farm that has no impurities , it undermines enormous . &quot;
Because that water , which is through that farm , comes from the river Guadalquivir in the river .
It &apos;s a river that has all of these things to do with it , rivers that flow today tend to do with them , to lead them .
Chemical pollutants , outflow of pesticides .
And if it &apos;s going through the system , it &apos;s been fighting , and it &apos;s leaving , the water is cleaner than it &apos;s come in .
That system is so healthy .
It cleans the water .
So , not only a farm that &apos;s cleaning its animals , it &apos;s not feeding their animals .
It &apos;s not just a farm that &apos;s successful in health , but also in measuring its success in the predators &apos; health , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water treatment plant .
And not only for these fish , but also for you , too .
And me .
Because if that water flows out , it sinks into the Atlantic , a drop in the ocean .
I know .
But I take it .
And that should be you , too .
Because these love stories , romantic , whatever , are also revealing .
You could say that they &apos;re a recipe , for which they &apos;re going to be good food for the future .
Whether we &apos;re eating perch or meat cattle , what we &apos;re going to need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , of one in which food is .
In fact , taste good .
But for many people , that &apos;s a little bit too radical .
We &apos;re not realists .
We enjoy .
We &apos;re lovers .
We love weekly markets .
We love small ones .
Family farms .
We talk about regional food .
We eat .
Bio and when they claim that they &apos;re the things , they &apos;re the future of good food insurance , they stand .
Someone somewhere on and says , &quot; Hey guys , I love Pinke Flamingos . &quot;
But how are you going to make the world feed ?
How are you going to feed the world ?
Can I honestly be honest .
I like these questions .
Not .
No .
Not .
Because we already have enough calories produced to make the world more than just to feed the world .
One billion people are going to starve today .
One billion .
That &apos;s more than ever before .
Because of stark inequalities in distribution , not the total production .
Now , I like this question , not because it &apos;s the logic of our food system , the last 50 years , that has been determining .
Feed grain . Feed it to vegetable fodder , pesticides , monocultures , chemicals , chicken to the Earth , fish , and all the time , the agricultural industry has just asked .
If we want more people to feed cheaper , how horrible can that be ?
That was the reason .
It was the justification .
It was the business plan of the American agriculture .
We should feed them what they call what they are .
It was a liquidation industry , a business that quickly became ecological capital , which is exactly this production that enabled .
That &apos;s not a business .
And it &apos;s not agriculture .
Our grain chamber is now threatened , not because of decreasing supply , but because of decreasing resources .
Not by the latest Moravian mowers and tractor inventions , but by fertile land .
Not by pumps , but by fresh water , not by chainsaws , but by forests .
And not by fishing boats .
And nets , but by fish in the sea .
They want the world to feed .
Let &apos;s let &apos;s start with the question .
How are we going to feed ourselves or better ?
How can we create conditions that are conducive to any community , to self @-@ feed , to feed to do that ?
Look at it . Don &apos;t look at the agricultural industrial model for the future .
It &apos;s really old .
And it &apos;s done .
Capital , chemistry and machines are in it .
And it has never had anything really good to eat .
Look at the food instead , the ecological model .
That &apos;s the one that &apos;s on two billion years of work experience .
Look at this , Miguel .
Farmers like Miguel , farms that don &apos;t create worlds for themselves .
Farmers like Miguel , farms that restore .
Farmers that restore . Instead of using farms that grow extensively .
Instead of just intensive farmers who don &apos;t just produce , but experts for relationships .
Because they &apos;re the ones who are experts for taste , too .
And if I really honestly am honest , they &apos;re a better cook .
As I did ever be , they know , you know , that &apos;s right .
Because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious .
It &apos;s thanks .
I grew up with a lot of science fiction . In my school days , I drove with the bus to the school , every day , an hour per way .
And my nose stuck always in the same book , a science fiction book .
That &apos;s my thoughts into other worlds that kidnapped me and narrated me .
My deep into me is insatiable , insatiable curiosity that satisfied this curiosity , and it was also shown that whenever I was not in the world of school , I was always strolling through the woods , wandering and sampling , frogs and snakes and beetles .
And pond water , everything brought home .
And under the microscope , I looked at it , I was totally enthusiastic about science .
You know , it was always going to be about trying to get the world .
And the limits of what could be done , and exploring my love of science .
Fiction seemed to be in my environment reflecting .
Because back then , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea , Jacques Cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows that brought us animals and places and a world full of wonders that we had previously never imagined we could have imagined .
The Commission then seems to have done a good job in matching this science fiction role .
And I was an artist .
I could draw .
I could paint .
And there it was no video games , nor this saturation , with computer @-@ generated films , nor the whole visual language .
In the media landscape , I had to give the pictures in my head .
That had to be what we all had at the time .
If we were kids , we had to read a book , we took the author &apos;s description and projected it onto the screen .
In our minds , my reaction to that was drawing and drawing and painting aliens aliens aliens worlds , robots , spacecraft .
And all of that .
In math class , I was constantly taught by the teacher .
How I got caught in the textbook hidden around , the creativity had to sort of get out , and it was happening .
Something interesting , which is what happened to me on Jacques Cousteaus &apos; shows was .
The idea of a us completely completely unknown world here on this planet on our planet .
Even certainly , I would never ever have an alien world with an spaceship , I would never reach .
That seemed to me quite unlikely .
But here was a world that was me , actually , able to enter .
Here , on Earth , and you know , it was just as fascinating and exotic as anything I thought I &apos;d ever imagined .
When I was reading these books , so I decided , as I was 15 , when I was a diver .
That only problem with this was that I was in a small village in Canada , in one thousand kilometers from the nearest ocean , right ?
Of this , I left myself not discouraged .
I was annoyed by my father until he finally got a diving school in Buffalo , New York , where he was .
And that &apos;s exactly the other side of the border where we lived .
I made my diving certificate in a pool that was YMCA in the middle of winter in Buffalo , New York .
The ocean , but a real ocean , I got only two years later to see it .
When we went to California since then , in the 40 years since , which have passed , I &apos;ve got about 3,000 hours under water underwater , and I &apos;ve been living in the ocean for a few years .
500 hours of that in submersible boats .
And I &apos;ve learned that the world is the deep sea itself , even in the flatter oceans , so rich in fascinating life .
How we do it really , really hard to imagine , the imagination of nature knows .
No limits .
No limits . Unlike our own miserable human imagination .
Until the present day , I feel deepest awe for the most profound I have for what I see on my dives .
And my love for the ocean keeps on with the same intensity as ever .
And ever since I was then , as an adult , a career , it was that filmmaking .
That seemed to be the best way to make my inner urge to tell stories .
With my need to take pictures , to combine them as a child , I was constantly drawing comic books .
And so , so films were the way , pictures and stories were brought together .
That fit together .
Of course , the stories I was telling were from the stories I chose from the science fiction field : Terminator Aliens and Abyss . At Abyss , I could have my preference for the underwater world .
And that diving with the filmmaking was connecting .
So intertwined , kind of , my two passions , something interesting happened .
At Abyss , around a narrative problem in this movie , to solve .
And that was , we had to sort of have created a liquid water system .
We took a computer @-@ generated animation .
CG : What was coming out of this was the first computer @-@ generated soft surface figure ever to be seen in a movie .
The film brought , though , no money .
It was exactly playing in the middle of its production costs .
But it was something fascinating .
It was the audience around the world that I noticed was hypnotized .
It was the magic that was thought to have been , according to Arthur Clarke &apos;s law , advanced technology and magic are no longer to be distinguished .
They saw , then , something magical .
And that was what I found incredibly exciting .
And I thought , &quot; Wow , that absolutely must be into the art of film .
So , we went to Terminator 2 , my next movie , a lot further .
Together with ILM , we created there the guy from liquid material , the success was hanging .
It was quite that .
AB : How this effect would arrive ?
And it worked .
Again , we had something magical created .
And the effect in the audience was the same .
But there we have with the film already a little bit more money .
We &apos;ve been recorded by these two experiences , and starting with this , we &apos;ve been able to achieve a whole new world .
A whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for filmmakers .
So , I started a company together with my good friend , Stan .
Winston , who was at that time the best make @-@ up and creature designer .
They were called Digital Domain .
They were the basic idea of this company , which was to start the phase of analog processes with optical printers , etc . , and to start digital productions in a moment .
This was what we did , and we managed to do it .
A while , we had a competitive advantage .
But in the mid @-@ 1990s , we realized that we had a Creature and Character Design , what we were doing , the company , which we actually founded .
And too slowly , we moved forward .
I had this piece of Avatar written , which is the bar in visual effects and visual computer @-@ generated effects across all the different heights , and it was going to be a bit too slow .
And with realistic , human , expressive characters that are made using CG .
And the main characters were going to be CG .
And the world was going to be CG .
But the bar pressed very much , very back .
And the people in my company , they told me that we were still not in the company for the time being , in a position to do that .
So , I shifted that , and I did this other movie about the big ship .
That goes down to the studio , I got that as Romeo and Juliet on a ship , and I sold it .
It became a love movie of epic proportions , a passionate film , secret .
But did I actually want to become a real wreck ?
The Titanic , dive down .
That &apos;s why I made the film .
That &apos;s the truth .
That studio knew that , but it didn &apos;t .
I have it , but I convinced it by saying , &quot; We dive to the wreck . &quot;
We film that real wreck .
We &apos;re going to do it in the opening sequence of the film .
That &apos;s enormous , important .
It &apos;s a good trailer for the marketing .
And I persuaded them to make an expedition to finance it .
Sounds crazy .
But that can be done back to the fact that your imagination , a reality , can create .
We created then actually six months . Six months later , a reality where I became a reality in a Russian submersible , four kilometers below the surface of the North Atlantic .
And I was really struck by the real Titanic through a bullet .
That was not a movie .
No HD .
That was real .
So , that got me really bypassed .
And the preparations for that were enormous .
We had to have cameras and headlights and everything else .
And I fell on how much I noticed these deep @-@ sea dive gears resembling a space mission .
Well , you were also high @-@ tech and needed more .
Planning : You go up into this capsule .
Then you float in this dark dark , hostile environment , where no hope for salvation is there .
If you do not , you don &apos;t , yourself , get back , and I thought , wow , that &apos;s the same as if I were in a science fiction movie .
That &apos;s real cool .
I was pretty obsessed .
I was obsessed with exploring the deep sea , at least the part that was interested in curiosity and science .
It was all .
It was adventure .
It was curiosity .
It was imagination .
And it was a real experience that I had not had Hollywood to give me .
Because , you know , I could get a creature to imagine for which we would then have a visual effect , and then I could create a visual effect .
But I could get no idea what that was that I was outside the window , and I could not imagine what I was going to see .
And for some of the expeditions that followed , I &apos;ve got to see creatures in thermal springs .
And sometimes things that I still see before , things I &apos;d never seen before , sometimes things that nobody had ever seen before .
And for those who have science to do at the time we saw it .
Still , no words found at all .
That &apos;s what made me really wrong .
And I wanted more .
And so I met , then , a slightly unusual decision .
After that success of Titanic , I said to myself , &quot; Okay , I want to be a film maker in Hollywood , and I &apos;m going to put full @-@ time researchers on ice for a while .
And then , we started these expeditions to plan .
We showed up to Bismarck and we explored them with robotic vehicles .
We returned to the wreck of the Titanic .
We took little robots , which we built , that were a fiberglass cable .
Our intention was to dive in and get inside of the ship and look at the inside of the ship .
What never before has been done .
Nobody had ever had the inside of the wreck explored .
You had still not had the means to do that .
So they developed the necessary technology .
So , what ?
And there I am now sitting on the deck .
The Titanic .
In a submersible boat , and I see planks planking these boards here that are quite similar .
And from those I know are those that once the band there played ,
And I fly with a little bit of robotic vehicle through the aisles of the ship .
I operate it , actually , only .
But my consciousness is within the body of the vehicle .
It felt like it was like it was physically inside the vehicle wreck of the Titanic ,
That was the surreal form of a déjà vu that I &apos;ve ever experienced .
Because before I was around one of the corners , I knew I &apos;d always know what was going to happen in the light cone of the vehicle .
And since I &apos;ve been running over the movie set for months , when we shot the film .
That set was actually a precise set copy of the blueprints of the ship .
That was , then , a very strange experience .
It made me this telepresence experience aware that you could have such robotic avatars .
And so , your own consciousness in that vehicle .
In that other form of existence , you can move it into the vehicle , it was really incredibly profound .
And maybe it was also a little bit of a view of what might be happening in a few decades .
If you could have cyborg bodies to do some research or other things , or do some other things .
In all sorts of post @-@ human future scenarios that I think I can imagine as a science fiction fan .
After these expeditions , we started doing what we were down there , what we had seen .
Really , we were learning to appreciate .
To learn , for example , these deep @-@ sea equals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals .
This is sort of alien .
But here on Earth .
They live with the help of chemosynthesis .
They exist not in a species that is sunlight .
They don &apos;t exist in a system .
They exist in a system that is based on sunlight . How do we do that ?
And so this is how you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees Celsius .
Hot water cloud .
And you can live . And you can &apos;t imagine they survive there .
To the same time , I was also very interested in space science .
That was again the science fiction influence .
From my childhood and so it ended up landing at people . They were interested in space .
And the people with NASA , at the same time , and at the NASA Expert Council , they were planning real space missions .
They &apos;re going to Russia , going through before the mission .
That biomedical protocol , and everything about it and everything flying around .
Then to the International Space Station , and they take our 3D camera systems .
That was fascinating .
But at the end of the day , it was that I was going to be a space scientist with us in the deep sea .
I was going to take them and I was going to give them access to the world .
And down there , astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were working on these extreme situations .
I was going to take them to the sources so they could look around , take samples and test instruments .
And so on .
We turned .
We did documentary films .
But actually science , more specifically space science , so the closing circle between my existence and my being a science fiction fan .
Back then , when I was a kid and I was a reality .
In the course of this discovery journey , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot about science , a lot .
But I learned a lot about science , too .
Now , think about leadership , I &apos;m sure a director must be able to lead .
A leader must be like a ship captain or something .
I understood , but I didn &apos;t understand much about leadership .
Before I started these expeditions , because I was on a certain point , I had to tell myself , &quot; What am I doing ? &quot;
Here .
Why is it that I do this ?
What &apos;s coming out of it ?
These stupid movies bring us no more money .
We play some of the production costs .
One of fame , no trace .
Everybody thinks , I &apos;m between Titanic and Avatar .
Walked away and would have somewhere else nails on a towel on a beach beach .
I &apos;ve all got these movies , these documentary films for a very small audience .
No fame , no honor .
No money .
What are you doing ?
You &apos;re doing it around the task for the sake of the challenge .
And the ocean is the most challenging environment that it has .
You &apos;re doing it of exploratory space .
And you &apos;re doing it because of the strange connection that emerges when a small group of people form a team .
Because we have all of this with just 10 to 12 percent people , who have been doing continuous cooperation for years .
Sometimes , we were two to three months in a row at sea .
And in this community , you can see that the most important thing is respect , respect , that you have for each other , because you &apos;re done a task that you can &apos;t explain to anyone else .
If you think about returning to land and saying , &quot; We had to do it . &quot;
That fiberglass , the sound attenuation .
And that &apos;s all around .
The whole technology .
And the difficulties , the human performance .
If you look at sea , you can do that to the other , you can &apos;t explain .
That &apos;s like working with policemen or policemen or soldiers who do something in common .
And you know they do never do it to explain anyone .
There &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
When I was back , I came back to my next movie , Avatar , and I tried to apply the same leadership style , which is that you respect your team and in return deserve respect .
And that made the dynamics really change .
And there I was again with the same little team , and I was on unknown terrain .
We turned Avatar with an innovative new technology , which it used to be , and it didn &apos;t exist before .
It was incredibly exciting .
It was a tremendous challenge .
And we got to work for a period of four and a half years to become a real family .
And that changed my way of making films .
It changed completely .
It changed people . They thought we had these ocean properties .
Yes .
Really ?
Good .
Tone .
And then , on the planet .
Pandora transports for me . It was more of a principled way to do my job .
The real process of doing this is , as a result , changing .
What can we do from all of this ?
What lessons do we learn ?
I think in the first place , the curiosity is .
It &apos;s the most powerful human property .
Our imagination is a force that is even a reality that creates a reality .
And the respect for your team is more important than all laurels .
This world to me comes with young filmmakers .
The people who say , &quot; Give me a advice . &quot;
How I like something like this can do this ?
And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t limit you . &quot;
Even a guy who &apos;s already getting someone else for you .
&quot; Do not do it . &quot;
&quot; Do it to yourself . Don &apos;t bet against yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
The NASA has this kind of favorite sentence .
&quot; Failure is not an alternative . &quot;
But in the arts and in the exploration , failure has to be an alternative .
Because there , it guarantees a positive benefit of trust .
No important undertaking , that &apos;s it .
Innovation demanded , has ever been achieved without risk .
You have to be ready .
Such risks on your own .
That &apos;s the idea that I thought to you with with on the way .
Failure is quite a way of thinking . Fear .
But is not one .
Thank you .
If I can tell you one thing today , it &apos;s not that the whole of the data that we consume is larger than the data that we consume , the sum of the pieces that you put in .
And instead of doing that , instead of thinking about overloading information , I want you to think about how we are information .
So , how we can use patterns to create patterns .
And we can use them to identify trends that otherwise have not become visible .
So , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical death chart based on age .
That program , which I &apos;m using here , is a little experiment .
It &apos;s called Pivot .
And what I &apos;m doing with Pivot is what I can do after a certain cause of death filter .
Say , accidents .
And immediately , I see another one pattern that &apos;s emerging , and that &apos;s because in the middle , here , people are most active .
And they &apos;re over here , most frail .
We can have a step further out and sort out the data .
Then , new and see that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects .
But not for everyone .
If we now go further and look at age , we say 40 years or younger or younger .
See , we see that accidents even become the main cause .
About the ones that people worry about , people should worry about , and who &apos;s looking at it further , it &apos;s particularly true for men .
They recognize , therefore , that the reputation of information and data in this way is very much swimming .
In a living information graph .
And if we remember this for raw data , why not ? Why not for content itself ?
What we &apos;re doing here is , what we have are the cover images of every single Sports Illustrated that have ever been printed .
It &apos;s all here .
It &apos;s all online .
It &apos;s all online . You can test it after my talk in your rooms .
With Pivot , you can dive into a decade .
You can dive in , into , for a certain year .
You can dive directly to , for a certain issue .
If I &apos;m here to look , I see the athletes , who are in this issue , and the sports .
I &apos;m a Lance Armstrong fan .
So click on here what makes me feel like all the issues that I see Lance Armstrong mentions .
Now , if I just look at a bigger picture , I could .
I think , OK , what ?
If I look at everything with the theme of cycling , so I go to a step back and expand the issues of cycling .
Now , I see Greg Lemon .
And so this is how you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , more targeted , wider , more pure , zoom out .
Then you look not for or surf .
You don &apos;t just surf .
You just do something that is actually a little different .
It &apos;s something in between .
And we think it changes the way that you do it , the way that information can be used .
I want to use this idea now a little bit further .
So , about what a little crazy is , what we &apos;re doing here is ,
We have every single wikipedia page taken , and put it on a little summary .
The summary contains a short overview of it and a symbol of the area from which it &apos;s coming .
I &apos;m just going to show you .
The top 500 of the most popular wikipedia pages .
But even in this limited view , you can see a lot of things we can do .
Immediately , we get a sense of what the issues are about Wikipedia on the most popular .
I &apos;m going to move on to government .
Now , after I &apos;ve elected government , I realize that the Wikipedia categories that are on the most cover are Time Magazines , people of the year .
This is really important .
Because this is a realization that is not in a single individual Wikipedia page .
This is just too recognizable .
If you want to go one step back and look at the whole thing , looking at one of these summaries , can I then go into the theme of Time Magazines , &quot; People of the Year , &quot; and see everybody together ?
If I &apos;m going to look at all these people , I realize that the majority of them are government officials .
Some of them come from science .
Some of them come from even less business .
Here &apos;s my boss .
And one comes from the music field .
And interestingly , Bono is also a TED Prize winner .
So you can now jump and jump and take a look at all the TED Prize winners .
Take a look at us , surf the web .
That &apos;s the first time it &apos;s as if it &apos;s really a web .
Not only from side to side . But a lot more abstract .
And so , I want to show you something else that a little surprise might be , you know ?
I &apos;m going to just show you the New York Times here , website .
Pivot .
These are the applications .
I want to do it not a browser .
They call it really not a browser .
But you can do websites with it .
And we bring these zoom technology to every single website , like this .
I can do a step back , and I can go straight to a specific section .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s important because you can only look through looking at websites in this way and in this way , all the Internet history is the same way of looking at it .
I can , therefore , go back into my course , zoom in in in a certain time frame .
Here &apos;s the state of the whole demonstration , which I &apos;ve been holding up to this point .
And I can sort of do everything I &apos;m doing today , what I &apos;ve seen .
Again , bring back .
And if I go back a step , and I go back and look at everything , I can rearrange my course , maybe after my search past .
Here &apos;s where I went looking for nepotistic .
Here &apos;s Bing , right ?
Here &apos;s live labs : Pivot .
And from here , I can go into the page .
And you can go back to it .
It &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s always coming to use .
And every time it does that , it makes the overall picture bigger than the sum of the data pieces .
In the moment , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
We talk about it . Curse of the abundance of information .
We talk about drowning in information .
What if we could get this situation going ?
And that Internet on the head . So we could turn this situation around , instead of always moving from one to the other .
From many things to many things to many things to many things .
And by doing this , we can see patterns that would otherwise have been hidden .
If we could do this , then it will be this data trap that we &apos;ve seen so far , maybe a new source of meaningful information .
And instead of just just looking at information , instead of just moving around , we can get knowledge from it .
And if we know , then then we can maybe even experience wisdom .
And we can learn from that , and I stop .
Thank you very much .
Everybody talks today about this happiness , right ?
I have some people who have the number of books counting .
And they &apos;ve published happiness in the title for the last five years , and they &apos;ve been giving up after about 40 .
And it was still a lot more .
It &apos;s got a huge wave of interest in happiness among the researchers .
It &apos;s got a lot of happiness coaching .
Everybody would like to see people happier .
But despite all of this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps that it has , so to speak , made it almost impossible .
Sure .
About happiness , thinking about happiness , and my talk .
Today , the main thing is that cognitive traps will act .
That &apos;s true for laymen who are talking about their own happiness .
And it &apos;s true for scientists who are talking about happiness because happiness turns out we &apos;re exactly the same mess as we are with everybody else .
The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity .
It turns out it &apos;s the same word happiness that &apos;s just not a useful word anymore .
Because we &apos;re putting it on too many different things .
I think it &apos;s a certain one meaning on which we apply it to , you know , a limited number of things .
But in the big picture , by and large , that &apos;s something that we &apos;re going to have to give up .
And we &apos;re going to take the complicated view .
That &apos;s what well @-@ being is .
That &apos;s the second case : Confusion between experience and memory .
In fact , it &apos;s between happiness , being happy .
In his life and being happy , being happy about his life or being happy with his life .
And that &apos;s two very different , very different concepts .
And they &apos;re both thrown together .
In the idea of happiness and happiness and the third is the concentration illusion .
And that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that the fact is that we don &apos;t think about one thing .
The well @-@ being affects without its meaning distorting .
I mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive trap .
It &apos;s just not a way .
It &apos;s right to get it right .
Now , I &apos;d like to talk to you about an example of someone who had a question and answer session .
After a one of my lectures , which told a story , it was unclear .
He said , he had a symphony heard .
And it was absolutely magnificent music .
And it was at the very end of the recording , there was a terrible , creeping sound .
And then he added , &quot; Really , quite emotional . &quot;
That &apos;s what all the experience ruined .
But that had it not , which it ruined .
The memories of the experience were . He had the experience .
He had 20 minutes of wonderful music .
They counted not because he had a great memory .
The memory was ruined and the memory was ruined , everything that he had to keep to was .
What we had really told is , what we were talking about ourselves and about other people is that we could think about ourselves .
In the sense of two kinds of self .
It &apos;s a living self that exists in the present , living in the present .
And the present knows how capable it is of rebuilding the past .
But in fact , only the present has it , it &apos;s the living self , the doctor instigates .
It &apos;s the living self that the doctor instigates . You know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Is it hurting now ? &quot;
When I ask you to touch you here , and then there &apos;s a memory self .
And that memory self is that memory self that &apos;s withering .
And the story of our lives , maintaining .
And it &apos;s that that that &apos;s the doctor &apos;s talking about by asking the question .
How did you feel in the last few days ?
Or how was your journey to the Albania ?
Or something like that ?
This is two very different units .
This living self .
And this remembering self .
And the two to be confused is part of the unity of the term &quot; happiness . &quot;
Now , the remembering self is a storyteller .
And that starts really with a real fundamental reaction to our own memories .
It starts immediately .
We tell not only stories .
When we think about it , stories become stories , our memory tells us stories .
That means what we &apos;re talking about from our experiences is what we &apos;re allowed to keep is a story .
And let &apos;s not forget about it with an example .
It &apos;s a old study .
That &apos;s real patients , who are one of the patients who undergo a painful procedure .
I &apos;m not going to go into detail .
You know , it &apos;s no longer painful today .
But you know , it was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
It became a request to do it every 60 seconds , every 60 seconds , about your pain .
And here &apos;s two patients .
That &apos;s your record .
And you &apos;re asked , who of both has more suffered from both ?
And that &apos;s a very simple one , really .
Patient B has clearly more suffered from this .
His intestinal reflection was longer .
And each minute of pain , the patient A had had had patient B and more and more .
But now there are a different one : How much did you think these patients thought they suffered ?
And here &apos;s a surprise .
And the surprise is that patient is patient A , much worse reminder of the intestinal reflection , than patient B had the stories of the intestinal reflections were different .
And because a very critical part of the story is how a very critical part of the story ends .
And no one of these stories is very edifical or great .
But one of them is this one that is clear .
But one of them is clear . Worse than the other one .
And the ones that are worse was the one where the pain was all at the end of its peak .
It &apos;s a bad story .
Where do we know that ?
Because we have these people after they &apos;re reflecting their intestinal reflections , and much later on , how bad was that ?
The whole thing , overall .
And they were a lot worse for A than for B than for B in memory .
Now , that &apos;s a direct conflict between the survivor himself , and the remembering .
Even from the perspective of the survivor himself , B clearly had a worse time .
Now , what you do with patient A was , you know ?
And we have actually clinical experiments .
And it &apos;s done .
And it works .
You could actually do the intestinal reflection of patient A by extending it simply by just putting the tube inside .
Without going too much into it , too much .
That &apos;s going to make it happen that the patient suffers , but only a little bit less than before .
And if you do that a few minutes , you have a few effects on the effect that the living self of patient A gets worse off .
And you have a effect on the memory self of patient , patient A , getting much better off .
Because now , you have patient A , getting a better story about your experience .
What makes you draw a story from ?
And that &apos;s true of the stories that the memory tells us .
And it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent . And that &apos;s why a story is unique .
Breaks , significant moments and ends end are very , very important .
And in this case , the dominant end was the end .
Now , the living self lives its life continuously .
It has moments of experience , a moment after moment .
And they ask what happens to the living moments ?
And the answer is really simple :
They &apos;re for ever lost .
I mean , most moments of our life .
And I have that calculated . They know , the psychological presence is considered to be about three seconds long .
What does knowledge mean ? Do you know that in a life it &apos;s about 600 million of them .
In a month , there &apos;s about 600 000 .
The majority of them leave no left with any trace .
The majority of them will be completely ignored , by the memory self .
And yet , they somehow get the impression that they count , they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience .
Our lives are it . It &apos;s the limited resource that we consume .
While we &apos;re on this world , and how we use it , it would seem to be important .
But that &apos;s not the story . That &apos;s the memory self for us that keeps .
So , we have the memory self .
And that living self .
And they are really pretty different .
The biggest difference between them is that they deal with time , from the point of view of the living .
Even if they do a vacation , and they have the second week just as good , as the first week .
Then there &apos;s the two @-@ week vacation twice as good as the one @-@ week vacation .
So that &apos;s how it doesn &apos;t work at all .
It doesn &apos;t work for the memory self , for the memory self , a two @-@ week vacation .
Hardly better than the one @-@ week holiday .
Because there &apos;s no new memories added to that .
You &apos;ve got the story changed .
And on those terms , time is actually the critical variable . It &apos;s a memory self that distinguishes itself from a living self , has time .
Very little influence on that story .
Now , the memory self makes more than just remembering and remembering stories .
It &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions .
Because if you make a patient , he or she has a patient who , let &apos;s say , has two spreadsheets of two different .
Surgeons had and had decided which one he or she should choose .
Then it &apos;s the one who chooses who chooses who has the memory , who &apos;s less bad .
And that &apos;s the surgeon who &apos;s chosen to be .
That survivor himself has no voice .
In this election , actually , we don &apos;t choose between experiences .
We choose between memories of experiences , and even experiences .
If we think about the future , we think about our memories of experiences .
Normally not as experiences .
We think about our future , about our foreseeable memories .
And in fact , they can do that .
You know , as a tyranny of remembering self .
And you can do that remembering memorization yourself .
When one is , kind of , the living self dragging through experiences that the living self doesn &apos;t need .
I have the impression that if you think about vacation , that &apos;s very often the case , that means .
We make vacation as much as possible at the service of the remembering self .
And that &apos;s a little hard , to justify , I think .
I mean , how much do we feed on our memories ?
That &apos;s a one of the explanations that are used for dominating the remembering self .
And if I talk about that , I think about a vacation that we &apos;re going to spend a few years ago in Antarctica , which is clearly the best vacation we &apos;ve ever had in Antarctica that I &apos;ve ever had .
And I think relatively often about that in relation to how much time I think about other vacations , in relation to that .
And I &apos;ve probably heard about my memories of these three @-@ week trips .
I would say something like 25 minutes for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
Now , if I ever had the folder opened , with the 600 images in it , I would have another hour spent .
Now , these are three weeks .
And that &apos;s at most one and a half hours .
There seems to be disagreement there .
Now , I like a little bit extreme .
You know , in that , how little appetite I have for feeding memories ?
But even if you have more of that , there &apos;s a real question .
Why are we giving memories so much weight ?
In the scourge of weight , the weight that we give experiences .
So I want me to tell you about a thought experiment .
So , imagine your next vacation .
You know that on the end of your vacation , all your pictures are destroyed .
And you get a amnesty drug . So you get yourself an amnesty drug , so you don &apos;t remember anything .
Now , you would have the same vacation .
And if you had another vacation , you would have a different vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two kinds of self .
And you have to think about how you &apos;re going to decide this conflict .
And that &apos;s really , really not obvious at all .
Because if you &apos;re going to be in the sense of time , you get an answer .
And if you &apos;re in the sense of memory , you could think of another answer , you could get a different one .
Why we &apos;re going to choose the vacations we choose ?
A problem that &apos;s going to confront us with a choice between the two species of the self .
Now , the two types of self are throwing two terms from happiness :
It &apos;s actually two concepts of happiness : The ones we apply to happiness .
One per self .
They can , therefore , ask how happy is the living self ?
And then they would ask , how happy are the moments of happiness in the life of the living being ?
Even and they are all happiness . For moments .
Is a pretty complicated process ?
Which are the emotions ?
The ones that can be measured ?
And by the way , we are now able to have a pretty good idea .
From happiness of the living self to happiness over time , when they &apos;re lucky after happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
That &apos;s not about how happy it is .
A person lives .
It &apos;s about how satisfied or how pleased it is .
The person is when this person is informed about his life , very different terms .
Everybody who thinks about these terms doesn &apos;t differentiate will study the study of happiness .
And I belong to a lot of happiness researchers , about well @-@ being , who are researching happiness long masking the study .
On the exact .
These are the ways that differentiate between happiness , happiness , happiness , the living self , and happiness , memory self .
In fact , in recent years , it has been recognized , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separately .
The Gallup Organization has a global organization survey of the number of people in the world , where more than half a million people have been asked questions .
And what they &apos;re asking about their lives and their lives and their experiences ?
And it was other efforts that were made in that direction .
In the last few years , we &apos;ve started to think about happiness in the two species of self , learning about self .
And the main lesson that we have , I think , learned is that they really really differ .
They can know how satisfied someone is with their lives .
And that teaches them really , really doesn &apos;t teach them much about how happy he lives his life .
And vice versa .
Only to give you an idea of the correlation to the correlation that correlation is .
About five percent of what that means is that if you want to meet someone and you would meet them , you would tell them , &quot; Oh , his father is a two @-@ meter man . How much ? &quot;
Would you know about his size , right ?
Well , you would know something about his size .
But it &apos;s got a lot of uncertainty .
You have that much uncertainty .
If I give you a message that somebody has his life as eight on a scale of 10 , classified as eight .
Have you got a lot of uncertainty about how happy ?
He &apos;s with his survivor .
Even the correlation is , therefore , low .
We know something about what the correlation is about happiness self happiness .
We know that money is very important , very important .
Targets are very important .
We know that happiness is essentially about happiness , being satisfied with people who we like , time to spend .
With people who we like , it &apos;s other pleasure .
But that &apos;s dominant .
If you &apos;re going to be lucky for the two kinds of self , then you want to maximize it .
Will you be at the end of the day doing very different things ?
The conclusion from the conclusion of what I said here is that what we &apos;re lucky about is really not supposed to imagine as a substitute for well @-@ being .
It &apos;s a complete different term , right ?
Well , very briefly .
A different reason for that is why we don &apos;t know clearly about happiness is that happiness is not something we &apos;re not thinking about .
If we think about life , we &apos;re thinking about life , and if we actually live , if you ask the simple question of how happy people in California are , will they not be the correct answer ?
If they &apos;re asking that question , think that the people are in California happier than they are ?
If they say , &quot; We in Ohio live , and what happened is that if they talk about life in Ohio , when they think about life in California , they think about the difference between California and other places . &quot;
And this difference is , say , in climate .
Now , it turns out that it &apos;s climate not very important for climate to the living self .
And it &apos;s not even very important , even for the thoughtful .
Even that decides how happy people are . Well .
But because that thoughtful self is responsible , the thoughtful self can eventually lead some people to be .
AM : End up moving to California , and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track .
What happens to people who are looking for California ?
In the hope of being happier , well , their self @-@ being becomes alive .
Not happier . We know that .
But one thing is going to happen .
You &apos;re going to think you &apos;re happier .
Because if you talk about that , you &apos;re reminded of it , how horrible the weather is in Ohio .
And you &apos;re going to feel you &apos;re the right choice .
It &apos;s very difficult , clear about well @-@ being .
And I hope I have you , I have an idea of how difficult it is to think about it .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
I have a question for you .
You &apos;re very grateful .
Well , when we started thinking a few weeks ago , when we were talking to me , you told me that it was a pretty interesting result that came from this Gallup survey , is that something that you &apos;re able to share with us ?
Because you &apos;re now going to have a few minutes left .
Daniel Kahneman : Sure .
I think that &apos;s the most interesting result we have in the Gallup survey . It &apos;s a number that we absolutely cannot find .
We found that in terms of the number of happiness of the survivor himself .
If we look at how feelings are connected to income , what we see is that there are different feelings among a income of 60 000 under an income of 60,000 dollars a year for Americans .
And that &apos;s a very large , big sample of Americans .
About 600 000 .
But it &apos;s a big representative . It &apos;s a sample of income below 600 000 dollars in a year .
CA : 60,000 .
DK : 60,000 , 60,000 dollars . In a year , the people are unhappy .
And they &apos;re getting increasingly unhappy .
JE : The poorer they get about that , we get an absolutely flat line .
I mean , I rarely think I have such flat lines seen .
What happens is obviously that money is giving you no experience of happiness .
But that lack of money gives you a certain amount of misery , and we can get this misery very , very clearly measured .
In the sense of the other , even the remembering self , you get a different story .
The more money you make , the more satisfied you are .
That &apos;s not true of emotions .
CA : But Danny , throughout the American endeavor , it &apos;s about life .
Freedom , the aspiration for happiness .
If people want to be serious about this finding , I mean , it all seems to be upside down .
Everything that we believe to be , for example , in tax policy .
And so on and so forth , there &apos;s an opportunity for politicians to see that the country generally has a finding like the seriousness .
And that &apos;s based on that , would make politics . DK : You know ?
I think that it &apos;s recognition .
For those roles of gambling research in the politics that are recognition , recognition will be slow .
In the United States , no question .
But in the United Kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now .
And in others , it &apos;s happening right now .
The people are in the process of recognizing that they think of happiness .
If they think about politics , it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they &apos;re going to explore experience happiness , or whether they want to explore life assessment .
So , we need to really have this discussion very soon , how to increase happiness , very different things go .
Depending on how you think and how you think about it , and whether you think about the memory self , or whether you think about the living self .
That &apos;s what will influence politics .
Think about it in the years ahead , in the United States , you &apos;re tightening up on the happiness of the people to experience .
That &apos;s going to , I think , be the next one or two decades , part of the national statistics .
CA : Well , it seems to me that this topic is going to , or should , at least be the most interesting political debate to follow over the next few years .
Thank you very much .
For the invention of behavioral economics .
Thank you .
Danny Kahneman : Today I &apos;m speaking to you about energy and climate .
And that &apos;s perhaps a little surprising .
Because it &apos;s my full @-@ time job at the foundation that &apos;s mainly about vaccines and seeds , about the things we invent and deliver , to make the poorest two billion .
A better life for us .
But energy and climate are extremely extreme , very important .
For these people , in fact , even more important than for anyone else on the planet .
Climate degradation means that their seeds are above all the seeds that will not grow for many years , we are too much or too little rain .
The things will change that way . Their fragile nature will change as it cannot sustain .
That leads to starvation .
It leads to insecurity .
It leads to unrest .
So it becomes climate change terrible for them , you know .
It &apos;s also the energy price for them that matters very much .
The fact is , if you only talk about one thing , the price could be reduced to poverty reduction , energy would be by far the most effective .
Now , the energy price is above time gone .
In fact , the progress society is based on energy advances that drove coal evolution .
The industrial revolution , and even the industrial revolution in the 20th century , there was a rapid fall in the electricity price .
And that &apos;s why we have refrigerators .
Air conditioning . We can make modern materials .
And so many things do .
We &apos;re in the electricity price . We &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
But if we do the price reduction , we let ourselves be reduced by half , we hit a new barrier , and we &apos;re going to start to see the price cut .
And these barrier hangs on CO2 , and CO2 warms up , and the planet and the equation for CO2 is .
Actually , quite clear .
It Summons .
That emitted .
CO2
Which one to increase temperature ?
And that increase in temperature has some very negative effects , effects on the weather .
And maybe worse , indirect effects , that the natural ecosystems are changing so rapidly , such rapid changes , can &apos;t adapt .
And so whole systems collapse .
Now , the exact link between a rise in CO2 and the resulting temperature change , and where they have further consequences .
Because there are some ambiguities .
But not very many .
And there are certainly ambiguities about that , how bad these consequences will be .
But they will be extremely bad .
I have the top scientists asked several times , &quot; Do we really have to get down to near zero ? &quot;
Is it not enough to half or a quarter ?
The answer is , until we get near zero .
Will the temperature keep rising ?
That &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
It &apos;s quite different from what it &apos;s to say .
We have a three and a half feet truck that &apos;s under a three @-@ meter bridge .
Come on , it &apos;s what you can do , squeeze it down below .
That &apos;s what you have to do , down to zero .
Now , we hit zero every year a lot of carbon dioxide , over 26 billion tons .
Everybody in America , about 20 tons of people from poor countries , less than one on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone , on the planet .
And somehow , we need to make changes that make this to zero .
It &apos;s been constant up to now .
Only different economic ones .
Changes have made it affect at all .
And we need to be affected by rapid growth to reduction and to a reduction to a reduction to zero .
These equations have four factors : One , a bit of multiplication .
They have this thing on the left , CO2 , that they bring to zero .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be done by the number of people , by the services that every human being uses on average , the average energy for every service , and the CO2 emitted per unit of energy .
Let &apos;s let &apos;s therefore take every factor individually .
And think about how we can do that to zero .
Probably , a factor of these numbers has to be very close to zero .
Now , this is basic algebra .
But let &apos;s go ahead and go through it .
First of all , we have the population today .
Six to eight billion people .
And it &apos;s going to reach nine billion , which is going to nine billion .
If we &apos;re very successful in new vaccines , healthcare and new reproductive medicine .
Could we do that , maybe by 10 to 15 percent ?
But to date , we &apos;re seeing a climb of 1.3 percent .
The second factor is the services .
That includes all of the food , the food we eat , clothing , television , heating .
That &apos;s very good things .
And poverty reduction means these services almost to everybody on the planet accessible to everyone .
It &apos;s great that these numbers are rising up in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might think we could make cuts and use less .
But in average , this number is going to increase every year , and so overall , it &apos;s more than doubling .
The number of services that are available per person per person .
Here &apos;s what we see is a very basic service .
Is there a home light to light up so you can read the homework ?
And these students have it not .
So , they go out and read .
Their school responsibilities under the street light .
Now , effectiveness , the E , the energy per service gives you finally good news .
We have something that &apos;s not going up .
Because of different successes in the lighting sector , through other types of cars , through new building methods .
It &apos;s got a lot of services that you &apos;re able to drastically reduce your energy consumption , and drastically reduce it .
103 : 00 , 05 : 50 , 000 GT , 00 : 05 , 53 : 000 .
Some services leave you with 90 percent reduction .
Some individual services leave you with 90 percent reduction .
In others , services like manufacturing , manufacturing , fertilizers , 105 : 00 , 05 : 56 , 000 GT , 00 : 05 , 58 : 000 , air transport or air transport , the room for improvement is much smaller .
Overall , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a reduction of maybe one factor three or maybe even a factor three , or maybe even six .
But in the first three factors , the first three are now 26 billion to maybe the very best .
Thirteen billion tons went .
And that &apos;s just not enough .
Look at the first three factors , the fourth factor .
And this one will be a key factor .
That &apos;s the amount of CO2 that &apos;s per unit of energy emitted .
It represents a rise in the question of whether you can do that to zero .
If you &apos;re burning coal , no , if you &apos;re burning natural gas , no , almost every method of producing electricity emits .
Nowadays , CO2 , except renewable energy , nuclear energy .
So what we &apos;re doing on a global scale has to be a new system to create , right ?
We need energy under .
If I &apos;m going to use the term &quot; wonder , &quot; I don &apos;t mean the impossible , the microprocessor is .
A miracle , the PC is a miracle .
That Internet and its services are a miracle ,
That people here have to say , to develop many of those miracles .
Normally , there are no deadline for you to do a miracle , up to a certain date .
Normally , you &apos;re just standing next to it .
And some people come not .
In this case , we have to do full gas , and a miracle in very short time , but we have to do it .
Now , I wondered , how can I do that really ?
Is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that shows the idea of people here , that &apos;s what &apos;s happening ?
I remembered , I remember last year .
When I was bringing mosquitos and somehow liked mosquitos , people liked that .
The idea became for them really , really tangible .
You know , it was people who were with mosquitos living with mosquitos for energy , and I noticed this .
I decided that this was the release of fireflies this year &apos;s contribution to the environment here , would be here .
This is where there are some natural fireflies .
You have me assured me that they &apos;re not biting .
In fact , they &apos;re probably not even going to leave the glass .
Now , there are all kinds of game solutions like this .
But they bring all of them not much .
We need solutions .
Either one or more of them , which are an unimaginable scale and unimaginable reliability .
And though it has many directions , in which people are looking for it , I really only see five of them looking for these big challenges .
I have tides , geothermal fusion and biofuels omitted .
These are perhaps doing a moderate contribution .
And if you do better than you do , I expect that would be great .
But my key message here is that we are working on all those five .
And we can &apos;t do any of them because they give up because they intimidate us .
Because everybody has significant problems .
Look at them first . We &apos;re burning .
Fossil fuels . Burning of either the coal or the natural gas .
What you &apos;re doing there seems to be easy .
But that &apos;s it .
You &apos;d have to take all the CO2 that &apos;s coming out of the chimney after you burn it .
You &apos;d have to condense under pressure .
And then somewhere somewhere , and hope that it &apos;s there to stay .
It &apos;s got some pilot projects that are going to do this at a 60 @-@ 80 level .
But it &apos;s going to get to 100 , and it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get an agreement on the storage of CO2 is a big challenge .
But that &apos;s the biggest problem .
Here &apos;s the question of storage time .
Who &apos;s going to make sure ?
Who can make sure something is guaranteed ?
What literally many billions of times larger than any species of food waste , you &apos;re looking at nuclear and other nuclear and other things .
That &apos;s a lot of volume .
That &apos;s so , it &apos;s a hard nut .
When I go next , nuclear energy -- it also has three major problems .
The cost before all , especially in highly regulated countries , is high .
The question of safety is that you really feel that nothing is wrong .
Despite the human collaboration , that the fuel is not for weapons , that fuel is not used .
And what does you do then ?
With the waste ?
Because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concern .
The people have to worry about it well .
184 : 00 10 20 000 GT 00 10 25 000 000 .
So three , very difficult problems , which might be solvable .
So three , very difficult problems , which might be solvable .
And at which you can work , therefore , the last three of the five have .
I &apos;ll summarize .
It &apos;s the renewable energy .
How you often call it , and also the ones have , although it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need fuel .
You have some disadvantages to it . One is .
The energy density that these technologies generate dramatically , dramatically lower than the power plants .
That &apos;s low @-@ energy .
You talk about many square kilometers , thousands of times more space than a normal power plant .
And you also talk about interruptions .
The sun shines not the whole thing all day .
It shines also not every day , not every day .
And just as we have the wind , not always blowing .
So that &apos;s why , if you &apos;re from these sources , you have to have a way to use energy even in times .
If you &apos;re not available , if it &apos;s not available , you get it .
It &apos;s here , so there &apos;s big price challenges .
It &apos;s there . There &apos;s challenges in transmission .
If we , for example , say that the energy source outside the country is not , you don &apos;t just need technology .
You need to also use the risk to run the energy risk from where else comes from .
And it &apos;s there , the storage problem .
And to do that , to show the dimension , I &apos;ve looked at all kinds of batteries that are manufactured , which are used for cars , computers , mobile phones , flashlights for everything .
And that &apos;s what I did with the amount of electronic energy that the world uses , compared to the amount of electronic energy that it uses .
I found out that all batteries are the batteries that we &apos;re now producing , less than 10 minutes of total energy storage .
Could we need to do this ? Well , we need a big breakthrough .
Something that , to do a factor 100 , will be better than the approaches .
So right now , this is not impossible .
But it &apos;s not that easy .
This is what happens when you try to find these interrupted sources , say , 20 , 30 percent of consumption .
If you look around 100 percent at that , you need to have an incredible miracle battery .
Now where are we going to go ?
What is the right approach ?
A Manhattan project .
How do we get to the finish ?
What we need is a lot of companies that are working on it .
Hundreds of people in each of these five areas need at least 100 people .
At many , they will say , &quot; They &apos;re crazy . &quot;
That &apos;s good .
I think here in the TED , I think there are lots of people who are already engaged in this .
Bill Gross has several companies under the TED group , one of them called Esolar .
The great ones .
Solar thermal technologies have Vinod .
Khosla is investing in dozens of companies .
The great things are doing and interesting opportunities have .
And I &apos;m trying to support that .
Nathan Myhrvold :
And I &apos;m funding a company that might surprisingly , surprisingly , be pursuing the nuclear approach .
It &apos;s got some innovations in the nuclear field : Modular , liquid , that &apos;s what development has .
In this industry , a while ago , so it stopped , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are lying around , and the Terrapower concept means that instead of a part of the uranium , one percent , you &apos;re going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be the U235 .
We decided to take the 99 percent to burn .
That U238 .
That &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
But actually , you had about it for a long time .
But you could never make reasonable simulations .
Whether it worked would work , but since it became modern supercomputers .
Can you do it simulate ?
And you can see that yes , with the right approach to materials , it looks like it works , and because you &apos;re burning these 99 % , it &apos;s like it &apos;s working .
That cost profile , much better .
In fact , you &apos;re burning the garbage , and you can even burn the garbage from today &apos;s reactors as a drive .
Instead of getting over the head , you &apos;re burning it , just burning it , a great thing .
That uranium is gradually consumed .
A little bit like a candle .
You can see that it &apos;s kind of a column .
It &apos;s often a migratory wave called a reactor , which really solves the fuel problem .
Here &apos;s a picture of a place in Kentucky .
This is the waste .
This is the 99 .
You have the part of the one that &apos;s burned today .
You have taken it out .
So it says , &quot; depleted uranium . &quot;
That drives the U.U. &apos; s for hundreds of years to come .
And if you want to buy ocean water cheaply and simply filter , you get enough fuel .
For the rest of the planet &apos;s life .
You know , there &apos;s still a lot of challenges .
But it &apos;s a case of example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward , hundreds of concepts .
Think about it , how do we make our success measured ?
How should our testimony look ?
Well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to achieve .
And then talk about the goal , the intermediate step .
A lot of people talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
It &apos;s really , really important that we get there , the rest of the 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still something agriculture .
Hopefully , forest threats and cement will be clean by then .
So , to get this 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like China , needs to completely transform their generation of electricity .
The other note says whether we can change zero emissions technology . Whether they &apos;re in all developed countries , whether they &apos;re in use .
And we , on the way , are going to get them to the rest .
That &apos;s great .
That &apos;s going to be a key element .
This certificate , if we get from there , when we go back .
How should that be a 2020 certificate ?
It should be the two elements again .
We should be the ones that use the effectiveness measures to get reduction going .
The less we emit , the less we emit , the lower the amount of CO2 .
And so , too , the temperature .
But actually , this note is for the things that we do . The things that we don &apos;t do completely , which lead to the big reductions .
Only the same , or even a little less .
Important , like the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
These breakthroughs need to be fully gas @-@ tracked .
And that can be measured .
In company numbers , in pilot projects and regulatory changes .
It &apos;s got a lot of great books on this subject , Al Gore &apos;s book .
We have the choice and David has McKay &apos;s Sustainable Energy .
Without the Hot Air , you go there . You really go through it and create a framework in which this is widely discussed .
Because we need to have support from everybody to do that .
It &apos;s got some things that have to come together .
That &apos;s a wish .
It &apos;s a very concrete wish that we can invent this technology .
If you tell me just one wish for the next 50 or so years .
I could give the president a choice : A vaccine .
And that &apos;s what I love .
Or I could choose that wish .
The one is halved energy price without CO2 is invented .
That wish would be what I would take . This one has the greatest impact .
If we take that wish , we will not get the gap between the long @-@ term and the short @-@ term thinking people .
Between the United States and China , between the poor and rich countries , and almost all lives .
This 2 billion is going to be much worse .
What do we need to do ?
For what measures , I appeal for ?
We need to work for more research funding .
If countries are to be in places like Koppenhagen , they should not only be talking about CO2 .
They should be talking about this innovation strategy .
And they would be shocked by the ridiculous .
Low money , which is used for these innovative approaches .
We need market incentives . We need carbon taxes . CAP .
Amp ; Trade . Something that sends a price signal .
We need to get the message across .
We need dialogue , rational and complete . And we also need to do the things that the government is doing .
It &apos;s a very important wish .
But I think we can do it .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you very much . Just to get a little better at understanding Terrapower .
First of all , you can give us an idea of the scale of this investment .
Bill Gates : To simulate the simulation on a supercomputer .
Everybody big scientists to get what they &apos;re doing , what we need is just a few 10 million .
And even if we &apos;re using our materials in a Russian reactor to test our materials to make sure it works reasonably .
Is it just in the &apos; 100s that you &apos;re tough ?
Step is that building the first one reactor , another billion , you find .
The regulations and the place of the actual place that &apos;s the first one to build .
Once the first one is finished , when it &apos;s running the way it promised , everything is very clear .
Because the economy , the energy density , is so different from nuclear energy as we are .
It &apos;s known .
CA : So , to understand that correctly .
That means deep into the ground .
Almost like a vertical column of nuclear fuel .
This one used uranium , and then the process starts at the top and continues to work .
After the bottom .
BG : Exactly .
Today , you have to always build the reactor .
So there &apos;s a lot of people and lots of controls that go wrong .
This thing , where you open it and things in or inside it or out .
This is not good .
If you do , however , you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years .
Think about it . A column that you bury without the need to cover all the complexities .
And it sits there and it burns .
60 years ,
And then it &apos;s done .
CA : A nuclear reactor that itself has a solution to the garbage .
BG : Yeah .
Now , what about the garbage that happens ?
You can do it sit .
It &apos;s got much less garbage .
It &apos;s a method that you use , and then you take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it further .
And we start by starting by putting the garbage that &apos;s already in existence , which is in these refrigerators or dry tanks at the reactors .
That &apos;s our starting fuel .
So that &apos;s what we think about these reactors as a problem .
That &apos;s what we think about in our fill , and that &apos;s dramatically reducing the garbage volume .
While this process is going on .
CA : But as you go through different people around the world about these possibilities , you &apos;ve been talking about them .
Where is that biggest interest ?
So what &apos;s really going to happen ?
BG : Well , we &apos;ve got no time yet to get stuck in one place .
And it &apos;s a lot of interesting disclosure rules for everything .
That nuclear in the name is wearing it . There &apos;s a lot of interest .
And the people of the company were in Russia , India , China .
I was here , and I have the Energy Minister , and I &apos;ve been talking about how this fits into the energy agenda .
I &apos;m optimistic .
You know , the French and the Japanese have something in their direction .
This is a variant of one thing .
The one that was done is a very important step forward .
But it &apos;s like a quick @-@ reactor .
And some countries have these built these .
That &apos;s why anyone who &apos;s building a quick reactor is .
It &apos;s a candidature for our first one .
CA : In your imagination , timeframe and probability .
So this is really what you want to create .
BG : Well , we need one of these scalable , power generating things that is very cheap .
We have 20 years to invent .
And then 20 years to deploy .
That &apos;s kind of the deadline , which is the environmental models that have shown us that we have to meet .
And you know , Terrapower , if everything goes well .
And that &apos;s a big wish .
Could that be easy ?
And fortunately , there are dozens of people today , and we need hundreds , which are as if their approaches work .
The promotion of their pilots works . For that .
It can be competitive , and it would be best .
If it were able to do several , because then you could use a mix .
On any case , we need a solution .
CA : Concerning the big , possible breakthroughs , this is the biggest thing you know .
BG : An energy break is the most important thing .
That would be it without the energy challenge .
But the power is still doing that much more , much more importantly , in the nuclear sector .
Is there any other innovative ?
Companies ?
Do you know , we know their work not so well as this ?
But it &apos;s the modular method that exists .
That &apos;s a different approach .
It &apos;s a liquid reactor type that has a little bit of difficulty .
But maybe you &apos;re saying that about us .
And so there &apos;s different ones .
But that &apos;s nice about it is that a uranium molecule , a million times as much energy as a say , has a carbon molecule .
And that &apos;s why , if you &apos;re dealing with the problems and they &apos;re mainly the radiation of the footprint .
And the cost is that the potential is there .
So , the impact on the country and others , almost all in one &apos;s own league .
CA : If that doesn &apos;t work , what do we have to do is take emergency measures to try and stabilize the Earth &apos;s temperature ?
BG : If you &apos;re in this situation , it &apos;s like it &apos;s like you &apos;re eating too much .
And for a moment before a heart attack , what do you do ?
Then ...
You need , maybe , a heart surgery or something like that .
It &apos;s got a research that &apos;s going on called geoengineering , which is going to look at different techniques to prevent warming , so we can 20 or 30 years longer get to get together .
That &apos;s just one insurance method .
You hope that we can &apos;t do that .
Some people say you should even do it , not just at insurance , because you can &apos;t do it lazy , so you can eat on , because you know you can eat heart surgery , you can save you .
I know not whether that &apos;s smart . If you look at the importance of this problem before you realize it .
But it &apos;s now a discourse that we have in geoengineering about whether to do that at your disposal .
If the things get faster or faster , or this innovation takes longer than we expect .
CA : Climate skeptics , do you have one or two sentences ?
For the ones around you , maybe to convince you .
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
Those who have scientific arguments are the very few .
Say , they say it has negative effects that are associated with clouds .
The things shift .
It &apos;s very , very few things that you even say . Of which there &apos;s a chance , in a very , very few millions .
That &apos;s the main problem here , like the AIDS problem .
You make the mistake .
Now , and you pay very much for it much later .
And that &apos;s why the idea is now .
If you want to take all kinds of urgent problems into something to invest in that you &apos;re not going to have what you have until later , and then the investment doesn &apos;t get so clear .
In fact , the IPCC Report is not necessarily .
That &apos;s the worst scenario .
And it &apos;s people in the world of rich people who are in the IPCC and they &apos;re saying , &quot; Okay .
That &apos;s not a big drama .
It &apos;s the fact that this uncertainty gives us cause for concern .
But my dream here is that this is that if you look at it economically and at the same time eliminate CO2 .
Then you also say , &quot; Skeptics . &quot;
Okay .
It &apos;s interesting to me not that it doesn &apos;t emit CO2 .
I wish it almost did , that it did .
But I &apos;m going to accept it , because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method , probably .
CA : And that would be your answer to Björn Lomborg . Argument that if you were to use all of this time and energy to do CO2 problem , if you were to solve it , you would have to do it .
All of the other goals , including those of poverty reduction , are suffering .
The fight against malaria and so on and so on , that it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources .
Money for it to invest while it &apos;s better things , the things we can do .
BG : Well , actual spending on the research is , let &apos;s say , the U.S. should .
Ten billion per year .
More spending than you spend today .
That &apos;s not the dramatic thing .
It should be other things that should not suffer .
You come along , you get big amounts of money .
And here you can have reasonable people contradictory .
If you do have something that &apos;s not economically sound and you try to finance it .
For me , this is what &apos;s happening .
The majority of waste .
It &apos;s unless you &apos;re very , very close to a breakthrough in cost , and you only fund the learning curve .
I think we should do more things , try and do the potential .
Very much cheaper to be .
If the swab is the one you get , a very high energy price .
Then you can only get the rich to keep up .
I mean , each of us here could have five times as much for our energy , spend without having to live his lifestyle .
For the lower two billion .
But is it a disaster ?
And even Lomborg thinks about his own new mesh , &quot; Is it now ? Why is research no longer being discussed ? &quot;
He &apos;s always being discussed because of his earlier stories with the skeptic camp .
But he has understood that this is one very lonely group , and he &apos;s a very lonely group .
And that &apos;s why he &apos;s now bringing the research argument .
And that &apos;s a thought that he &apos;s advocating for me , and I think it &apos;s appropriate .
The research , it &apos;s just crazy .
How little the research is supported ?
CA : Bill .
I think I &apos;m speaking for almost everybody .
If I say , &quot; I really hope that your wish is going to come true . &quot;
Thank you very much .
BG : Thank you .
I would like to give you a little bit of a talk .
What I want to tell you a few months ago when I wrote an article for Italian .
Wired noticed that I noticed when I wrote , I always used to use my synonymous dictionary .
But I was with the editing of the text , I was done .
And I noticed that I was doing something I &apos;ve never seen in my life .
What that word hinders really means , &quot; I read you the entry , disabled , adjective , crippled . &quot;
Helpless , useless , destroyed .
Deceased , mutilated , wounded , prepared .
Hum , separated , preserved , deserved , weakened , impotent , castrated , paralyzed .
Gehandicapt : Senil : Age @-@ weak , withdrawn , repaired , done , broken .
Gehnstlest.gegegest.gegetrust , counted ( see also : Injured )
Unemployment and weak
Anonyme : Healthy , strong
@ efficient
I have these lists for a friend according to my reading and I had to laugh first .
It worked like this ridiculous .
But I came only until I was prepared and couldn &apos;t do any more talking and had to stop reading .
And I first collected , after this assaulted flood of words and the associated emotional .
Shock .
Of course , this was a frayed old synonym dictionary .
I have become just wondering that I was going to have a pretty old edition .
But actually , it was an issue on the early &apos; 80s .
When I was just talking to primary school and started doing this , my self @-@ image started .
Outside my family environment , and building and shaping it .
Also in terms of other kids , and in terms of the rest of the world around me .
And God be thankfully , I have at that time not used a synonymous dictionary , if I were to take this entry seriously .
Would I be into a world where I was born that someone like me as a person would perceive as a person whose life in no way could be positive ?
Today , however , I am going to vote for the opportunities and adventures I have experienced .
I &apos;m celebrating , so I immediately celebrated the online edition of 2009 , and I expected that I would be here to find a more appealing contribution .
Here &apos;s the updated version .
This entry , unfortunately , is not much better .
In particular , I &apos;m shocked by the last two words under Near Anonyms .
Very much healthy .
But it &apos;s not just about the issue of the words .
It &apos;s about what we &apos;re talking about about people , the people we think about with these words .
It &apos;s about the values , the values that are in those words , and how we describe these values .
Our language influences our thinking .
And how we design the world and the people around us .
A lot of ancient societies , including Greeks and Greeks and Romans , really believed that we could have a curse debate , a great force , because that &apos;s what you say loud , and it &apos;s also manifested .
So what do we actually want to manifest , a disabled person or a powerful person ?
People alone , already a human being , mindless .
When you &apos;re a child , it could be enough to limit them and give them ideas .
Too imposing it would not be more beautiful to open doors to them .
A human being who , for me , opened doors was my pediatrician .
AM : A.I.I. DuPont Institute in the Wilmington Institute in Delaware .
He &apos;s called Dr. Pizzutillo , an Italo @-@ American whose name is , you can think , like you .
The majority of Americans are not saying correctly .
So , he &apos;s always been Dr. P.
And Dr. P. was always very , very colorful flies , and he was very busy working with kids .
Simply , how created ?
I found the time that I found in this hospital that I spent , just great .
Until the time I was physiotherapy .
I had to do some exercises , seemingly infinitely .
With these thick , elastic bands in different colors .
That &apos;s what you know about .
My leg muscles build up , and I have these bands hated more than anything else .
I have them hated .
I have them cursed .
I have them hated and I put them in perspective .
I have even already hated as a kid of five with Dr. P.
And so , this is how these exercises try to stop .
Natural , without success .
And one day , he has me at a one of my exercises .
These exercises were just tiring and tiring and merciless .
And he said to me , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young .
Girl : You &apos;re going to be one of those tapes one day .
And when you break it , give it to you a hundred dollars . &quot;
That was , of course , just a simple trick by Dr. P. to get the exercises done , which I don &apos;t want to do .
With the view that richest five @-@ year @-@ old girls in the hospital on the second floor will be .
But he has me actually to do that , actually , to bring my daily exercise horror to new eyes .
So this has turned into a new and promising experience .
And I ask myself today how I feel about his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl .
My self @-@ image has shaped , and I imagine it was , as a self @-@ image , naturally strong , powerful and atlethic person , to see myself .
That &apos;s just one example of what many people like adults in power positions are doing .
The imagination of a child can inspire .
But how the imagination of a child can inspire the imagination , as the examples from the synonymous dictionaries that have already been cited , shows us that our language doesn &apos;t allow us any space to imagine something .
What we &apos;re all hoping for would be for each and every one of us to be able to make ourselves a powerful human being .
Our language is lagging behind social change . It &apos;s lagging behind in many cases through technological change , which has been triggered by a change in our society .
From medical standpoint , from a medical standpoint , of course , you can say that my legs , laser surgery for visually impaired visually impaired , knee joints made of titanium and artificial hip joints for aging bodies , which allow people to really use all their possibilities and to cross the boundaries that their natural destiny has set them .
Even if it is not mentioned , social networking platforms .
People allow themselves to have their own identity , give themselves to their own way , define themselves and thereby become global in nature , oriented towards groups that they themselves , choose .
Perhaps this is the technological change that makes this clearer .
Because ever before , it &apos;s always been a different truth . That is , that every person in society has something very special and very powerful giving , and that every person in society has the human ability to adapt .
Our greatest plus is the human being &apos;s ability to adapt .
That &apos;s a really interesting story .
Because people tell me time and again about asking me to tell how I can deal with adversity .
And I &apos;m going to confess something to you : This sentence has .
It &apos;s never been fitting to me , and I &apos;ve always been very uncomfortable .
It &apos;s what I felt .
It &apos;s the questions people ask about answering .
And I think , gradually , I understand .
Why ?
This sentence from dealing with adversity is alive from the idea of the idea that success or happiness depends on it .
A challenge to master .
Without being challenged by the experience that it brings . As if it were my life that successful , I would have done it .
Because I was able to see the possible traps of a life with a prosthesis .
Or how , anyway , people , with my disability , perceive me .
But the truth is that we have to change .
Of course , we are facing the challenge .
No matter whether you &apos;re physical , emotional or even both .
And I &apos;m saying that &apos;s good , right ?
Distastements are not an obstacle that we curve .
Distastinguishers are just part of our lives .
And I tend to be adversity as my shadow .
Sometimes I realize that he &apos;s very present , very present .
Sometimes he &apos;s barely too visible .
But he &apos;s constantly at me .
And I want to make absolutely no sense of the impact or severity of the fight of a human being .
It &apos;s in life adversity and adversity and challenges , and they &apos;re all too real .
And every person goes with it differently .
So , to ask the question , isn &apos;t it whether we can get clear or not with adversity , but how we get clear with it ?
We &apos;re therefore not just for that to happen .
The people who we love before we hit fate are not just responsible for keeping them from getting ready .
All right .
So , to make it clear .
And we &apos;re doing our kids no favours .
If we give them the feeling that we &apos;re feeling they &apos;re not able to adapt .
You have to do two things : Clearly separate .
So one is medical fact amputees the medical fact and , one , amputee the other .
The social opinion about whether I &apos;m disabled is , or not .
And to be honest , the social opinion about whether I &apos;m disabled or not . The only real and lasting disability I had to deal with is that the world is constantly saying .
It can tell me with these definitions , and I can tell you .
In our desire to make people understand how to protect the people that care about us and to protect them from the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis , or even a prognosis about quality of life that they have to expect .
We must be careful not to lose the foundation for us not to actually obstruct someone from being disabled .
Perhaps it is the current concept that is only looking at it .
What is happening in a broken and how we do that repair for everyone , a single one , a greater disability than pathology itself .
If we do a human being not treat holistically and not all of his forces and possibilities and possibilities .
And acknowledge , we create , in addition to the natural struggle that you might need to fight .
A further disease .
We degrade a human being who is responsible for our society , a human being .
So we need to talk about patology beyond patology and look at the whole range of areas of human possibilities .
At the very most important point , though , is that there is a gap between perception of our inadequacies and our great inventive spirit .
We should connect these challenging times , not devalue or deny them .
We should not try to try to avoid them .
We should not try to avoid them , nor should we sweep them under the carpet , but it is .
That is what is at stake in the odds .
It is what I might rather be interested in making clear is that we do not necessarily overcome adversity , but that we need to be open to it , embrace it , embrace it , grab it in the head , and even use a campaign expression .
And maybe even with it dancing , too .
And maybe you can do it against adversity as something natural , coherent and useful to see and feel like this , through your presence , not anymore so burdened .
In this year , we celebrate the 200th anniversary of Charles &apos; Darwin .
And when he was 150 years ago about evolution , he wrote about evolution , Darwin , in my eyes , has something very true in human character .
I would like to rewrite it that way , not the strongest of its kind survives .
And also , not the smartest of its kind , but that of change in the best way to adapt .
From conflicts , creativity does not just emerge from Darwin &apos;s work .
Knowledge , we know that the ability of man to survive and flourish from struggle of struggle of the human mind .
Determined is the result of conflict , to change .
So again , change and adaptation are the greatest abilities of the human being .
And maybe you know , first of all , what wood ?
We carved are when we really are tested .
Maybe it &apos;s that that sense that we have adversity .
It &apos;s that perception of the ego .
It &apos;s that sense of our own power .
We can feel that way ourselves .
We can give ourselves something to adversity , a new meaning , that goes beyond difficult times .
Maybe we can give adversity as a change .
Adversity stands for a change in the way we feel like we don &apos;t yet adapted .
I think that the greatest damage that we do to ourselves is the greatest damage we believe we do normal , that we should be normal .
Let &apos;s face it .
Who is normal ?
It &apos;s not normal .
It &apos;s normal . The typical thing is , but not normal , and would you do those poor , gray person ?
Really , do you know ?
Learning to learn ?
If it does , if there were you , I don &apos;t think so .
It would be great if we could have this pattern of normality versus another of the possibilities or the strength around us , even the normal pattern of normality , to put it a little more dangerously .
So you can do that to exchanging the forces of very many children .
And they can invite them to refresh their very special and valuable abilities into society , to bring them into the society .
Anthropolgen has found out that we have human beings from members of our society , always one thing we have demanded : To be useful and to contribute to .
It &apos;s evidence of evidence that there &apos;s already Neanderthals 60 years ago , older people , 60,000 people , and people with severe physical injuries , who have worn with them .
And that &apos;s perhaps because the Neandertaler experience in survival struggle of these people for society is valuable to society .
It &apos;s because they don &apos;t have broken these people and they &apos;re useless .
They see them as something special .
And valuable things .
They were treated a few years ago . I went to a food market in the city where I grew up .
In that Red Zone , in the northeast of Pennsylvania , and I stood there in front of a cup of tomatoes .
It was summer .
And I had shorts on .
And I hear how a guy is behind me saying ,
&quot; Well , if that &apos;s not Aimee Mullins , and I turn around and I see this older man . &quot;
I had no idea who he was .
And I meant , &quot; Excuse me . &quot;
Sir , do we know ?
I can &apos;t get involved .
You remember .
And he said , &quot; Well , yeah . &quot;
You &apos;re probably unlikely to get involved .
I remember when I saw you as the first time I saw you , I took you out of your mother &apos;s belly .
&quot; Oh , so , he did . &quot; And of course , it did , but click .
That was Dr. Kean .
A man who I only made of narratives of my mother about this day ,
Because I was , of course , quite typical of my birthday , two weeks late .
The doctor for prenatal diagnostics of my mother was in vacation ,
And so I knew my parents knew the man who made me born , the man who gave me no idea at all .
And because I was without a calf &apos;s legs .
And my feet , after them , were facing .
And I just had a few toes .
At this one and a few toes at the other foot , was he the handler , the stranger had to .
The bad news had to pass .
He said to me , &quot; I had to tell your parents that you never would walk and never walk like that and never be so mobile .
Would you be like other kids , or you would never be an independent life ? &quot;
And since then , they &apos;ve just lied to me .
They &apos;ve punished me .
Really ?
Exceptional . I found that he &apos;s been cutting newspaper clips of my entire childhood .
No matter whether I was competing for a letter in second grade , whether I was winning .
Whether I was competing with the scouts at the parade at Halloween , whether I was traveling with my scholarship or my scholarship or one of my sporting victories .
And he used these clips to make his students see how to teach .
Medical students from the Hahnemann Medical School and the Hershey Medical School ,
And he called this part of his course the X factor factor , the potential of human will .
You can just not do enough to emphasize how crucial this factor is to the quality of life of a human being .
And Dr. Kean told us .
He said , &quot; I learned that children , if they don &apos;t do something else all the time , and even if they just do a little bit of support .
If you have kids , you leave them to themselves , then kids can do a lot .
Look at it .
DR : Kean has his thinking changed .
He had understood that the medical care diagnosis and how someone else can deal with it .
Two different things are , and they are .
I have my thinking in the course of time changed .
If you want to change me at the age of 15 , would you have asked me if I could have my prostheses against legs of meat and bone ?
Then I would not have hesitated for a second .
I wanted to do it absolutely normal .
If you would have me ask that today , I &apos;m not so sure .
And that &apos;s what happened because I have something to do with my legs and not with my legs , despite these experiences .
And maybe I could have done that change because I was so many people I met , who were doors open to me .
Instead of people meeting people who were restricting me or giving me an idea , they were trying to get a picture .
See , you .
It takes really just one person . It takes you to demonstrate .
How you want to manifest your forces and you &apos;re through them .
If you want to allow someone to do their own inner forces , you know .
You want the human mind to be ready to receive it .
If you want to do that and for someone in a critical moment , you open a door .
Then you &apos;re ready for these people . You &apos;re a very good teacher .
You bring them to their own devices , doors to open .
The real meaning of the word .
Educate is rooted in the word educe .
It means something to produce that in a word that is potential to tickle out .
Again , what potential do we want ?
Well , call in the &apos; 60s , in Britain , a case study was done .
Back then , high schools were transformed into total schools .
They call this there streaming trials .
In the United States , we call this tracking , which students are going to be divided into grades .
And the A students are going to get more orally tested .
The better teachers , etc . They have then a three @-@ month period of time , students with a sufficient one .
The grade very good given .
It was given to them .
They were told that they were aces , they were very smart .
And after these three months , they had really a single letter .
And of course , it breaks you apart .
That heart to hear that the other way around , the one @-@ serer students were told .
They were just enough .
And the same was the case after the three months , after the three months .
But only those who always have to go to school still were , apart from the students who were at school , the ones who had to miss the school .
All the more important in this study was that the teachers were not inaugurated .
The teachers knew not that something was changed .
They were just told that they were the Einser students and that they were the students with the grade enough .
And just as they gave them something , they taught them .
And they treated the only real thing that &apos;s disabled is a broken mind .
A spirit that &apos;s broken has broken has no hope anymore .
It finds nothing more beautiful .
It lacks our natural , childish curiosity and our innate ability to understand imagination .
If we do , though , we can create the human mind to help keep hoping for ourselves , self and others , to keep hoping around .
Beautiful to find , curious and imaginative , to be .
Then put us on our forces really positively , really .
If a mind is above these qualities , then we can have a new reality and new forms of existence .
I want to talk to you about a poem that &apos;s written by a Persian poet named Hafiz in the 14th century .
And by the one that my friend Jacques Dembois tells me about , and the poem is called &quot; The God Who Only Words Four . &quot;
Every child knows God , not the God .
The name , not the God .
The prohibition , but the God of God , who knows only four words .
And these all the time .
He says , &quot; Just come dance with me . &quot;
&quot; Come dance with me . &quot;
Thank you very much .
