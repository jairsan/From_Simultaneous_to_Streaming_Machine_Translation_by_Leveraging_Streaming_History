Before a few years ago here at TED , Peter Skillman presented a design competition called &quot; The Marshmallow Challenge . 
&quot; The idea is pretty simple . Four teams have to get the widest possible freestanding structure with 20 spaghetti , about 1m tape , about 1m thread . And one marshmallow is built , 
the marshmallow has to get up on top . His 
and though it &apos;s really easy , it &apos;s actually , really true . Hard because it &apos;s pushing people , very quickly , to work together . 
And so , I thought this was a really interesting idea . And I have it in a way that I turned into a design workshop . 
It was a huge success . 
It &apos;s been a success since then , I &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world . It &apos;s been with students , developers and architects , even CTOs , the Fortune 50 companies , and there &apos;s something about this task . What depth of impressions into nature is . The collaboration allows and I want to share some of these with you . 
Normally , the majority of people start themselves . Regarding the task of orienting them , 
they talk about it , they think about what it looks like . Will it hang around to power , 
then they invest in it ? A little time . In planning and organization , they sketch and lay spaghetti out of it , 
they invest a lot of their time . In the assembly , of constantly growing structures , 
and finally , just before they don &apos;t have time anymore . Take someone who takes the Marshmallow . And they put him gently . On the top , they take a step . Back and TA @-@ da admire . They admire their work . 
What , then , almost always happens is that this TA @-@ da becomes an UH @-@ Oh . Because that weight of the marshmallow causes the marshmallow to do the whole thing to bend and collapse , 
there &apos;s a series of people who have a lot more UH @-@ Oh moments . When others and under the worst and worst are freshest BWL graduates , 
they lie , they cheat . They &apos;re confused . And they really produce . Droughty entities . 
And of course , there are teams . The lots more TA @-@ DA entities , and among the best are . Fresh graduates of the kindergarten , 
and that &apos;s quite amazing . 
How we have Peter told us , they not only produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting ones . Structures of all , 
what you might ask , are they going to ? Is like , &quot; Is that coming ? &quot; Why ? What is the point of those , 
and Peter ? Is not one of the kids telling us , &quot; Is there time investing in it ? &quot; Chef of Spaghetti GmbH . About being you invest ? 
You don &apos;t invest time . In power struggles . 
There are still one more reason , 
and that is that BWL students were trained . The one real plan to find the one . OK . And he 
then went to realize what 
then happens . If you want to get the Marshmallow to the top , you don &apos;t have time anymore , and what happens ? 
It &apos;s a crisis . 
Sounds familiar . What ? What else 
do kindergarten kids do ? Make it is they &apos;re connected to the Marshmallow . And prototypes build successful prototypes . Always with the Marshmallow at the Marshmallow top . So that they multiple times have the opportunity to build dilapidated prototypes to repair . 
Constructors recognize these kinds of collaboration . And with each attempt , the core of an iterative process is 
the kids get immediately . Feedback : What works ? And what doesn &apos;t work ? 
So this is the performance with prototypes . Towards working , essential , but let &apos;s see how different . Teams act . 
The average for the majority is , at about 50 centimeters , BWL students . Create the half . Of these lawyers , something . More , but not . A lot of kindergarten kids . Are better . Than the adults , 
who is at the most successful ? 
Architects and engineers . 
Zum Happittlich 1M ist das tallest ist das ich seen . 
And why ? Because they have three @-@ corner understanding . And self @-@ reinforcing geometric patterns . Are the keys ? To provide stable structures , 
CEOs , there &apos;s something above average . But here &apos;s where it gets interesting . 
Setting you in an executive administrator on the team , you &apos;ll become significantly better . 
It &apos;s incredible . You can see around and you can see this team . Will win ? You 
can predict . Why ? Will this happen ? 
Because you have special skills in process monitoring . 
You run the process . You understand it , 
and that team that governs and governs it , and pays attention to the work , the team &apos;s performance will significantly improve . 
Specialized skills and process skills and their combination will lead to success . 
If you have 10 teams that have typical procedures , you get about six , the stable structures have . 
I tried now something exciting : 
I thought , let &apos;s bring the poker bet in the same way . 
So , I offered a $ 10,000 prize . I offered software for the winners , 
what do you think happened ? I mean , with these design students , 
what was that ? 
Result : This was not what happened . A team had a stable structure , 
right ? If anyone had a two @-@ inch @-@ tall construction , they would have built the prize home 
, right ? Is it , then , not interesting ? That high betting bets have a strong effect , 
we repeated these exercises with the same students . 
What do you think happened ? 
Well , now you understood the advantage . Of prototyping , 
this is how the same bad team became . One of the best ones 
they made was the highest construction in the slightest time . 
It &apos;s like there are profound lessons for us . About the nature of propulsion and propulsion and 
success , you may ask . Why ? Would anyone actually spend time ? A Marshmallow Challenge to 
create . The reason is , I help digital tools . And processes create to teams to create to help . Cars , video games and visual . Effects to create . 
And what the Marshmallow Challenge does is it helps them create hidden assumptions . 
Because , frankly , every project has its own Marshmallow , the challenge that it offers 
. It &apos;s a shared experience , a shared language or attitude , the right prototype to 
build . And this is the value of this experience . This one , this simple exercise , 
and those of you who are interested in it , can be MarshmallowChallenge @ com. Visit 
it . It &apos;s a blog where you can see . How to get the Marshmallows built . 
It &apos;s a step @-@ by @-@ step guide there . 
You can find crazy examples . Everybody around the world , like people optimize the system and 
refine it . There are also world records , 
and the basal lesson , I think . Is that construction ? In fact , a connecting sport . Is 
it required ? Is it that we all put our senses on the task and that we should think our thinking optimally ? How do we use our emotions and our actions in the challenge that we face ? And sometimes 
it &apos;s a small prototype . This experience , everything it takes , What it takes us from an UH @-@ Oh to a TA @-@ DA moment . To bring 
and bring that can make you a big difference . 
Thank you very much . 
Do we do it as if we have a machine here 
? A big machine . A cool TED @-@ like one . Machine and that &apos;s a time machine . 
And everybody in this room has to enter and they can 
, in fact , go back to the past , they can go into the future . They can &apos;t go into the here 
and now . And I ask myself , what do you choose ? Would you choose ? Because I would have been a frequent user of this question to my friends recently , and they all wanted to go back to the past . 
I know not . They wanted to go back to time before it had cars . Or Twitter or America . They wanted to 
look for the superstar . I know not . 
I &apos;m convinced that you somehow want to nostalgia for wishful thinking , to nostalgia . 
And that &apos;s what I understand . 
I &apos;m not part of this group . Must I say , &quot; 
I don &apos;t want to go back to the past , &quot; and that &apos;s not because I &apos;m an adventurer . It &apos;s because 
it &apos;s because opportunities on this planet are not going back . They &apos;re going forward . 
So I want to go into this machine , and I want to go into the future . 
This is the greatest time . The time it ever has on this planet , no matter what scale you &apos;re going to take . Health , wealth . Mobility , opportunities , declining . Disease rates . 
There has never been a time like this before , when 
my great grandparents died . Everybody when they were 60 , 
my grandparents urged these numbers to push 70 , 
my parents . Are the 80 ? On the heels . 
There should be better a nine @-@ on @-@ the @-@ beginning of my death . 
But it &apos;s not even a question of people . How we get this ? Because this is a bigger thing . Than that one 
child who &apos;s today in New Delhi is born , can do . Expect this long to live . How the richest man on the planet can live 100 years ago think . You 
think about this . This is an incredible fact . 
And why is this so ? The 
smallpox , smallpox , has billions of people on this planet killed . 
They &apos;ve got demographics of the Earth . On a way , they &apos;ve redesigned it in a way that no war has ever managed . 
They &apos;re gone . They &apos;re gone . 
We &apos;ve got them defeated . Puff 
in the rich world . Do diseases exist ? The millions of us before just a few generations ago still threatened by disease ? Hardly any 
diphtheria is rubbing polio . 
White at all . Still , someone ? What that is ? 
Vaccines . Modern medicine . Our ability to treat billions of people , these are successes . The scientific method and the scientific method , 
in my view , is the stuff . Try it out , see if it works . It changes when it changes when it doesn &apos;t . It &apos;s one of the greatest achievements of humanity , 
so that &apos;s the good news . 
Unfortunately , that &apos;s already the whole good news . Because it &apos;s a couple of other problems . And they &apos;ve been mentioned many times . 
And one of them is that despite all of our achievements , one billion people on this planet , every day . Hungry to bed . Go to 
that number , rise , and it rises very quickly . And that &apos;s embarrassing . 
And not only that . We have our imagination to use to do that . 
These are the world that is being thoroughly devastated : Drinking water , primal land , rainforests . Oil , gas , they disappear . And that is about to disappear . And if we look at it , not from this chaos , we disappear , too , 
the question . Is it possible , can we do that ? I think , well , 
I think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food . Can the billions of people feed ? Will it be without the land on which they live ? Will it be rape ? 
I think we can rape this world with energy . The world that they don &apos;t destroy at the same time . 
I really think so . And no . That &apos;s not wishful thinking . 
But that &apos;s what keeps me at night awake . One of the things that keeps me awake at night is we have scientific progress never before , so much needed . How now ? Still , never before . 
And we &apos;ve also been unprecedented . We &apos;ve been able to make it reasonable . We used to use it as we can today . 
We &apos;re at the threshold of the amazing , amazing events on many fronts and yet , I think , really , we &apos;re hundreds of 300 years before the Enlightenment , going back . Would we have to go back to find a time ? In the time we &apos;re fighting progress , in which we &apos;re talking about these things more vigorously . In more fronts than we have now , 
people are wrapping themselves in their faith , and that &apos;s so narrow . That you can &apos;t liberate them . 
Can &apos;t even liberate the truth . They liberate and hear 
them . Everybody has a right . On their mind , even a right . On their opinion about progress , 
but they know what they &apos;re not entitled to . 
They have no right to their right to their own facts . Testimonization has you not , 
and I have a while taken , To do that , 
about a little decade ago , I got an article about immunization for The New Yorker , written . A little article 
and I was a little surprised at resistance . To come across resistance to resistance to what was ultimately what the most effective measure in healthcare in the history of healthcare in humanity . Is 
I ? I didn &apos;t know what I was doing . Should I do , I was just doing what I was doing all the time . I wrote a paper and I drove on . 
And soon thereafter , I wrote an article about genetically modified organisms . Food that was the 
same thing . Only bigger , 
people played crazy . 
So I got mad about it as well . I wrote an article about it , and I couldn &apos;t understand . Why ? Why ? People thought that was frankenfood . Why ? They believed that molecules were going to be a particular molecule , rather than a random way of moving around , an attack on the territory of nature . 
Was it , you know , I &apos;m doing what I &apos;m doing ? I wrote the article . I did it . 
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist . We type , 
we type , we enter , we go food . That &apos;s okay . 
But these articles did make me worry . And I could not figure out why and eventually , I found . 
I found out . And that &apos;s because it &apos;s because these fanatics who mad me , they made me crazy . Anyway , no fanatics . Were 
they ? Cautious people . Educated people , decent people , 
they were just like people , like the people in this room . 
And that brought me that mess up . 
But then I thought , &quot; You know what ? Be let &apos;s be honest . 
We &apos;re at a point . We &apos;ve arrived at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress . How we used to talk . 
Intermediate about that . 
We talk ironically about it . &quot; With little quotes , about progress , 
okay , there are reasons for that . And I think we know which ones we know are . 
We have that trust in institutions , in authority and sometimes sometimes in the science . We have lost in itself , and there is no reason why that &apos;s not supposed to be like that . 
You can just have a few names . And the people are going to understand 
Chernobyl . Bhopal , the Challenger , Vioxx weapons of mass destruction , the 2000 US presidential election , I mean , 
you know , you can choose your own list . 
It &apos;s questions and problems . It &apos;s with the people we have believed we were always going to be right . Be right , so be skeptical . 
Ask them questions , demand . You need evidence . You need evidence . You 
don &apos;t take evidence for granted . 
Go , but now it &apos;s when you get evidence , you have to accept that evidence . And in that , we &apos;re not good at . And I can do that from 
the reason that I do . That we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear . How do I live in an epidemic of fear that I &apos;ve never seen before ? And hopefully never again see . About 
about about 12 years ago , it became . A story was published . A terrible story . The story of the Autism epidemic with the measles , mumps and rubells , associated vaccine . 
Very scary . 
Haufenwise , studies were done . To help you see if that was true , 
Haufenwise studies were to be done . That &apos;s a serious issue . 
The data came in . 
The data came in . The data came in from the United States , from England , from Sweden , from Canada , and they were all the same . No correlation , no connection . No connection at all , no . 
It doesn &apos;t matter . It makes no difference . Because we &apos;re looking at anecdotes , we believe what we see . What we see to believe , what causes us to feel like we &apos;re real . 
We believe not in a bundle of documents . From a government clerk who gives us data and I understand why , I think that &apos;s what we all do . 
But you know what ? That &apos;s 
the result of this was catastrophic . 
Catastrophic because of this fact , the United States is one of the only countries in the world . In that case , the vaccine rate for measles is falling , 
that &apos;s scandalous , and we should be ashamed . 
It &apos;s terrible . 
What is happening ? That we &apos;re doing that ? 
Well , I understand that . That &apos;s what I do . Because has 
this somebody here got measles ? 
Has a single one in the audience ? The somebody there has died of measles is 
not very often happening . 
Does it happen in this country ? Does it not happen at all ? But 160 000 times on the country &apos;s planet . 
In the last year , these are many deaths from measles . 20 per hour , 
but because that &apos;s not happening here . Is it possible , we can displace it ? And people like Jenny McCarthy can , Walk around . And messages from fear . And illiteracy of platforms like Oprah , and Larry King live live preach 
and preach , and you can do that . Because they cause and correlation , not connect . 
They understand not that these things are the same as things seem to be . But almost never , the same are , 
and that &apos;s something that we learn . Do we need to learn very quickly , and 
this guy was a hero of Jonas Salk , and 
he liberated us from one of the worst scourges of humanity . 
No fear . No agony . Chestness . Puff . Gone . 
The guy in the middle , not so much . 
He &apos;s called Paul Offit . 
He has just been with a couple of other people a 
rotavirus vaccine . He can use life to 400 lives , 500,000 children per person a year in developing countries . Save 
pretty well . Not . 
Well , that &apos;s good . Apart from the fact that Paul is walking around talking about vaccines and saying , &quot; How valuable they are . &quot; And that the people are just going to stop . 
Should they complain ? And that says , 
in fact , he says , &quot; So Paul is a terrorist , 
if Paul is speaking at a public hearing , he cannot speak without armed guards . &quot; Speeches 
he gets calls . Zu &quot; home . &quot; Because the people tell him like to . That they know where his children are going to school and where they are , 
and why ? Because Paul made a vaccine . 
I need that not . Tell me , but vaccines are essential . 
Take it . Take it away . Turn back the diseases . Back . Terrible diseases . And that &apos;s what happens . Right now , 
we have in this country measles 
and this is going to get worse . And pretty soon , children will be back to die . Because that &apos;s just one question , right ? The numbers 
and they will not be just about measles dying . What is 
the polio ? Take the polio . Why ? Not . A fellow militant . Of me , 
I was in front of me a few weeks ago and I said , &quot; She thinks I &apos;m a little too shrill . 
No one has ever done that before . 
&quot; She would tell her child not to go vaccinated against polio . She would never . 
Fine , 
why ? Because we don &apos;t have polio . And you know what ? 
We had in this country yesterday , no polio . 
Today , I don &apos;t know . Maybe this morning somebody went up in Lagos . In a plane and flies straight into the air . Go ahead . Angeles . IM IMPORTANT 
IS IT OVER OHIO , And in a few hours , it lands and rents . A car and he comes to the Long . Beach and he gets one of those fantastic TED dinner . TODAY evening , 
and he knows he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s going to have a crippling disease . And we know that as well . Not because that &apos;s how the world works . Now , let &apos;s say 
that &apos;s the planet . It &apos;s where we live . Do not . That &apos;s as if it doesn &apos;t . 
We love it . We love it in lying . We love it . 
Do you have it all this morning ? Take 
Echinacea . A little antioxidant that ? You on the jumps . Helps me . 
I know . That you do that . Because the half of Americans , half of them do that every day . 
They take that stuff . And they take alternative remedies . And it does not make any difference . How often do we find out that they &apos;re useless ? 
The data shows that all the time . 
They evaporate their urine . More do they do . Almost never . 
That &apos;s okay . You want to like 28 billion dollars . For dark urine , 
I pay . I agree with you completely . 
Dark urine , dark . 
Why ? Make us do that ? Why ? Make us do that . 
Well , I think I understand , we do . Hate the pharmaceutical industry . 
We hate a drug industry that &apos;s too strong . We have no confidence . We have no trust in the system , 
and we should not . Our healthcare system is . Mies , 
it &apos;s cruel . Too many millions of people , 
it &apos;s absolutely amazing . Cold and soulful , even . Too many of us who afford to be able to afford it , 
so we &apos;re walking away from it and where are we going . We , 
we &apos;re walking into the arms of the placebo industry . 
That &apos;s great . I love the placebo industry . 
But you know , that &apos;s what it &apos;s like . Is it really a serious business ? Because that stuff is crap . And we &apos;re giving billions of dollars for it . Out 
and I have all sorts of little props here , no . 
Of them , Gingko was cheating . Echinacea was cheating . Acai da knows I don &apos;t . Let &apos;s see what that is . But we give billions of dollars for that . Out of it is fraud , 
and you know what ? If I do that , I scream at people shouting at me . And they say , &quot; What cares ? &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s let people do it . &quot; What they want , feel like 
that . They feel good . And 
you know what ? They have a wrong point . 
Because it &apos;s not my concern . Whether it &apos;s the Health Minister , who says , &quot; Hmm , I &apos;m going to get the evidence from my experts on mammography . &quot; Or any cancer quack limb that can treat his patients with coffee intakes if 
they &apos;re looking at this path . Where do I think and magic , evidence and science replace , they get to a place where they don &apos;t get to be . 
They get to Thabo . Mbeki : In South Africa , 
he brought 400,000 of his people around because he insisted on insisting that red beds , garlic and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs . From those of whom we know they &apos;re going to be the ones that can slow down the course of AIDS . 
Hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country that is worse than any other country from this disease . Will you say to me , 
please , don &apos;t you tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences ? The people you 
have , they have , they always 
have , the most brain @-@ free epidemic . In the one we &apos;re in right now , this absurd fight between the proponents of genetically modified organisms is . Changed food and the bio @-@ elite . 
That &apos;s an idiotic one . Debate : It has to stop . 
It &apos;s a debate about words about words about metaphors . 
That &apos;s ideology . Not science . 
Everything that we eat , every grain of rice , every branch of parsley , every sprouts . Was made by people change 
? You know , there was no mandarin . IM PARADISE : There was 
no cantaloupe melons . ES : There were no Christmas trees . We have that all done . 
We have it in the last few 11 000 years . 
And some of it worked . And some of it didn &apos;t work . 
We &apos;re got rid of it . What didn &apos;t work 
? Does it work ? Now we can do it more precisely . And of course , there are risks . But we can do something like vitamin A in rice . And that stuff can do to millions of people . Millions of people , their lives . 
Towards prolong that . That &apos;s what they want . Not do . 
I have to say , I understand that . Not us , 
we reject genetically . Modified food . 
AB : Why ? Do we do that ? 
Well , what I hear all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides . Hormones . Mono @-@ culture . We don &apos;t want huge fields . With a thing that &apos;s wrong , that &apos;s wrong . 
We want not to have companies live patenting , 
we don &apos;t want companies to own seeds . 
And you know what ? My answer to all of this is , 
yes , you &apos;re right . Fix this . 
It &apos;s true . We have a huge food problem . But that &apos;s not science . 
That &apos;s what science has nothing to do with . 
It &apos;s right . Morality , patent crab . 
You know that science is not a company . 
It &apos;s not a country . 
It &apos;s not even a idea . It &apos;s a process . 
It &apos;s a process . And sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t . But the idea that we &apos;re going to be allowing science not to do its work is to do it . Because we &apos;re afraid . Is it a real impasse ? And it keeps millions of people in the flourishing world . 
You know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to get 70 percent more food . Do we have to grow 70 percent more food than we currently have 70 percent of 
this investment in Africa over the last 30 years ? 
Shameful , shameful . 
You need that , and we &apos;ll give it to you . Not , 
and why ? Genetically . Modified food . 
We want people not to encourage this rotten stuff . To eat like for example Maniok 
, Maniok is something that is a half a billion people eat . 
It &apos;s about like a potato . 
It &apos;s just a bundle of calories . It &apos;s bad . 
It has no nutrients . It has no protein . And scientists are building all this right now . It &apos;s inside of it , 
and then people could eat it . And would not be blind . Will they be blind ? Would 
they not starve ? And you know what ? 
That would be nice . It would not be Chez . Panisse , but it would be beautiful , 
and everything I would say about it is why fight against this . 
I mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves why . Fight against this . 
Because we don &apos;t push genes around . 
It &apos;s not about genes being pushed around . It &apos;s not about chemicals . 
It &apos;s not about our ridiculous , ridiculous ones . Passion for hormones . Our insistence on greater food . Better food . A unique food . 
It &apos;s here not about rice . Krispies : It &apos;s about people at life . It &apos;s about keeping people alive . And it &apos;s going to be high time to understand . What that means , 
because you know what if we do that , 
if we don &apos;t . If we do that , we go on as we do before , we do it . Something guilty of it . Something we believe we don &apos;t . Something guilty of it , high @-@ tech colonialism . 
There &apos;s no other description . For that , what &apos;s happening here , 
it &apos;s selfish . It &apos;s ugly . It &apos;s our not worthy . And we have to really stop that . 
After that incredibly funny conversation , we want you , maybe , to say , &quot; Do you still want to be in this ridiculous ? &quot; Time machine and time machine and go into the future 
, definitely . That wants me to do anyway . In the moment , 
it &apos;s in the present . But we have a tremendous opportunity , 
we can do this time machine on everything . What we want , we can do it . Where 
we can move it . Do we want it , and we will . Do we move it where we want ? We need 
to do these conversations . And we need to think . But if we &apos;re going to go into the time machine and into the future . We &apos;re going to be happy . That &apos;s what we did . We &apos;re happy to have . 
I know we can . And that &apos;s what I think is , as far as I &apos;m concerned , something the world needs now . 
Thank you . 
Thank you . As Steve Lopez , columnist , who &apos;s Los Angeles Times , one day , through the streets in the center of Los Angeles . Listened to a wonderful music . 
You came from a man , a African @-@ American , sympathetic . Rau , homeless , who &apos;s on a violin . The only ones who still had two strings , 
many of them will be familiar with the story . Because from Steves &apos; articles about this later on , a book became a film . With Robert Downey , Junior , when Steve Lopez and Jamie Foxx were Nathaniel Anthony . Ayers @ the contrabass player at the Juilliard Conservatory , and his promising career tragically early on through his paranoid career . Schizophrenia ends up being eliminated . 
Nathaniel left Juilliard , suffered a nervous breakdown , and 30 years later he lived as homeless on the streets of Skid Row . In the center of Los Angeles , 
I recommend to all of you Steves &apos; book . To read or read the movie or to watch it . To make you not only look at the wonderful connection . The interconnection between these two men that arose , but also , like music , this connection is made . Helped and how it eventually helped , and how it was the instrument , when this play of words is allowed , that helped . Nathaniel , away from the street , to get away . 
I met Mr. Ayers in 2008 . Before two years ago , in the Walt Disney Concert Hall , 
he had just a demonstration . From Beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , heard and came behind the stage to get himself behind to imagine me . 
He spoke in a very cheerful , and convivial tone . About yo @-@ yo , ma and Hillary Clinton and about how the Dodgers never heard it in baseball world . Series : Series would do it all because of the insidious passage . The first violin in the last sentence of Beethoven &apos;s Fourth Symphony : 
&quot; We came up with the theme . ( Music ) Speaking and a few days later , I got a mail in which I was saying , &quot; That Nathaniel was in favour of violin lessons with me . 
I still have to mention that Nathaniel is a person who refused medical treatment , because he was already in the process of electroshocks and thorazine . &quot; And handcuffs are being treated . A trauma that has been trauma to him all his life , 
as a result of which he is now particularly vulnerable . For these schizophrenic phases , which are sometimes so bad that they &apos;re treating him to tear him apart . And he &apos;s disappearing for days . In the streets of Skid Row , wandering around , always this horror . And the torturing torment of his own mind , and in exactly 
the same stage of irritation , Nathaniel was when we were with our first lesson in class in the Walt Disney Concert Hall . And he started having this crazy flickering in his eyes . And he was totally lost . 
He spoke about invisible . Demons and smoke and about how things like someone in sleep would poison him . 
Want I ? I was afraid . Not for me , but I was afraid . That I would lose him . Could that he could be put into one of his states ? And that I would give him his relationship with the violin . Could if I started talking about clay ladders and arpeggios and others , exciting forms of didactic ? Violin pedagogy to talk . 
So I just started . 
To play , I played the first sentence of Beethoven . Violin Concerto 
and while I was playing , I noticed that in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes , a complete change was taking place . It was when 
it was as if under the influence of an invisible doctor . It was a chemical reaction , the catalyst of which was my game , 
turning Nathaniel &apos;s maniac anger . Turning into understanding , into a calm curiosity and grace and grace , 
and like a miracle , he took his violin . And he started hearing . Some excerpts of violin concerts to play . And he asked me to then play them to the end . To play Mendelssohn Chaikovsky , Sibelius : We started playing over , 
and then we started playing over music . To talk about , starting with Bach . To talk about Beethoven , Brahms , Bruckner and all the other BS of Bartók . To go as far as ESA @-@ Pekka Salonen 
and I realized that he not only was an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but also he had an encyclopedic knowledge of music . But he also had it with her , a close personal relationship . And 
he talked about her . He talked about her with passion and understanding that I otherwise only talk about with my colleagues in the Philharmonic of Los Angeles . 
I know by knowing music . And about music , it was from this paranoid , confused man . The guy who was just walking through the streets of Los Angeles , he was still walking . He was a kind , educated man . Excellent in Juilliard . Educated musician Became 
Music Is medicine ? Music changes We are 
changed for Nathaniel . Music means music . Eligible health , 
because music allows you to give him his thoughts and delusions with the help of his imagination and creativity . In something real 
, to transform and escape , he escapes his tormenting . 
Status : I understood that this is exactly the nature of art , right ? It &apos;s 
this that &apos;s why it &apos;s why we make music . So that we can do something that &apos;s deep inside of us all . Our feelings through our artistic lens , through our creativity , through our reality . Forms can form , 
and the reality of that expression . Achieved to us all . And moves , inspires . And unites us what 
Nathaniel was about . So , he was brought by music . Back to a community . From friends who were 
the redeeming power of music , he brought him back . In a family of musicians who were bringing him to understand the talent that he knew . And he was paying attention , 
and I &apos;m going to talk to Nathaniel again and again . No matter whether in the Walt Disney Concert Hall or in the Skid Row , because he reminds me of why he reminds me why I became a musician . 
Thank you very much . 
Bruno Giussani : Thank you very much . Thank you . 
Robert Gupta , 
Robert Gupta : I want to play something . That I shamefully like the cellist stolen . 
Have I hope you forgive me , 
I am Jane McGonigal . I design computer games . 
I develop . Now , for 10 years . Online games and my goal for the next decade . Is it the same easy thing to do ? The world in which reality is happening to save . How you save in online games to 
save is , I have a plan for that . I want more people to convince . Including you all , more time with the game of bigger and more amazing . 
Games to spend now spend , we spend 3 billion hours per week . With online games , 
some of you may think , &quot; This is a lot . Time for games , 
maybe something to too much . &quot; Time , if you think about how many problems we &apos;re facing urgently in the real world to solve . Do 
you actually have my research on the Institute for the Future , however , that &apos;s exactly the opposite ? Right ? 
Three billion hours a week . Are not nearly enough ? To get the most pressing problems 
in the world to solve ? Actually , I am convinced that if we do the next century on this planet , we want to survive this time dramatically . Increase that time . 
I calculated . That the time needed to do that at 21 billion hours of play time per week is 
first , maybe a little bit absurd . So I repeat , so that it works , if we can have problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity solved . Do you want to do that , I think we have to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours per week by the end of the next decade . 
No . I mean , it &apos;s really . 
Ernst . Why ? 
This picture describes quite exactly why . I think that games are so vital to the survival of the human species in the human species in the future . 
Are they serious ? This is a portrait of the photographer . Phil Toledano : 
He wanted to express the feelings of playing . So he has in front of the players a camera . 
This is one of the classic expressions of playing . 
If you don &apos;t play a player , you may miss some of the nuances in this picture . 
You can probably see this sense of urgency . Something of fear . But also extreme concentration , deeply deepened . In the solving of a really difficult problem , 
if you &apos;re playing . See , some nuances . Here &apos;s the upward . Drawn eyes . And the mouth is a sign of a optimism . The eyebrows show surprise . 
This is a player who is on the edge of what &apos;s called an epic victory . 
Oh , you know that ? OK . 
Great . So , we have some players here , 
an epic victory is . A result that &apos;s so very positive is that they were previously even not aware that they knew it was possible at all . 
It was almost beyond the imagination . And if you did it , you &apos;re shocked that you &apos;re actually going to be doing something like 
that . That &apos;s a epical victory . 
This player is standing on the verge of an epic . Victory 
and this is it , which is what we have on millions of faces of problem solvers around the world . Do you have to , if we &apos;re going to tackle the hurdles of the next century , face of those who face the edge of an epic , contrary to all odds ? Victory is 
tja , unfortunately , to see . We &apos;re more likely to see this face . In real life , if we &apos;re going to face difficult problems , 
I call it that in life , I &apos;m . I &apos;m bad face . 
And it &apos;s actually my face , actually . See , yeah . OK . 
That &apos;s me . How I do that in life ? I &apos;m bad face . Do 
this . This is a graffiti . In my former home country in Berkeley , California , where I live in my Ph.D. study of why we do better in games . As in real life , 
this is a problem . This is a problem that many players have . 
We think that in reality , we &apos;re not so good . How in games ? And 
I mean , not only less successful . Although that &apos;s part of it , 
we &apos;re getting more in games . 
I mean , good in context . With the motivation to do something meaningful , inspired by collaboration , with each other 
, when we &apos;re in a game world . Believe me that many of us , many of us , are in our best version . Anytime , immediately , we &apos;re ready to help , persistently . That problem with solving , trying to solve as long as necessary , after failure , again try it out 
and in reality , when we fail , when we &apos;re on obstacles , when we feel . We feel often differently . 
We feel like we &apos;re overwhelmed . We feel like we &apos;re defeated . We feel like we &apos;re threatened . Maybe depressed . Frustrated or Cynical . 
These feelings have . We never have when we play games in games , there are games , they just exist . 
Not , and that &apos;s it . What I think as a PhD student wanted to study is , why is it in games 
? Impossible . Too hard to think you couldn &apos;t just achieve everything . 
How can we do those feelings out of the games into the reality ? So , 
I looked at games like World of Warcraft . That &apos;s the ideal environment for community problem solving , 
and I have some things to say that epic victories . In online worlds as 
possible , so first of all , if you &apos;re in one of these online games , especially in World of Warcraft . Is there a lot of different characters ? The ones ready to give you a world saving ? Mission to entrust you immediately , 
but not immediately . Only some mission , but a mission . The mission perfect for your current level at the game . Does it fit 
right ? So , you can do it . 
You get never a task . The mission you don &apos;t solve . 
But always at the edge of your skills , so you have to make an effort , 
but there &apos;s no unemployment . In World of Warcraft , you &apos;re not sitting around . And you turn around , dams . Are there always targeted ? Something important . Too important to do , and 
there are in a way . 
Employees , where they go . Hundreds of thousands of people who have collaborated with them to get their epic mission done 
, we have in real life . Not so easy . This feeling that , in a fingertip , some employees are willing to do it , 
and there are also ... There are these epic stories . These inspiring stories , why we &apos;re there . And what we &apos;re doing is what we get to do this whole positive thing . 
Feedback : You &apos;ve certainly got level feedback . High and 1 . Strength . Hear . Or 1 . Intelligence . 
This constant feedback . Gives us no . IM : In real life , 
when I leave this stage , I don &apos;t have . 1 . Speak and 1 . Crazy idea . 20 . Crazy . 
Idea . I get in the real life . 
This feedback , not so the problem with online collaboration worlds like World of Warcraft . Is that it &apos;s so satisfying that it &apos;s . Anytime , on the edge of an epic victory . Too close to being that we prefer to be in these all our time in these game worlds , 
they &apos;re just better . Than the 
reality , until now , all the World of Warcraft players have in common . Five : 93 million years spent it on virtual problems of virtual problems 
from Azerbaijan . That &apos;s not necessarily something bad . 
It sounds like bad . But it sounds bad , for 
a moment , in context five : 93 million years ago . Did our first primate ancestors start erecting ? 
The first upright primacy , 
so OK ? So if we talk about how we &apos;re going to spend so much time playing games at the moment . Do that just make sense ? When do you start to spend time looking at the scale of the human development ? Before you look at what &apos;s extraordinary , but also appropriate . 
Because it &apos;s coming out that it turns out that by doing all this time at play , we &apos;re going to play . In fact , change what we &apos;re doing as humans , in a way that 
we &apos;re able to do . We &apos;re developing into a community . Thinking , cordial beings . 
That &apos;s the truth . That &apos;s what I believe you to look at . 
Let &apos;s look at these interesting statistics . The recent by a researcher who &apos;s been researching Carnegie Mellon University , published this . The average young person of today , in a country with a strong playing culture , spends . 10 000 hours with online games , up to the age of 21 . 
So 10 000 hours is a time of very interesting numbers . So from two reasons , 
first of all , for children . In the United States , 10 080 hours is the exact total time you spend in the school , right ? From the five @-@ grade to the end of high school , right ? If you never miss it , 
so we have here a complete parallel education path where young people are learning the same thing that it means . A good player to be like being anything else , whatever they do in school , learning . 
And maybe you have some of them doing the new book of Malcolm Gladwell , &quot; Overflying Flyer . &quot; So you know his theory . Of success , the theory of success , the 10,000 @-@ hour theory . 
You &apos;re based on the great one . Research , cognitive science , that if we do 10,000 hours with the laborious study of a given subject , up to the age of 21 . Send will we be able to master . In that , 
we will be so good at whatever . Towards doing as the most important people of the world , 
that is , what we have here . Is it a complete generation ? Young people , the master players , 
are the big question . Is it what exactly are players ? Masterful , good . Because if 
we do that , if we could figure out , we would have never known anything before . Human potential for human 
potential , so many people , we currently have in the world the world that we have at least an hour a day playing online , 
these are our master players , 500 million people . The extraordinary good at something is 
something that is going to be in the next decade . Have we got another billion ? Players who are exceptionally good . In what &apos;s whatever , 
if they &apos;re doing it not yet , they &apos;re not listening . Have they got 
the gaming industry developed ? Consoles , the energy . Save and save on mobile networks . Instead of broadband Internet , so that players around the world are especially in India , China . Brazil online play can be expected to play . 
A further billion players in the next decade , 
so we have a total of 1.5 billion players , 
so I have started . So I started thinking about what it is , what these games are to master us . Make this one . 
Here are the four . Things that I found when I first came up with urgency optimism , 
OK ? Imagine if you could imagine extreme extremes of self @-@ motivation . 
Urgent optimism is desire . Immediately something to do . A hurdle to overcome together with a hurdle to believe that we &apos;re going to have a reasonable hope of success . 
Players believe always in believing that a epical victory is possible . And that it &apos;s always worth it , always trying . And that &apos;s equal to players . 
Sit &apos;s not around . 
Players are masters in spiders . Poet social networks . 
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research . The ones show that we people more like after we start working with them . Even if they let us face evil 
, the reason for that is because it &apos;s a lot of trust . With somebody , a game to play with , 
we trust that somebody will have time to spend with us . That the rules are being respected , that we have the same goal . And until the end of the game , so 
that allows us to play together , that &apos;s to grow ties , trust and with each other as a result . 
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re building stronger social relationships . We &apos;re building 
on happy productivity . Fantastic . 
You know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of Warcraft player is 22 hours a week . So , as part @-@ time job , 
the reason we play is that , if we &apos;re actually happier at it . Hard to work than if we &apos;re working relax . Or nothing . Do 
we know that we &apos;re acting as human beings optimally , as human beings ? If we &apos;re working hard , meaningful work , 
and players are always ready . Hard to work . If they &apos;re working the right job and 
eventually get epic meaning , 
players love . It &apos;s part of awe @-@ inspiring . Missions of planetary dimensions . Towards becoming 
here is a background information to this right in the light of this . You know , you probably all know Wikipedia . That &apos;s the biggest Wiki in the world , the 
second largest Wiki . That &apos;s the world with almost 80,000 entries . Is that the World of Warcraft ? Wiki 
: Five million people use it every month . 
They have more information . They have more information about the World of Warcraft online than they have about any other topic . In every other Wiki that &apos;s in the world , 
they create an epic . 
History : They create an epic . Source of knowledge about the World of Warcraft : 
OK . That &apos;s all four superpowers . The ones that are one result , players are super @-@ powerful , hopeful . 
Individuals : It &apos;s people who believe that they are as individuals , the world can change . 
And that only problem is that the only problem is they believe they can change the virtual worlds . But not the real ones . 
That &apos;s the problem . That &apos;s the problem . I try to solve Edward Castronova . 
That &apos;s a scientist , his work . 
Is it awesome ? He 
&apos;s studying why . People like that have so much time . Energy and money . In online worlds , he &apos;s spending , 
and he &apos;s saying , &quot; We &apos;re witnessing no less than mass emigration to virtual worlds . &quot; And online gaming environments , 
and this from an economist , so he &apos;s logical . 
And he &apos;s not saying the way I say , &quot; I &apos;m developing games . I &apos;m a little exuberant . 
&quot; So he says , &quot; This actually makes sense . &quot; Because players can play in online worlds more than they can in real life . 
They can do in games stronger social ties , Than in real life , they get more feedback . And rewards in games than in real life , 
so he does say it &apos;s currently in complete logic . That players have more time in the virtual world than in the virtual world than 
in real life . I agree with you . I agree with that . 
That &apos;s logical . But it &apos;s definitely . No optimal situation . 
We have to start to build the real world into a game . 
My inspiration comes from a moment of events that took 2,500 years to come . 
It &apos;s this ancient cube that &apos;s made of sheep &apos;s cocks , 
you know ? Before these fantastic game econtrollers , there were sheep &apos;s cocks , 
and these were , so to speak , the first of people to develop . Play equipment , and if you &apos;re working with the works of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus , you may know these stories . The story about how and why and why ? 
Play invented were made according to Herodotus . Games became more exact craps in the kingdom of Lydia during famine . 
Invented supposedly , there was such a big famine . That the king of Lydia was wondering about becoming a crazy idea . 
People were suffering because of people fighting . 
It was a extreme situation . You needed a extreme solution . 
So they invented , according to Herodotus , the craps and agreed a national strategy . At one day , you would eat . At the next day , you would play 
and they would play so much into the craps . Deepened . There . Games like this fascinating . Are and are with us more satisfying ? Happy productivity . Surrounded by that they would forget . That it &apos;s nothing to eat . 
And then , the next day , you would play , and the next day , you would eat 
and , according to herodotus , survived . They would survive 18 years of this famine . By making them live in one day and eat the next day 
, just like that , I think . Sit it today : We play , 
we set up games , to respond to the suffering of the real world . To escape , we set up games , to play to escape everything . That in the real world , not working . To everything that works in real life . Not satisfying . Is and we bring ourselves what we do need ? From the games , 
but that has to be not the end . 
That &apos;s the exciting , 
loud , herodotus . Was it 18 years after the famine not better , so decided the king to make one last cube game , and 
they shared the kingdom into two halves . 
They played one cube game . And the winners were allowed to become an epic adventure . 
Breaking up , they left lydia and made themselves up looking for the game . One new home , they just left just so many people behind as they left food for survival . And they were looking for the rest for an area where they were thriving . 
Could that sound crazy ? Or , 
but the latest DNA evidence ? Show that the Etruscans , who later became the Roman Empire , the same DNA as the Etruscans , the same DNA as the old Lydians . 
Have therefore come scientists recently to the view that herodotus @ crazy story actually is true ? 
And geologists found evidence of a global cooling down . The almost 20 years took , which was the explanation of famine . 
Could that mean that crazy story could be true ? Maybe 
they have actually their people , through games . Saved . By saving themselves 18 years . And then fleeing into games , and then this inspiration , they had . And so much about the interaction between them . Play learned that they learned from it that it saved the whole civilization . 
So , that &apos;s what we can play . 
We &apos;ve been playing since 1994 Warcraft . 
This was the first strategy game . In real time , the World of Warcraft series , 
which was 16 years ago . 
You played 18 years . Craps , we &apos;ve been playing for 16 years . Warcraft : 
I &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready . For our own epic game , 
so you sent the half half of your civilization . On the search for a new civilization , therefore , I &apos;m taking my 21 billion hours of play a week . We should be agreeing that 
the world is half of us , one hour a day , playing games . Until we start to address the problems of 
the real world . I know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; How do we solve problems of the real world ? &quot; In games and in 
that question , that &apos;s exactly the question I &apos;ve been doing in recent years at the Institute for the Future . 
We &apos;ve got this banner in our office . In Palo Alto , it expresses the way we put the future to understand . Should 
we want ? We don &apos;t want to try . The future before . To tell 
what we want is to tell the future . To create , 
we want to create the best possible outcome . Imagine and then people to empower them . These ideas in the reality of realizing , 
we face epic , epic victories . Imagine and give people the opportunities to make them reach them . 
I &apos;m going to show you very briefly . Three games , which I designed . Have to go to try and make people epic victories in their own future . To give them 
this is the world . 
Without oil , the game . Is the 2007 game 
? It &apos;s an online game . In the 2007 game , where they have to 
overcome oil shortages , oil shortages are invented . But we have enough online content to make it available to them realistically . And they have their real lives , in fact , without oil . Live , so if you go to the game . Say , &quot; Where do you live ? &quot; And then you get news movies in real time . The ones that show you how much oil costs . What it doesn &apos;t exist , how does food supply affect , 
how does it transport ? Does it affect schools , whether it &apos;s closed ? Are it whether it &apos;s uprising ? And they have to figure out how to get their real life done . If it &apos;s true and we &apos;re asking them to do that , blog about it . ( Video or photos ) 
We have this game with one in . 700 players . In 2007 , tested , and we have tested them since then over the last three years . 
And I can tell you it &apos;s been a changing experience . 
Nobody wants to live his life . Change because it &apos;s good for the environment . Or because we do . 
But if you &apos;re in an epic adventure , and you &apos;re told , &quot; Get us , oil is going out . 
&quot; That &apos;s a fascinating thing . Adventure . On the one you go to find . 
You find out how you survive . Would the majority of our players have ? The ones in the game would retain the habits that they learned . So they kept 
us in favor of the next world saving game , a bigger , higher goal . We put ourselves in favor of the next world saving game than just oil shortages . 
We have the game . Superstruct at the Institute . For the future . 
Developed starting point . Is the calculation ? One supercomputer that has people only to do 23 years on , and only 23 years left on , the planet . 
This supercomputer is called Global Dismortality Sensitization System , of course , the call . 
To players , to sign up . Have we almost , like a Jerry Bruckheimer film , 
made it ? They know Jerry Bruckheimer movies , where it &apos;s the dream team . They have the astronaut , the scientist , the ex @-@ Sträfling , and just together . Can you make the world save 
? But in our game , instead of just five people , instead of saying , &quot; Everyone is on the dream team , and it &apos;s our job . &quot; The future for energy , food , health . Safety and safety and the future of social justice to create . 8,000 
players played this . Eight @-@ game game . Weeks of 
time . They found 500 incredible . Creative solutions that they read about can be found if they Google Superstruct and the last game bring . 
We at the March 3rd , we figure out , it &apos;s a game . In collaboration with the World Bank , 
if you play the game , you get it . You get it from the World Bank , the award of Social Reformer 2010 , we work with universities . 
In all of Sub @-@ Saharan Africa , and invite you to redesign socially . To learn , 
we have a comic book on this . We have levels high for regional understanding . Knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and ingenuity . 
I want to invite you all to play this game with young people to share . Everywhere on the planet , especially around the world , in developing areas that benefit from it . Being together , sharing your own social ventures to imagine the world , to save the world . 
I come now to the end . 
I want to leave you with a question . 
What do you think ? Is it going to happen next ? 
We have all these fantastic players , right ? We have games that give us a picture of what we &apos;re doing . Can we do , but we have the real world not yet saved 
? Well , I hope you will tell me that you agree that players have human resources . The ones we &apos;re working on in real life can use and that games are a big deal of importance for change . 
We have these whole superpowers , happy productivity . The ability to have tight social networks . Urgency optimism and the desire for epiepical . Importance : 
I really hope that we together will have important games . To get on this planet another one century , 
to survive and I hope you will be able to join me in playing these games . Design and play . 
If I go to the next decade , I &apos;m going to be looking at two things . Certainly , we &apos;re going to have every imaginable future , and we &apos;re going to be able to play all kinds of games . Can we say , &quot; Let &apos;s make the world @-@ changing games . &quot; Let &apos;s start . 
Thank you . 
Since some time , I &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect . It may seem strange . That the world @-@ changing games are interested in , unless they look at it like this , as I think , a deception that leads to something real . If someone just gets stuck enough to believe in it , 
in other words , sugar pills have a measurable effect in some studies . The placebo effect , and that &apos;s because the person thinks it &apos;s what to do with it . Be a pharmaceutical . Or be a kind of pain management . Go for example , if the person is only stuck enough , there &apos;s a measurable , measurable effect in the body that you can call the placebo effect . 
A deception . Will become something real ? Because somebody does , because they perceive it like this . 
So that we can also understand each other , I want to give you an elementary , very simple magic trick . Let &apos;s show you , 
and I &apos;ll show you how it works . That &apos;s a trick . That &apos;s been a trick that &apos;s been in every children &apos;s magic book since the 1950s at least . 
I myself have him from the cub scout magic . The scout in the 1970s learned from the scout scout . 
I &apos;m going to do it for you . And he &apos;s going to explain it and then I &apos;m going to explain it . 
Why ? I &apos;m going to explain it . 
So , look at what &apos;s going on . 
That knife , the knife you can look at , my hand you &apos;re looking at . Can 
I ? I &apos;m just going to put that knife in my fist . 
I &apos;m going to push my sleeves back . 
And around the way , to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeves or comes out of it . Will I just get my wrist right here , 
just push it together ? On those lines , you can see . That the way you can &apos;t see anything moving at any time , as long as I &apos;m pressured here . Can &apos;t anything in my sleeve go ? Or come out 
and get the goal , and the simple thing is , 
I &apos;m going to open my hand . And hopefully , if everything goes well , it &apos;s going to go through my bare physical magnetism . It &apos;s stuck . 
It &apos;s actually so tight . It &apos;s in its place that I shake it . Without it being the knife falling down , nothing moves . 
In my sleeves or comes out of it , no trickery , and you can study everything . 
TA @-@ DA : 
Well , this is a trick that I often teach small kids . The ones who are interested in magic , because you can do a lot about deception , because you can learn a lot about deception . If you &apos;re looking at it more closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick to do . 
I think many of you here probably know about this . This trick , it works . 
So here &apos;s how 
I hold the knife . In my hand , 
I say that I &apos;m going to close my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears . Or comes out , and this is a lie . 
The reason why I &apos;m going to tie my wrist is because it &apos;s the real secret of the illusion . 
In that moment , when I &apos;m talking about my hand from you , I &apos;m going to turn away . So that you can pull it from behind , this finger moves here . My index finger just moves from there . Where it was , into a position in which it was so 
stretched out . 
Great trick . There &apos;s a guy sitting back there who 
had no childhood , so he &apos;s right here , 
and if I &apos;m turning around , the finger changes his position , 
and now you could talk about it . Why ? That &apos;s a deception . Why ? You don &apos;t perceive . That &apos;s down here just three fingers to see . Are they because the mind and the way in which it &apos;s processing information are not individually . Counts one , two , three . But they as a group sees , 
but that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about . Now here , actually , not at all . And then open up my hand , of 
course , it &apos;s held there . But not by the magnetism . My body , but by a trick . By my index finger , which is now there , 
and when I put my hand in , the same thing happens by turning back . By doing this motion , it &apos;s hidden that the finger is moving back , 
I take this hand away . And here &apos;s the knife . 
This trick can be done to your friends and neighbors . Thank you . 
Now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ? 
Well , a year ago or so , I read a study that really really bypassed me . Has I been ? 
I &apos;m not a doctor . Or a researcher , and that &apos;s why for me . It was an amazing thing . 
It has turned out this is what happens when you have a placebo in the form of a white pill . In the form of an aspirin tablet , that &apos;s easy . It &apos;s a round white pill . It &apos;s a certain measurable effect . 
But if you have the shape in the shape in which you give placebo to , for example , a smaller pill , you change it . And these blue color and a blue letter on it is the color that can actually be measured . More effective , 
even though none of them , any pharmaceutical ones , are . Just sugar pills , 
but a white pill is not so good . How a blue pill , 
what that made . I really . Flipping it out . 
It turned out , though , that &apos;s not all that . 
If you put capsules , they &apos;re still more effective than tablets , any form . 
A colored capsule , which is on one end yellow and on the other red . Is better than a white one ? Capsule @ capsule @ 
dosage . Does a role matter ? A 
pill twice . Daily it &apos;s not so good . Like three pills , I can &apos;t get myself on the pills right now , just remember 
the exact statistics . 
Does I &apos;m sorry ? That &apos;s the key thing 
, but the dosage is also a role . And the shape plays a role . 
And if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to grab the needle . 
Right ? A syringe . With a ineffective , a few milliliters , an ineffective one . Substance : The one you inject into a patient , 
which creates a very strong image . In your head , that &apos;s a lot . Stronger than a white pill , 
these graphs are really — I &apos;m going to give you another time , I &apos;m going to show you . If we have a projector , 
the fact is , the fact is , the white pill isn &apos;t working so well . How the blue pill , which isn &apos;t so good . How a capsule ? The ones that aren &apos;t so good . It &apos;s like the needle . 
And nothing of it . Has any really pharmaceutical ? Feature : It &apos;s just our faith in it . The one in us who has a stronger impact . 
I wanted to know if I could get this idea for a magic trick . 
Could I take something that &apos;s obvious , a deception ? And let it really be . 
Look at it . We know . Yeah . From that study , you can grab a needle if it &apos;s to the point . Should 
this be ? This is an 18 @-@ inch @-@ long hat needle . It &apos;s very , very sharp . And I &apos;m going to start by giving you a little sterilizing . That &apos;s 
this really my flesh . It &apos;s not Damian &apos;s . Special bred meat , this one . 
Is my skin ? That &apos;s not a special effect . It &apos;s from Hollywood . 
I &apos;m going to put this needle in my skin . And through it , I &apos;m going to push it until it &apos;s back on the other side . 
If you &apos;re going to get bad when you &apos;re easily fainted , I have this . I have some friends . Last night . Last night . In the hotel room , and some people I didn &apos;t know , and there &apos;s a woman almost fainting . 
She &apos;s become faint , so I propose , if you &apos;re going to get bad quickly , look for the next 30 seconds away . Or you know what ? I &apos;m going to be the first delicate part in the back here . 
You can do it in a moment . You can see it also if you look away . 
So , it &apos;s going to be so accurate here . Where my meat starts , at the bottom of my arm , I &apos;m just going to make a little bit of a break . Do 
I really ? Sorry . She &apos;s . That &apos;s crazy 
. And now , just . A little bit . Through my skin and on the skin and on the other side , out again . 
Now , we &apos;re actually in the same situation . The ones we do with the knife trick , 
about , 
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers . Or 
so I &apos;m going to tell you . That &apos;s one , two , three , four , five . 
Well , yeah . 
I know what the people think . If you think that 
, you say , &quot; Okay . &quot; The one is certain . Not so . Bold and pierced . Self . The skin , just around us , a few minutes to walk with . 
Now , then I &apos;ll tell you , I &apos;ll show you . 
How does this look like ? It looks pretty good . 
Yes . I know , and people in the back . Tell me , okay . I have this not really . I &apos;ve seen it . The 
people in the side rooms come now in . Let &apos;s 
let me tell you . From the nearby , show 
you this is really my skin . This is not a special effect . 
It &apos;s from Hollywood . This is my flesh . And I can do this around . 
I &apos;m sorry if you &apos;re getting sick . Look away . Look at it . Don &apos;t look at it . The 
people behind or the people behind , who eventually would like to watch this video . Will they say , &quot; Well , that looks pretty good . &quot; Impressive . Actually , but if it were real , he would see , you know , here &apos;s a hole . And there , if it was really real , it would bleed . 
Okay ? Let &apos;s let me just add a little blood to you . 
Yeah . Here &apos;s it . 
Normally it would be me now to take out the needle . 
I would take out my arm . And I would show you that there are no wounds there . 
But I think in this frame , here and with the one intent to do that . One deception , something real . Will I make the needle just there in ? Let &apos;s let it happen from the stage , we &apos;ll get into the next few 
days , and we &apos;ll go through it a few times . 
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . That &apos;s what I thank you very much . 
So I have a lot of life in my life known fish . 
I have only two loved . 
This first one , that was more like a passionate affair . 
It was a beautiful fish . It was tasty , good consistency . Hold , a bestseller . On the menu , 
what a menu , 
what better fish it got . In aquaculture after aquaculture , supposedly the highest standards of sustainability , you could grow , 
so you could feel comfortable . It was selling it . 
I had this beauty , I had a relationship over several months , 
one day the boss of the company called , and asked if I was growing up at an event . Could I talk about the sustainability of the farm 
? Of course , I said , 
&quot; Here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem for our chefs had become . Is it like , do we keep fish ? On our menus in 
the last few 50 years , we &apos;ve been looking at fishing the seas . How do we keep forests bare 
? It &apos;s hard to get rid of destruction . 
90 percent of the big fish , which we love , the tuna , the curative butte , the salmon , the swordfish . They &apos;re collapsed . 
It &apos;s almost nothing more . There &apos;s 
so I guess there &apos;s going to be aquaculture left , or bad aquaculture . Fish farming , part of our future . 
Its many arguments against it . Fish farming plants pollute the environment , most of them , anyway , and they &apos;re inefficient . Take the tuna . Take a big disadvantage . 
It has a feed recovery of 15 percent to one , 
which is 15 pounds . Wild fish are . It &apos;s necessary to get a pound of farmed tuna , 
not very sustainable . 
It tastes not very sustainable either . 
Very good . So here was finally a company , at last . The one who tried to get it right . 
I wanted to support them . 
AM : The day before the event , I called the boss of public relations for the company . 
AM : Let &apos;s call him Don Don 
, said . I just said , &quot; The facts . Right ? &quot; &quot; Having your are famous for having them . &quot; So far out there in the sea . Growing them . That you &apos;re growing the environment not 
polluting , that &apos;s true . Said him , &quot; We &apos;re so far out there that the waste from our fish is distributed . &quot; Not concentrated . And 
then he added , &quot; We &apos;re in fact a separate one . 
These feed recycling of 2.5 percent to one percent , &quot; he said , 
&quot; the best in the industry , 2.5 percent . &quot; 
On one , great , 
2.5 percent to one , what feeds you sustainable proteins ? &quot; 
He said , &quot; Great . 
&quot; He said , &quot; I got up 
and that evening I lay in bed and thought , &quot; What the hell ? &quot; &quot; Is sustainable ? 
&quot; &quot; Protein . &quot; So the next day , just before the event , I called . Don : 
I said , &quot; Don , what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot; 
He said , &quot; He doesn &apos;t know . &quot; He &apos;s going to 
ask , &quot; Well , I telephoned a few people in the company , nobody could tell me a proper answer . Give me until I finally get to the leading biologist call me the guy . 
&quot; Also don don don said , 
&quot; What ? &quot; For example , are you ? Sustainable proteins ? Well 
, he mentioned some algae . And some fishmeal and then he said , &quot; Chicken pellets . &quot; 
I said chicken pellets . He 
said , &quot; Yes . &quot; Feathers , skin . Bone flour . Remnants . Dried and to feed . Processed , 
I said , &quot; How much percent of your food ? &quot; 
&quot; Is chicken in the assumption of maybe two percent ? 
&quot; Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent . Said he , &quot; 
I said , &quot; Don , what &apos;s sustainable ? &quot; That chicken in fish to feed ? It 
was a long break . There was a long break in the pipeline , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much . Chicken in the world , 
I loved myself , I loved this fish . 
No . Not . Because I was a self @-@ righteous connoisseur and a good man . 
That &apos;s me . Even 
no . I have no , actually , of this fish . Dear because I swear by God , the fish after this fish conversation , after chicken tasted . Has 
this second fish , this is a different fish ? Species of love story , 
it &apos;s the romantic species , the species where you ever ever better get your fish , the better you know . Learn to learn the fish . 
The more you love it . I have it first in a fish restaurant in southern Spain . 
A friend journalist . She had long been a friend of this fish . She had spoken about it . 
They have given us some sort of cuddle , and he 
came on the table . With a bright , almost shimmering white color . 
The cook had him cooked , 
&quot; Stop twice . 
&quot; Amazingly , he was still . Delicious . 
Who can buy a fish ? So good . Taste so good . After he cooked , 
I can taste it . I can &apos;t , but this guy can call it . 
We can call it Miguel . In fact , he &apos;s called Miguel . 
And no . He has the fish , not . He has cooked . And he &apos;s not a chef . At least to the way they cook and I under it , 
he &apos;s a biologist , and he &apos;s a biologist at Veta . La Palma , 
that &apos;s a fish rearing in the southwest . Corner of Spain , 
it &apos;s near the mouth . Des rivers Guadalquivir to the river Guadalquivir , 
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of Argentines , 
they grew meat cattle on what was essentially wetlands . 
They made this by doing this by leaving the land drained . 
They built these complicated sequences of this canals and they pushed them into water from the land , and they pushed it out of the land . And out there , into the river . 
Well , they couldn &apos;t make a difference . That this worked , not economically , environmentally , 
and economically . It was a disaster . 
It brought about 90 percent . The birds around , what kind of place , lots of birds . 
And so this is 1982 , when a Spanish company with environmental awareness bought the land , 
what did they do ? 
They did the river of water , the other way around . 
They did literally the lever , literally . 
Instead of the water pushing out , they used the channels to push the water back in . 
They flooded the channels . 
They created a 11 000 acres of land . Fish farming , perch , sea ash , shrimp . Eel . And in doing so , Miguel and his company have ecological destruction completely reversed . 
The farm is incredible . 
I mean , they have something like this never seen before . They &apos;re staring out . 
They &apos;re on the horizon . The one million miles away . Is and everything that they see is , flooded . Channels and these density , lush march . 
I was there in front of me not long ago . With Miguel , 
he &apos;s an incredible guy . Three parts : Charles Darwin and one part , a crocodile . To kiss , 
okay , there we were and fought . We were through wetlands and I and I chash and sweat , I have mud up to my knees , and Miguel keeps calm . A biology lecture 
here , he lifts a rare track . 
Now , he mentions mineral needs of phytoplankton 
and here , here &apos;s where he sees a pattern . From bundles , bundling it at him . The Tanzanian giraffe reminds you . 
It represents a rare glitaar , Miguel , the majority of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa . Spent in me , 
I asked him how he was going to be a fish expert . 
He said , &quot; Fish , I don &apos;t know . About fish , 
I &apos;m an expert on relationships . And 
then he goes and falls and falls into more talk . &quot; From rare birds and algae and algae and strange aquatic plants , 
and you know ? Me , not wrong . That was really fascinating . You know , the biotic community , Unplugged , so in the way 
it &apos;s great , but I was in love . 
And my head became weak . About this cooked piece of delicious fish that I was eating on the eve . 
So I got it interrupted . I said Miguel . How does it come about ? That your fish is so good at tastes 
. He showed up the algae . 
I know boy , the algae of phytoplankton . The relationships , that &apos;s incredible . 
But what do you eat ? 
How is the recycling of feed ? Well 
, he goes on . I &apos;ll tell you that it &apos;s such a rich system , it &apos;s like this . That the fish eat what they eat in the wilderness . 
The vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , that &apos;s what the fish feed . 
That system is like healthy , it &apos;s completely self @-@ explanatory . 
It &apos;s not food . 
The one from a farm belongs to its animals that don &apos;t feed , later on 
the day it drove . I went on this plot with Miguel . Around . And I asked him , &quot; I said for a place that was so natural to be , different from any place that I would like to be . On the one I &apos;ve ever been like , &quot; How do you measure success ? &quot; 
In that moment , it was when it was like a film director was asking for a stage change . 
And we bowed around the corner . And we offered ourselves , the most incredible sight . Thousands and thousands of pinkers flamingos . A literally pinker . Carpet , so far as the eye is . 
Is that enough ? Success . Said he , 
&quot; Look at her bellies . &quot; Look at pink . 
She &apos;s smuggling , slugging 
. I was totally confused . 
I said Miguel . &quot; Get away from being smuggled . &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t get your fish . &quot; 
&quot; Yes . &quot; Said he . 
&quot; We are losing 20 % . Percent of our fish and fish eggs are lost to birds . 
Now , last year , this was on this plot 600,000 birds . More than 250 different species . 
It &apos;s today the largest and largest , and one of the most important private bird reserves in Europe . It &apos;s become me . 
I said , Miguel is a well @-@ thriving bird population , not the last one to be reared on a fish farm . Does 
he want to shook his head ? No . 
He said , &quot; We &apos;re building extensively , not . Intensive . 
This is what we &apos;re building . Is this an ecological network ? 
The flamingos eat the shrimps . 
The shrimps eat the phytoplankton ever 
since the pinker , so the belly , the better the system . Okay 
? Let &apos;s let &apos;s think about that . A farm that has its animals not feeding . And a farm that has its success on the health of its predators , 
A fish rearing , but also a bird reserve . 
Oh , and by the way , these flamingos shouldn &apos;t even be there from the outset . 
They breed in a city 240 in a mile away . Where the soil quality is better for the nest building 
every morning , flies . They fly 240 in a farm . 
And every night , they fly 240 in a row . Back , 
they do that because they &apos;re doing the white line that &apos;s yesterday , the A92 highway . 
In fact , 
I had a very serious journey , which was to imagine a kind of penguins journey . So , I looked at Miguel , and 
I said Miguel . &quot; Fly 240 . Kilometers to the farm and fly , fly them . &quot; 240 kilometers back to the evening , 
do . You do that for the kids . He 
looked at me when he had me just had a song of Whitney Houston quoted as if 
he said , &quot; No , you do that . Because that &apos;s better food . &quot; 
I have not the skin of my lover . Fish mentioned . The delicious . Was and I like no skin of fish . I like it . Not sucked . I like it . Not . 
Crispy . It &apos;s this biting . Cowed taste . 
I cook almost never with it , and 
yet , when I put it in this restaurant in southern Spain , it has even not , after skin of fish . 
It tasted like sweet . And it was pure as if you had a bite from the ocean . 
I mentioned that to Miguel , and he nodded him , 
he said , &quot; The skin looks like a sponge . 
&quot; She &apos;s the last defense . Before anything happens in the body , 
she has become in the course of evolution , evolved . To avoid impurities 
and then he added , &quot; But our skin is water that has no impurities . &quot; 
Okay . A farm that has its fish not feeding . A farm that has its success measured by success in the success of its predators . 
And then it turned out to me , when he says , &quot; A farm that has no impurities , it undermines enormous . &quot; Because that water , which is through that farm , comes from the river Guadalquivir . In , 
it &apos;s a river . The river , all the things with it , that rivers that flow into today tend to do with them , they tend to do with them . Chemical pollutants , outflow of pesticides 
and when it turns through the river system , it &apos;s fought through , and it leaves , the water is . Clean than like it came in , 
the system is so much healthy . It cleans the water . 
So , not only a farm . The ones that don &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that can succeed in health care for their predators . But a farm that literally measures a water treatment plant , not just for these fish , but also for you , And me , 
because if the water flows out , it sinks into the Atlantic , 
a drop in the ocean , I know , but I take it , and you should . Do it because this love story , romantic , is always . It &apos;s also instructive . 
You could say that it &apos;s a recipe , for which it &apos;s for the future . Good food , whether we &apos;re eating perch or meat cattle , 
what we need now . Is it a radically new thing ? Concept of agriculture , of a farm in which food is actually good . 
But for many people , that &apos;s a little bit too radical . 
We &apos;re not realists . We enjoy , we enjoy . Are 
we lovers ? We love weekly markets . We love small family farms . We talk about regional food . We eat organic food . 
And if you say that this is the stuff that &apos;s the future of good food insurance . Is anyone somewhere on the line and says , &quot; Hey guys , I love pink . Flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ? &quot; 
How are you going to feed the world ? 
Can I honestly be honest . 
I like these questions . Not no . 
Not . Because we already have enough calories produced . To feed the world more than just to feed the world , 
a billion people will . Today , a 
billion are starving . That &apos;s more than ever before . Because of stark inequalities in distribution , not the total production . 
Now , I like this question . Not because it &apos;s logic of our food system , the last 50 years of which has been determined . 
Feed grain . At vegetable eaters , pesticides , monocultures , chemicals , to the Earth . Chicken at fish and the whole thing , all the time , the agricultural industry just asked . If we were to make more people eat cheaper , how horrible can that be ? That 
was the reason , it was the justification , it was the business plan . The American agriculture , 
we should -- we should call it . What they are is a business in liquidation , a business that &apos;s quick to take up ecological capital , which is what enables that very production . 
That &apos;s not a business . And it &apos;s not agriculture . 
Our grain chamber is now threatened . It &apos;s not because of decreasing . Intake , but because of decreasing resources . 
Not because of the latest mowers and tractor inventions , but because of fruitful ones . Country : Not by pumps , but by fresh ones . Water : Not by chainsaws . It &apos;s by forests . And not by fishing boats . And nets , but by fish in the sea . They 
want the world to feed . Let &apos;s 
let &apos;s start with the question of , how are we going to feed ourselves ? 
Or better ? How can we create conditions ? The conditions that enable each community to self @-@ feed 
to feed that to do . Look at this , not the agricultural industrial model for the future . 
It &apos;s really old . And it &apos;s done . 
Capital , chemistry and machines . Are they on top of it ? And it has never had anything really good to eat . 
Is it produced ? Let &apos;s look instead at the ecological model . 
That &apos;s the one that &apos;s on two billion years of work experience . It &apos;s a retrospective . 
Look at Miguel . Farmers like Miguel . 
Farmers like Miguel . Farmers who don &apos;t have worlds for themselves . Are farms that restore ? Instead of using up farms that grow extensively , instead of just intensive farmers , who not only are producers . But experts for relationships . 
Because they &apos;re the ones who are experts for taste , too . 
And if I really , honestly , I think they &apos;re a better cook . As I did , when I ever know , 
you know , that &apos;s right . Because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious . It &apos;s a 
thank you . 
I grew up with a lot . Portion of science fiction 
in my life at school , I drove with the bus . To school , every day , an hour per way . And my 
nose stuck always in the same book . To a science fiction book , that &apos;s my thoughts . In other worlds , kidnapped and on narrative terms , my deep . In me , insatiable curiosity . 
Satisfied these curiosity . Showed up also in this . That I always , whenever I &apos;m not in school , when I was through the woods , strove . Wandered and rehearsed and collected frogs . And snakes . And beetle And pond water , everything . After home , brought home and under the microscope , 
I looked at , I was totally science @-@ thrilled . 
You know , it was always going on , trying . The world to understand and the world to understand the limits of what was possible , 
and my love of science . Fiction seemed to be in my environment to reflect , because back then , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea . 
Jacques Cousteau came to our living rooms with his fascinating shows , and he was very interested in the world . The ones that we see , animals and places and a world of wonder . The ones we used to have never imagined before 
, and that &apos;s what I think it &apos;s all about . So to that science fiction role , 
and I was an artist . 
I could draw . I could paint . 
And because it was not video games , nor this saturation , with computer @-@ generated films , nor the whole visual language . In the media landscape , I had to give the pictures in my head . 
That had to be what we all had when we were kids , reading a book , we took the author &apos;s description and projected it onto it . The canvas in our heads 
, my reaction to it . Was that drawing and painting ? From aliens aliens alien worlds , robots , spacecraft and all that . 
IM Mathekurs was me constantly taught by the teacher . How I got behind the textbook hidden 
around painting , creativity had to sort of get out . 
And there was something interesting happening , which actually happened to me at Jacques Cousteaus shows . Was the idea of a &quot; us &quot; completely unknown world ? Here on our planet itself , certainly , 
I would never have a alien world with an alien ship , I would never reach . That seemed to me to be pretty unlikely . 
But here was a world that was me , actually , able to enter . Here on the Earth . And you know , it was just as fascinating . And exotic as all of what was I was always imagining . When I was reading these books , 
so I decided , as I was 15 , when I was a diver , I was going to become divers . 
That only problem with this was that I was in a small village in Canada , in Canada . One thousand miles from the next ocean . 
A few miles away from this . And let it go . I let it not go . 
I discouraged . I was annoyed by my father . Until he finally got a diving school in Buffalo , New York , he had found out . Right on the other side of the border , where we lived , 
I made my diving certificate in a pool . The YMCA in the middle of winter in Buffalo , New York , 
the ocean . But one real ocean got me . I got only two years . Later on , to see . When we looked to California 
since then , in the 40 years since , which have passed . Have I got about 3,000 hours ? Under water ? 500 hours of that in submersible boats , 
and I &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea itself is in the flatter oceans , so rich in fascinating life . Is like us , it really is hardly imagined ? Can the imagination of 
nature know what it is ? No limits . No limits . Unlike our own miserable . 
Human imagination to this day , I find profound awe . For that which I have to say on my dives 
and my love for the ocean . Keep on with the same intensity as ever and with 
the same intensity as I have , then , as an adult , chosen a profession . It was filming . 
That seemed to be the best way to make my inner urge . Stories to tell with my need , images to create . 
To unite when I was a kid , drawing . I was constantly drawing comic books . And so , 
so films were the way , pictures and stories . To merge that . That was what fit . 
Together , of course , the stories I was choosing were the stories . From the science fiction field : Terminator Aliens . And Abyss at Abyss . Could 
I get my preference for the underwater world and diving ? With filmmaking , you know ? Connect that , 
so intertwined . Connect , kind of , my two passions , 
something interesting . Did it happen at Abyss ? Around a narrative problem in this one movie , to solve , and that was , we had to do something like create a liquid water system . We took a computer @-@ generated animation , CG . 
What was coming out of this was the first computer @-@ generated soft surface figure . The ever @-@ in @-@ a @-@ movie version 
of the film brought , although it didn &apos;t bring money . A very , very accurately , he just played his production costs . A , but I noticed something fascinating . This audience on the whole world , I think , was hypnotized . From the magic that 
started out loud Arthur Clarke &apos;s law , as you know , advanced technology . And magic is no longer . Of each other , 
they saw each other a magical thing . 
And that found me incredibly exciting . 
And I thought to myself , &quot; Wow , that absolutely must be involved in film art . Will you ? &quot; 
So we went to Terminator . Two , my next movie , a lot further . 
Together with ILM , we created there the guy . From liquid metal , success was hanging all over it . How this effect arrives would come , 
and it worked . Again , we had something magical created . And the effect in the audience was the same , but we did with the film already have a little more money in it 
, from these two experiences . So starting with this , a whole new world . It reached a whole new world . It reached creativity for filmmakers , 
so I started a company together with my good friend , Stan Winston , who became one of the best artists in the making and creature at that time , called Digital Domain . 
The basic idea of this company was to start the phase of analog processes . With optical printers , etc . , skip and go straight away with digital productions . 
That was what we did . Then we did , and we did , for a while , 
a competitive advantage . But in the mid @-@ 1990s , we realized that we had to be in the Creature and Character Design , for which we actually founded the company . Did we 
have progressed too slowly ? I had this piece Avatar . Written . That &apos;s the bar in visual terms . It &apos;s the bar in computer @-@ generated effects , all new heights . Put it up with realistic , human expressive characters , which are made using CG . And the main characters should all CG be . And the world should be CG @ CG . 
But the bar pressed very nicely , very back , and people in my company said , &quot; I think for the time being , we haven &apos;t been able to do that . 
So , I shifted that , and I did this other movie . &quot; About that big ship , which goes 
down , the studio , I used that as Romeo and Juliet on a ship , I sold it . It became a love movie of epic proportions , a passionate movie . Secretly 
, but I actually wanted to become a real wreck . The Titanic , diving 
down , so I made the film . 
That &apos;s the truth . That studio knew that , but it didn &apos;t . I have it , 
but I convinced it by saying , &quot; We dive to the wreck . We film . &quot; That real wreck , 
we &apos;ll do it in the opening sequence of the film . 
That &apos;s tremendous , important . It &apos;s a good trailer . It &apos;s for marketing , 
and I persuaded you to do an expedition . It &apos;s like , &quot; Finance 
sounds crazy . &quot; But that can be done again . It &apos;s because the one &apos;s imagination , a reality , creates a reality . 
Can we create ? &quot; Then actually , six months later , a reality where I got into a Russian submersible boat , I found myself . Four kilometers below the surface of the North Atlantic and me , the real Titanic , through a bullet . That was 
not a movie . No HD , that was real . 
So , that got me really bypassed . 
And the preparations for that were enormous . We had to have cameras and headlights and everything and everything . 
And I fell on how much I noticed these deep @-@ sea dive gears . One space mission looked 
like , &quot; Well , yeah . They were also high @-@ tech . And they needed extensive planning . 
You go up . You go into that capsule , you float into that dark , hostile environment . Down where there is no hope . On rescue there is , if you don &apos;t return it yourself 
and I thought to myself , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s the same as if I were in a science fiction movie . 
&quot; That &apos;s real cool . I 
was pretty obsessed . I was obsessed with exploring the deep sea , at least the part 
that was interested in curiosity and science . Has it been ? It was all . It was adventure . It was curiosity . It was imagination . 
And it was an experience . It was an experience that Hollywood could not give me , 
because , you know , I could imagine a being for which we would then have a visual effect . Could , but I could not imagine that . What I could imagine outside the window was what I saw . 
Would it be that some of the expeditions that followed , I would see beings in thermal springs ? And sometimes things that I still see before , things I &apos;d never seen before , sometimes things that nobody had ever seen before . And for those who have science to do at the time we saw it , none of the words . 
Found . Had that found me ? So , right ? Was that turned me around , and I wanted more , 
and so I met . A little unusual . Decision after decision 
after success . From Titanic , I said , okay . I want my main job . When I was a filmmaker in Hollywood , I &apos;m going to put it on ice for a while , full 
@-@ time explorers , and then we started planning these expeditions . 
We showed up to Bismarck and we explored them with robotic vehicles , and 
we went back to the wreck . The Titanic , 
we took little little robots . The ones we had built , which are running a fiberglass cable , 
our intention . We wanted to dive in and get inside the ship , which never did before , what had been done . 
Nobody had ever had the inside of the wreck explored . You had another one , you had no means . You had no means to do that . So we developed the technology we needed . 
So , there we are , and I &apos;m sitting on the deck . The Titanic . In a submersible boat , and I see planks planking these boards here that are quite similar . And from those I know are the ones that the band used to play there . 
And I &apos;m flying with a little robot vehicle through the aisles . 
Des Schiff : I &apos;m operating it , actually , but my consciousness is within the aisles of the vehicle . 
It felt like it felt like it was physically . Within the shipwreck of the Titanic , 
present , that was the surreal form . One déjà vu that I &apos;ve ever experienced , because before I was around one corner each , I knew I always knew what was going to be in the light cone of the vehicle . Would that , because I was going over the movie set for months ? When we saw the film , 
the set was actually a set , a copy . The blueprints of the ship 
, that was a very strange thing . 
Experience , it made me feel this telepresence experience . That you know , you use robotic avatars like this , and so you put your consciousness into the vehicle , into this different form . The existence of this can be laid . 
It was really incredibly profound . 
And maybe it could be a little bit of a view . It could be a little bit of a look at what might happen in a few decades . Could it be that if you have cyborg bodies to explore something ? Or other things to do ? In all sorts of post @-@ human future scenarios that I think I can imagine as a science fiction fan . 
After these expeditions , we started doing what we were down there , what we had seen . Really ? Estimate to learn . Learn , for example , these deep sea equals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . This is sort of alien . But here on Earth . 
They live with the help of chemosynthesis . 
They exist not in a species that is sunlight . They don &apos;t exist in a system that is based on sunlight . They exist in the way we do this . 
And this is how you see animals . The direct link between a 500 degree Celsius and a 500 degree Celsius water cloud is alive . And 
you can imagine that you can &apos;t imagine that you &apos;re surviving there . Can you live 
at the same time interested ? I &apos;m also very much in space science . That was again the science fiction influence . From my childhood and so it ended up landing at people &apos;s people who were interested in space , 
and I was very interested in space . And the people with NASA , NASA , have to do with NASA , sit on NASA &apos;s expert board and plan real space missions . They &apos;re going to Russia . They &apos;re going through before the mission . They &apos;re going through the biomedical protocol , including the biomedical protocol . Everything about it and everything . They &apos;re going to fly to the international . Space Station and take our 3D camera systems with them . 
That was fascinating . 
But at the end of the day , it went on . That I was a space scientist with us into the deep sea . 
I took them with me and I was going to give them access to the world . And down there , astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were committed to these extreme situations . I took them to the sources , with them , so they could look around , take samples . And instruments test . And so , and so on . 
We turned , indeed , documentaries were made , but actually science , more specifically space science , 
so the circle closed . Between my existence as a science fiction fan , then as a child , and implementation . 
In the reality , over the course of this discovery journey , I learned a lot . 
I learned a lot about science . But I learned a lot about science , too . 
Now , think about leadership , I &apos;m sure a director must lead . Can a leader be ? How can a ship captain or something ? I understood , but 
I didn &apos;t understand much . I understood leadership before I started these expeditions , 
because on a certain point , I had to tell myself , &quot; What am I doing ? &quot; Actually , here &apos;s 
why . Make me do that . What &apos;s going on ? Out of this stupid movie 
, these stupid movies don &apos;t bring us money . A &quot; We Play 
Just &quot; -- the production cost . A one of fame , no trace . 
Everybody thinks , I &apos;m between Titanic . And Avatar walked away and would have gone somewhere to get the nails on a towel . 
AM Strand , I &apos;ve all been celebrating these movies , these documentary films for a very small audience . 
I didn &apos;t make fame . No honor . No money . What are you doing ? Only 
you &apos;re doing it . To get to the task , to face the challenge and the ocean is the most challenging environment . The ones that exist , you &apos;re doing it of exploratory noise . Because of and because of the strange connection that emerges when a little group of people are creating a team . 
Because we have all of this with just 10 to 12 percent people , and we &apos;ve done it . The ones that have worked together for years , and we &apos;ve been sometimes two to three months in a row at sea 
and in this community . Recognize that you have the most important thing : Respect is the respect that you have for each other . Because you have a task to do . The one you don &apos;t know anyone else can 
explain if you return to land . And you say , &quot; We had to do it . &quot; That fiberglass , the sound attenuation and the whole around it , the whole technology . And the difficulties , the human performance . If you look at sea , you can work at sea , you can &apos;t explain that to the other . That &apos;s like the policemen or policemen or soldiers . The ones that went through something together , and they know they never could explain it to anybody . 
There &apos;s a connection . There &apos;s mutual respect . 
So when I came back to see my next movie , Avatar . So I tried to make the same leadership style . And that was that you respected your team and you turned back to their respect . And that 
made the dynamics really change . 
And there I was again . So with a small team on unknown terrain , we turned Avatar with a new technology , and we did it . And it was the technology that had not existed before , 
incredibly exciting . 
It was a tremendous challenge , 
and we became incredibly exciting for a period of four and a half years to become a real family . 
And so this changed my way of making films . And 
so , it completely changed . Was there people who thought we had these ocean properties , yeah , really good ? So they were mimics and they were transported to Pandora &apos;s planet , and 
for me , it was more of a basic way of doing my job . And doing that , the actual process , which results in change . 
Has what can we do ? So from all of that 
, what lessons do we have ? 
We &apos;ve learned . I believe in the first place . 
Is the curiosity ? It &apos;s the most powerful human property . Our 
imagination is a force that is even a reality that creates . Can 
and can respect your team &apos;s respect be . More important than all the laurels of this world to me . 
Come on , young filmmakers who say , &quot; Give me a gift . &quot; A advice like me , like I do something like this . And 
I say , &quot; Don &apos;t limit you . &quot; Even 
a guy who &apos;s worried about this . Others for you , do not do it . You yourself , bet . Not against yourself . Even , take it . Risk . Risk on you . The 
NASA . Has NASA got such a favorite sentence . Failure . Is not an alternative ? But 
in the arts and in the exploration , failure has to be an alternative . Because there , it guarantees a trust advance , not 
an important one . Undertaking that innovation . Demanded it was ever made without risk , 
you have to be ready to take those risks on 
yourself . That &apos;s the idea . That &apos;s the idea I &apos;d like to share with you . Failure is quite a failure . Fear , however , is not a thank you . 
If I can tell you one thing today , it &apos;s a fact that the whole of the data we consume is larger than that . As the sum of your parts and instead of just overloading information , rather than thinking about it . Does I want you to think about it ? How we can make use of information in a way that creates patterns ? And we can make trends that recognize otherwise not visible . 
We would have become something like this that we see here . Is it a typical death chart ? After age , 
arranged the program , which I &apos;m using here , is a little experiment . 
It &apos;s called Pivot . And what I do with Pivot is what I can do with Pivot after a certain cause of death . Can I say accidents 
and instantly , I see a different cause ? Patterns : The pattern that emerges , 
and that is because in the middle , here , people are most active . And they &apos;re over here , most frail , 
we can have a step further out and sort out the data , then . And you can see that circulatory diseases and cancer , the usual suspects , are . But not for everyone , 
if we &apos;re going to go further now and sort by age , say 40 years or younger , we can see that accidents are even the main cause . About the ones that people worry about , people should worry about , 
and who &apos;s looking at them . That &apos;s this particular case for men . That &apos;s true , 
so you realize that the image of information and data in this way is very much swimming . In a living information graph , 
and if we remember this for raw data , why can &apos;t we do this for content itself ? 
What we &apos;re doing here is what we have the cover images of each individual . Sports Illustrated , who ever were printed . 
It &apos;s all here . It &apos;s all online . 
It &apos;s all online . You can test it after my talk in your rooms . 
With Pivot , you can dive in . In a decade , 
you can dive in , you can dive in , in a given year , 
you can jump directly to a particular issue . 
If I &apos;m here to look , I see the athletes who are in this issue appearing . And the sports , 
I &apos;m a Lance . Armstrong @ arms.arms.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts@@ Fan : So I click here . What &apos;s going on to show me all the expenses Lance Armstrong mentions , right ? Now 
, if I just want to give a bigger picture . I want to think , OK ? What if I wanted to do everything with the subject of cycling ? Look at it , 
so I &apos;m going to take a step back . And I &apos;m going to expand the perspective . 
Now , I &apos;m looking at Greg Lemon , 
and so you get an idea . Of the fact that if you look at information in this way , you zoom in more targeted , wider , more pure , you don &apos;t look for it . Or you don &apos;t surf . Just just 
you . You do something that actually does a little bit differently . 
It &apos;s something in between . And we think it changes the way that you do it . 
Can I want to use this idea now , a little bit further ? With about what a little crazy , a little bit . 
What we &apos;re doing here is what we &apos;ve got every single wikipedia page taken , and put it on a little summary . 
The summary contains a short overview of this . And a symbol of the area , from there . The one that comes out of it , 
I &apos;m just going to show you the top 500 of the most popular . Wikipedia pages , 
but even in this narrow view , we can see a lot of things . 
Immediately , we get a sense of what the issues are . The ones on Wikipedia are the most popular , and 
I &apos;m going to vote on the government issue . 
Now , after I &apos;ve elected government , I realize that the Wikipedia categories that are on the most cover . Time Magazines : People of the Year . 
Are these ? Is this really important ? Because this is a realization that is not in a single individual Wikipedia page . 
This is just too recognizable . If you want to go one step back and look at the whole thing , 
looking at one of these summaries . Can I then go into the subject of Time ? Magazines , People of the Year , and everybody together can see when I go all the time , 
looking at all these people , I realize that the majority of them are government officials . Some of them come from science . Some of them come from even less business . Here &apos;s my boss . And one of them comes from music , 
and interestingly , Bono . Bono is also a TED Prize . Winners , 
so we can jump now and get a look at everybody TED Prize . 
Winners throw you , you see , we surf . IM WEB : The first time you &apos;re like it really does , it &apos;s a web . Not only from side to side , but a lot more abstract . 
And so , I want to show you something else . What a little surprise is , what 
I &apos;m showing you . Let me just show you the New York . Times website : 
Pivot , this application . I don &apos;t want a browser to call it . It &apos;s really not a browser . But you can do websites with it . And we bring these zoom technology to every single website . How this ? 
I can . So , a step back . And right back to a specific section , jump . 
That &apos;s why it &apos;s important because you can only go through looking at websites of this kind in this way . The whole Internet history to the same way , in the same way . 
I can therefore look at my course , zoom in in in a 
certain time frame , and here &apos;s the state of play . The whole demonstration , which I &apos;ve been holding up to this point , 
and I can sort of see everything I &apos;ve been looking at today . 
Again , bring back . And if I go back a step , and I go back and look at everything . I can see my course rearranged . Maybe after my search past here , I went to search for nepotistic . Here , after Bing , or here , after Live Labs , Pivot , 
and from here , I can go into the page . And you can call it again . 
It &apos;s a metaphor . It &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again , and every time it does that . Overall picture bigger . Than the sum of the data parts 
at the moment in this world thinking . We think data is a curse . 
We talk about that curse of curse of information abundance , 
we talk about drowning in information . 
What if we could do about this situation ? And that Internet on the head . So we could turn this situation around , instead of always moving from one to the other . From many things to many things to many things . To be able to go and see patterns that otherwise have been hidden . 
If we could do this , then it will be this data trap that we &apos;ve seen so far , maybe a new source , more meaningful . Information 
and instead of just just getting into information . To move can be known from it , we can get knowledge from it . 
And if we know , then then we can maybe even even know wisdom from it . 
So that &apos;s what I stop hearing . Thank you very much . 
Everybody talks today about the happiness of happiness . 
I have some people who have the number of books . Let &apos;s have the number of books with happiness in the title in the last five years . And they gave up after about 40 , and it was there , a lot more . 
It &apos;s a huge wave of happiness interest in it . Happiness among researchers . 
There &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching . 
Everybody would like to make people happier . 
But despite all of this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps . The ones that , it &apos;s kind of impossible to think about happiness clearly , 
and my talk today is going to be . And it &apos;s mainly these cognitive traps that act . 
That &apos;s the case for laymen who are talking about their own happiness . And it &apos;s the case for scientists who think about happiness because the result is that we &apos;re just as confused as that . How everyone else who &apos;s 
the first of these traps is a reluctance to complexity . To admit , 
it turns out that that word &quot; happiness &quot; is simply not a useful word anymore . Because we do it on too many different things , too many different things . 
I think it &apos;s a certain one meaning on which we apply it to . Could it be , however , by and large , something that we give up ? Will it have to be , and we will take the complicated view ? Do we have to take what well @-@ being is ? 
The second case is a confusion . And memory in fact is that it &apos;s between happiness . In its life and happiness , it &apos;s about its life or happiness . It &apos;s about its life , 
and these are two very different concepts . And they &apos;re both thrown together . In the idea of happiness and happiness , 
and the third is the concentration illusion . And that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we have . That we don &apos;t have a circumstance to think about . The well @-@ being affects without its meaning . To distort , 
I mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive trap . 
It &apos;s just not a way . It &apos;s right . 
To get there . Well , I &apos;d like to start with an example . From someone who has a question and answer session after one of my lectures , who reported a story , unclear , he said he &apos;d heard a symphony . And it was absolutely magnificent . ( Music ) And at the very end of the recording , there was a terrible one . Creating sound 
and then added a terrible one . Really ? Pretty emotional . That &apos;s what all the experience is . Ruined , 
but that was not what it was . What it ruined was 
what it ruined was memories of the experience . 
He had the experience . 
He had 20 minutes of wonderful . 
( Music ) She counted not . Because he had a memory , because he had stayed with . The memory was ruined . And the memory was everything that was he had to keep to . He had 
what this really tells us . Is that we &apos;re talking about ourselves and about other people , right ? Could we think about ourselves in terms of two kinds of 
self ? There &apos;s a self that is alive in the present . And the present knows how capable it is of rebuilding the past . But in fact , only the present . Has 
it ? It &apos;s the living self . That &apos;s what the doctor is acclaimed . You know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Is it doing it now ? &quot; &quot; Woe if I hurt you here 
and then there &apos;s a problem with a memory self . &quot; And that memory self is that memory self that &apos;s widening . And that story of our lives , maintains and keeps it upright , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor is addressing . By doing that , by asking the question , &quot; How did you have felt lately ? &quot; 
Or , &quot; How was your journey ? &quot; After Albania or something ? Similar . 
This is two very different entities . This survivor himself and the memory itself . And the two , to confuse , is part of the way in which they were united . Of the term happiness . 
Now , the memory self . Is a storyteller ? 
And that starts really with a story @-@ telling reaction . It starts with our memories . It starts immediately . 
We tell not only stories when we tell ourselves about it , but also stories when we make it . Stories about telling 
our memory . Stories tell us stories . That means what we &apos;re talking about from our experiences is what we can keep is a story . 
And let &apos;s not let it go with an example . 
It &apos;s a old study , 
which is real patients , who are one of the painful procedures , and 
I &apos;m not going to go into detail . You know , it &apos;s no longer painful today . But you know , it was painful . When these studies were done in the 1990s , 
they became real patients , and they were asked to go to their pain every 60 seconds . And 
here &apos;s two patients . That &apos;s their records . 
And they &apos;re asked , who of both has more suffered from both ? And 
that &apos;s a very simple one . 
Patient B has clearly more suffered from this . His intestinal reflection was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient A had . Had patient B and more , 
but now there are a few different questions . How much did these patients think ? That they suffered 
and here &apos;s where a surprise is . And 
the surprise is that patient is patient A , much worse reminder of the intestinal reflection , had . When patient B , 
the stories of intestinal reflections , were different , and because a very critical part of the story is . How they end 
and not one of these stories is very edifical . Or great , but one of them is this : Clear , but one of them is clear . Worse than the other , 
and the one that is worse , the one where the pain was all at the end of its peak . It &apos;s a bad story . 
Where do we know that ? 
Because we know these people after they &apos;re being shown in their intestinal reflections . And also , much later . How bad was that all thing ? Overall , 
and it was much worse . For A , than for B , in memory , 
well , that &apos;s a direct conflict . Between the survivor himself and the survivor himself and the remembering self , 
from the viewpoint of the survivor . Even had B clearly had a worse time . 
Now , what you do with patient A , and we could have actually clinical experiments , and we did . And it &apos;s done . It &apos;s been done . And it works . You could actually do the intestinal reflection of patient A by extending it simply by just putting the tube in it . Without it being too much on it , the tube becomes 
that , right ? That the patient suffers , but only one little bit and a lot less than before . 
And if you do that a few minutes , you have a few effects . That that survivor himself is made by patient A. worse off than that . And you have a result that that memory self is made by patient A. much better off with it . Because now , you have patient A. A better story about patient A. What 
does it draw from ? What does a story look like ? 
And that &apos;s true of stories . The stories that memory gives us , and it also applies to patient A stories . The stories that we invent , which 
make a story unique . Are upheavals ? Significant moments and ends . 
Ends . Are very , very important . And in this case , the dominant end 
now was the living self , lives . His life is continuous . 
It has moments of experience . It has one after the other , 
and you ask , what happens to these moments ? 
And the answer is really simple : You &apos;re for ever lost . 
I mean , most moments of our life and I have lost that , of all things . You know , the psychological presence . Does it seem like three seconds ? Long , what does knowledge mean ? Do you know that in a life it &apos;s about 600 million of them . In a month , there &apos;s about 600 000 of them , most of whom leave . No trace that 
most of you leave . Will they be completely ignored ? Of the memory self , 
and yet , somehow , they get the impression . That they count . That what &apos;s going on during these moments of experience , our life , is . 
It &apos;s the limited resource that is available to us . While we &apos;re on this planet , 
and how we use it , we are using it . Would it seem important ? But that &apos;s not the story . The ones that remind ourselves for us keeps that memory self , 
so we have the memory . Even and that living self and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different . 
The biggest difference between them is that they deal with time , and they do . So 
from the perspective of the living self . If you have a vacation and you have the second week , just as good . Is it like the first ? Then the two @-@ week . Holiday twice as good as the two @-@ week . 
Holiday as it works . It doesn &apos;t work at all . For that memorative self , 
for that memorative self , is a two @-@ week vacation . Hardly better than the one @-@ week holiday , because there are no new memories added . 
You have the story , not changed . 
And on those terms , time is actually the critical variable , actually . The one that is a remembering self is different from a living self , time . Has very little influence . It has very little influence on this story . 
Well , the remembering self makes more than remembering . And stories about telling 
it is , actually , the one . That decision makes , because if you make a patient who has a patient who , let &apos;s say , has two intestinal reflections with two different surgeons . Had and had decided which one he chooses . Should then be , is the one who chooses ? The one who chooses the memory , the less bad . And that &apos;s the surgeon , the one who is selected . 
Will that survivor himself have ? No voice . In this election , actually , 
we don &apos;t vote . Between experiences , we choose between memories of experiences . 
And even if we think of experiences in the future , we think of our future . Normally not as experiences , 
we think about our future . After , as anticipated memories , 
and basically , they can do that . You know , as a tyranny of remembering self and you know , you can do the remembering self . As one , which is , so to speak , the living self . Put through experience . The ones who live the living self . Not needs me . 
I have the impression that if we leave , that &apos;s very common , very often the case , that &apos;s to say . We do vacation as much as possible . In the service of the memory self , 
and that &apos;s a little hard . To justify , I think 
I mean , how much do we feed from our memories ? 
That &apos;s a one of the explanations that are used for dominating the memory self . 
And if I talk about that , I think about a vacation , which we &apos;re going to spend a few years ago in Antarctica . The one that &apos;s clearly the best vacation I &apos;ve ever had was . And I think relatively often about that in relation to how much time I think about other vacations , 
and I think I probably heard about my memories of these three @-@ week trips . I would say something like 25 minutes long . In the last four years , 
I &apos;ve been driving , well , if I &apos;d ever opened the folder with the 600 images in it , I &apos;d spent another hour . 
Well , that &apos;s three weeks . And that &apos;s at most one and a half hours 
, it seems . It &apos;s a disagreement . 
Well , I like a little bit extreme . You know , in that , how little appetite I have for feeding ? From memories , I have memories , but even if you do more of them , there &apos;s a real question . Why do we give memories ? So much weight in the scourge . Too much weight in the weight we give experiences , 
so I want you to talk about a thought experiment . 
Imagine if you think about your next vacation , you know that on the end of your vacation , all your pictures will be destroyed . And you get a amnesty drug . So you get yourself an amnesty drug , so you will remember nothing . 
Now , you would have the same vacation . And if you had another vacation , you would have a different vacation , there &apos;s a conflict . There &apos;s a conflict between your two kinds of self , and you have to think about it . How you can solve this conflict and that &apos;s really , really . Not obvious , because if you &apos;re in the sense of time , you get an answer . And if you think in the sense of memory , you could have a different answer , you could get a different answer . 
Why ? We , the vacations , choose . The ones we choose is a problem . That &apos;s what we face with a choice between the two , with a choice . 
The self , well , the two types of self , throw two terms . From happiness to happiness , 
there are actually two concepts of happiness : The happiness that we can apply . One per self , 
you can , therefore , ask , how happy is the living ? Even , 
and then you would ask , how happy are the moments in life ? Of the living self , 
and you are all happiness . For moments , a pretty complicated thing . Process , 
what are the emotions ? The ones that can be measured ? 
And by the way , we are now able to have a pretty good idea . To get from happiness , the living self , to time , 
when you look after happiness , the memory self , when you ask about happiness , it &apos;s a very different thing . 
That &apos;s not about it . How happy a person lives it ? Is 
it about how satisfied or happy ? The person is when this person lives about his or her life , 
very different terms , 
each of them who doesn &apos;t distinguish these terms . Will the research into happiness melt up ? And I belong to a lot of happiness researchers , about well @-@ being . The people who study happiness for a long time get bogged down . Have on exactly these kinds of things 
the distinction between happiness , happiness , happiness , the living self and happiness , memory self ? Is in the last few years recognized ? And now , we are trying to make the two separate . To measure 
the Gallup Organization , the Gallup Organization has conducted a global survey , in which more than half a million people . Questions asked . Have they been asked ? Have they been asked about what they are about their lives ? Do they think about their experiences ? And it was other efforts that were made in 
the direction of the past few years . We have started , then , about the happiness of the two kinds of self . 
And the main lesson that we have , I think , learned is that they really do differ from one another . 
They can know how satisfied someone is with his life . And that teaches them really . Not much about it . How happy he is . Life lives and vice versa . 
Only to give you an idea of the correlation to the correlation . The correlation is about five percent 
, which means that . Is that if you want to meet someone and you would meet them , &quot; Oh , his father is a two @-@ meter man . How much would you know about his size ? 
&quot; Well , you would know something about his size . But it &apos;s a lot of uncertainty . 
You have such a lot of uncertainty . 
If I give you a message that someone has lived his life as eight on a scale of 10 . Has one ? Have you got a lot of uncertainty ? That &apos;s how happy he is . With his survivor himself . 
The correlation is therefore low . 
We know something about it . What the satisfaction of happiness self determines 
? We know that money is very important . Targets are very important . 
We know that happiness is essentially about . Satisfied . Zu sein mit Menschen die we &apos;re like , Zeit zu verwenden mit Menschen die we &apos;re like , 
There are other pleasures , but that &apos;s dominant when 
you &apos;re so dominant , so the happiness of the two kinds of self maximize . Do you want to end up being very different things ? The conclusion from 
the point of view of what I have said here is that we are really not imagining happiness , really . When you replace it with well @-@ being , 
it &apos;s a completely different term . 
Now , very briefly , another reason for that is that we don &apos;t know how to think about happiness . Can &apos;t it be that we don &apos;t think about the same things ? If we think about life , we think about life , and if we actually live , 
so if you ask the simple question of how happy people in California are . Are they going to be the correct answer ? Are they going to get the right answer if 
they ask that question ? Do they think that people in California are happier ? If they say , &quot; We in Ohio live , 
and what happened ? &quot; That if they talk about life , in California , they think , think about the difference . Between California and others , and places like that , and that difference is , say , climate . 
Now , it turns out that it &apos;s climate not very important for climate to the living self . And it &apos;s not even very important , actually . It &apos;s very important for the thoughtful self , which decides how happy people are , 
but now because the thoughtful self is responsible . Can you do it in the end ? Some people could . AM : End up moving to California , 
and it &apos;s kind of interesting . So , tracking what happens to people . The ones to California , moving to hope that they &apos;ll be happier . 
Now , their self @-@ living is not going to be happier . 
We know that , 
but one thing is going to happen . They &apos;re going to think they &apos;re happier . Because if you think about that , you &apos;re reminded of it . Are they going to be how horrible the weather in Ohio was ? And they &apos;re going to feel they &apos;re getting the right decision . 
It &apos;s very difficult , very hard to think about well @-@ being . And I hope I have to tell you an idea of that . How difficult it is . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question . An answer to you . 
Thank you very much . 
Now , when we started a few weeks ago , when we telephoned , you told me that it was a pretty interesting result . That was from this Gallup survey . 
Is that something that was what you were sharing with us ? Let &apos;s be because you can now have a few minutes left . 
Daniel Kahneman : I &apos;m sure . 
I think that &apos;s the most interesting result . That we have in the Gallup survey is the one we found . Have a look at a number that we absolutely don &apos;t find . Expected . 
We found that in the perspective of the happiness of happiness of the survivor , even 
if we looked at how feelings with income are different 
and it represents the difference , it turns out that under an income of 60,000 dollars in a year , for Americans . And that &apos;s a very large , big sample . From Americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big sample , representative sample . Under one income of 600 000 , 000 dollars a year , 
about 60,000 . 
DK : 60,000 , 
60,000 dollars , 60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy . And they &apos;re getting increasingly unhappy . Ever poorer they get about 
it . We get an absolutely flat line . 
I mean , I rarely have that flat line . 
Seen what happens ? Is obvious that money is not going to give you experience happiness , but that lack of money certainly brings you misery , and we can get this misery very , very clear . 
In the sense of the other , even the remembering self , you get a different story . 
The more money you make , the more satisfied you are , the more satisfied you are . Is 
that not true of emotions ? 
CA : But Danny , throughout the American endeavor , it &apos;s about life . Freedom , the quest for happiness . 
If people want to be serious about this finding , I mean , it all seems to be upside down . Too upside down , everything we believe , for example , in terms of fiscal policy and so on . 
Is there a chance that politicians can have this country in general , a finding like the seriousness of taking it ? And that &apos;s based on that , would make politics . 
DK : You know , I think there &apos;s recognition . For the role of gambling research in the politics that 
recognition is going to play . Slowly , in the United States , no question , but in the United Kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now . And in other countries , it &apos;s happening . It &apos;s 
people who are recognizing that . That they &apos;re lucky enough to think . If they think about politics , 
it &apos;s going to take a while . And it &apos;s people who will discuss whether they &apos;re going to explore experiential happiness . Or whether they &apos;re going to explore life evaluation . So , we need to really have this discussion very soon . 
How to get lucky ? Well , it &apos;s very different . Depending on how you think and how you think about it , and whether you think about the memory self . Or whether you think about the living self , or whether you think about it . 
That &apos;s what will influence politics . Think about it in the years to come , 
in the United States , you &apos;re tightening up on the happiness of the people . 
You &apos;re measuring it , I think , in the next few , one or two decades , part of the national statistics . 
It &apos;s about , well , it seems to me that this topic is going to , or should , at least be the most interesting political debate to follow . About the next few years , 
many thanks . For the invention of behavioral economics , 
thank you , Danny Kahneman . Today 
I &apos;m going to talk to you . About energy and climate and climate 
and that might surprise you a little bit , because my full @-@ time work at the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds . Is it about things that we do invent and deliver that we need to do ? Is it about the poorest two billion , a better life for 
them ? But energy and climate are extremely extreme , right ? It &apos;s very important for these people , actually , to be more important than anyone . It &apos;s more important for others on the planet to 
get climate degradation , and their seeds will not grow for many years . It &apos;s us too much , or too little rain . It &apos;s things that will change that way . It &apos;s how it changes their fragile environment . It &apos;s not sustainable . 
Can that do that ? It causes starvation . It leads to insecurity . It leads to unrest . 
So it becomes climate change terrible . It &apos;s going to 
also happen to you , and it &apos;s the energy price for you . Very important . 
The fact is , if you &apos;re just talking about one thing , you could reduce the price , you &apos;d be reducing poverty . Energy in a very , by far the most effective way . 
Well , the energy price has fallen over time . 
In fact , the progress society is based on energy advances that drove 
coal evolution . The industrial revolution , and even the industrial revolution in the twentieth century , there was a rapid fall in the electricity price , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators . Air conditioning , we can make modern materials . And so many things do 
we do . We &apos;re in the same wonderful situation . With electricity in the rich world , 
but if we do the price down , we let ourselves be reduced by half . Meet the price . Come across a new barrier , and this barrier is related to CO2 . 
CO2 warms up the planet and the equation for CO2 is the actual amount of clarity . 
It &apos;s adding up the CO2 that &apos;s emitted . Which one is increasing temperature ? Which one is increasing temperature , and this increase in temperature has some very negative consequences . Effects on the weather . And maybe worse , indirect effect . That &apos;s that natural ecosystems are so rapidly changing that they don &apos;t adapt . Can and can , therefore , whole systems collapse ? Well 
, the exact relationship between a CO2 increase and the resulting CO2 change and where that change is going to be further consequences . Because there &apos;s some ambiguity . But not very many . 
And there are certainly ambiguities about that , how bad these consequences will be . But they will be extremely bad . 
I have the top scientists asked several times , &quot; Do we really have to get down to near zero ? 
&quot; Is it not enough ? The half or the quarter , 
the answer is , until we get near zero . Will the temperature keep going ? Will it rise ? 
That &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge . 
It &apos;s quite different . It &apos;s different than saying , &quot; We have a three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ foot truck . &quot; The one below a three @-@ foot bridge . &quot; You have to do that . &quot; You can sort of do it under it . &quot; You squeeze 
this one . &quot; This has to be completely down to zero . 
Well , we hit every year . One lot of carbon dioxide . A lot of over 26 billion tons of 
every American , about 20 tons . People from poor countries , less than one in average 
, are the average of about five tons . For each of them on the planet , 
and somehow we need to make changes . The ones that do that to zero , 
it &apos;s constant . It &apos;s gone 
up just different economic ones . Changes have made it even more influential . And we need to be affected by rapid increases to reduction . And then to reduce to a reduction to zero , 
this equation has . Four factors : A bit of multiplication . They have this thing on the left , CO2 . That they &apos;re heading towards zero . And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be done by the number of people . It &apos;s going to depend on the services that every human being uses on average . It &apos;s going to be the average energy for every service , and the CO2 emitted per unit of energy . 
Let &apos;s let &apos;s therefore take every factor individually . So look at and think about how we can do that to zero . 
Probably , there &apos;s one of these numbers that has to come very close to zero . 
Now , this is basic algebra . But go ahead and go through it . 
First of all , we have the population today . 
Six @-@ eight billion people , 
and it &apos;s going to reach nine billion . 
To the ones who are going to nine billion , if we &apos;re very successful in new vaccines , healthcare and healthcare and reproductive medicine , we could probably do that by 10 to 15 percent . But to date , we &apos;re seeing a climb of 1.3 percent of 
the second factor . Are the services that we use ? 
Are these services ? All of this includes the food that we eat ? Clothing , television , heating . 
These are very good things . And poverty reduction means these services almost to everyone on the planet . 
Accessible access to it is great . That these numbers are rising 
in the rich world , in the upper billion . Could we possibly cut off ? And less use , but on average , this number is going to rise every year . And it &apos;s going to increase overall by more than doubling the number of services per person provided . 
Here &apos;s where we see a very basic service . Is there a very basic service at home ? Is there light to do the homework ? Can 
and can these students have it ? So , they go out and read their homework . Underneath the street light , 
now , in effectiveness , the E , the energy per service gives . It finally good news . 
We have something that &apos;s not rising . 
Because of different successes in the lighting sector , through other types of cars , through new methods . In building houses , there are many services whose energy use they dramatically reduce . Can drastically reduce ? Will it be ? 103 : 00 . 
05 : 50 . 000 . GT . 00 : 05 : 53 : 000 . Some services leave themselves around 90 % reduced . 
Some individual services leave themselves around the 90 % cut . In others , such as manufacturing , the fertilisers 105 : 00 05 . 56 : 000 GT : 00 05 58 . 
000 or DEM : Air transport Or Air transport Is the margin for improvement ? Very much smaller . Total if we are optimistic , we will perhaps get a reduction . To achieve one factor 3 , or maybe even one factor , six . 
But for the first three factors , the first three are now 26 billion to maybe the very best . 13 billion tons went . And that &apos;s just enough . Not enough . 
Let &apos;s look at the fourth factor . So , and this one becomes a key factor . That &apos;s the amount of CO2 that we have . That &apos;s the amount of CO2 emitted per unit of energy , it &apos;s the amount . 
It &apos;s the question of whether you can do that to zero . 
If you have coal burning , no , 
if you burn natural gas , no . 
Almost every method of producing electricity . It emits CO2 today , except renewable energy , nuclear energy , 
so what we do on a global scale . Do we have to do is create a new system ? 
We need energy under when 
I &apos;m going to use the term &quot; miracle . &quot; My term is not the impossible , 
the microprocessor . Is it a miracle ? The PC is a miracle . 
That Internet and its services are wonderful . 
The computer is a miracle . People here have . 
The fact that you can do a miracle up to a certain date . 
Normally , you &apos;re just standing next to it . And some people come not . In 
this case , we have to do full gas . And a miracle in very short order of time . Get 
now , I wondered , how can I do that really ? 
Is there a natural illustration , a demonstration ? The ones that illustrate the idea of the people here ? &quot; 
I remembered last year . When I was bringing mosquitos , and I kind of liked that , 
people liked that idea . For them , really tangible . You know , people are there . The ones with mosquitos live 
for energy fell . I did this , I decided , 
I decided that releasing mosquitoes of fireflies this year &apos;s contribution to the environment here . Would this be here 
? So , here are some natural fireflies . 
You have me been assured that they &apos;re not biting . Actually , they &apos;re probably not even going to leave the glass . 
Now , there are all kinds of game solutions like this , but they &apos;re not all very much of us . Do 
we need solutions ? Either one or more that require unimaginable scale . And unimaginable reliability has , and though it has many directions , in which people are looking for it . I really just see five of them looking for these big challenges . Can 
I ? I have tides . Geothermal fusion . And biofuels omitted . 
These are perhaps doing a moderate contribution , and if they do better than I expect them to do , that would be great . But my key message here is that we &apos;re working on all those five . And we can &apos;t do any of them . Because they give us some intimidation , because everybody has significant problems . 
Look at them first . We &apos;re going to burn fossil fuels . Fuel is burning . From either coal or natural gas , 
what you &apos;re going to have to do there seems to be . Maybe just . But that &apos;s it . Not you &apos;d have to take all that CO2 . That after the combustion from the combustion chimney comes in . Underneath pressure , liquefy and then somewhere else . And hope that it &apos;s there . 
It &apos;s got some pilot projects that do that on a 60 / 80 level . But it &apos;s 100 to get it . Will it be very difficult ? And it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get an agreement on the storage of CO2 . But that &apos;s the biggest problem here , the question of storage time . 
Who &apos;s going to get it ? 
Ensure . Who can make sure something is guaranteed ? What literally many billions of times larger ? As any kind of waste that you &apos;re dealing with from nuclear and other things , imagine . Can that be ? 
That &apos;s a lot of volume . 
So that &apos;s a hard nut . When I 
next came up with nuclear energy , 
it also has three big ones . Problems that cost you , especially in highly regulated countries , are high . The question of safety is that you really feel that nothing is wrong . Can you , despite human cooperation , that the fuel is not for weapons , 
can you ? And what does you do ? With the waste , 
because although it &apos;s not very big , it &apos;s not very big . Is there a lot of concern ? The 
people have to worry about it well . 
184 : 00 10 20 000 GT 00 10 25 000 GT , which is three very difficult ones . Problems that might be solvable , so three very difficult problems , The ones that may be solvable and where you can work , and that &apos;s why you should . 
The last three of the five have been summarized by me . 
They &apos;re renewable energy . Like you often call them , 
and they &apos;re also those that , although it &apos;s great . That they don &apos;t need fuel . They have some disadvantages . So 
one is that energy density is the energy density that these technologies generate . It &apos;s dramatically lower than that of power plants , 
and these are low @-@ energy energy — you talk about many square kilometers , thousands of times . More space than one normal power plant . And 
also , these sources are interruptions . 
The sun shines not the whole thing all day , it shines not every day , and just as blows blows the wind . Not constantly . So , you 
have to , if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , have a way to have the energy , even in times when it &apos;s not available . 
So getting it , there &apos;s a lot of price challenges here , there &apos;s challenges in transmission , for example , when we say that the energy source is outside the country . Do you not need it ? Only the technology . You need to have it at risk . You need to have the energy from where it 
comes from , and there &apos;s the storage problem 
and the dimension . To show you , I &apos;ve all sorts of batteries that I &apos;ve got to make . I &apos;ve looked at those for cars , computers . Mobile phones , flashlights for everything . And that &apos;s what I &apos;ve got with the amount of electronic energy that the world uses compared to what I found . I &apos;ve found out that all the batteries that we &apos;re now producing . Less than 10 minutes of total energy storage 
could we need . We need a big , big breakthrough here . Something that , to be a factor 100 , will be better . As the approaches to the moment , 
that &apos;s not impossible . But it &apos;s not that easy . 
That &apos;s what happens when you try to try and tell these interrupted sources about , say , 20 @-@ 30 percent of consumption . 
When you get around 100 percent of that , you need 100 percent of the amazing wonder battery . 
Now , where are we going to go ? What is the right approach ? 
A Manhattan project like , &quot; How do we get to the finish ? 
&quot; What we need is a lot of companies that are working on it , hundreds 
in each of these five areas . We need at least 100 people , 
many of whom will say , &quot; They &apos;re crazy . &quot; That &apos;s good . 
I think here in the TED , I think there are lots of people who are already engaged in this . 
Bill Gross has several companies under the TED group , including one called Esolar , which has great solar thermal technologies . 
Vinod Khosla is investing . In dozens of companies , doing great things and interesting opportunities , there are many companies that are doing this . And I &apos;m trying to support this . 
Nathan Myhrvold and I are funding a company . The maybe surprisingly , the nuclear approach is to follow , 
there are some innovations in the nuclear field modular . Liquid , the development 
has been very fluid in this industry some time ago . So , it &apos;s not a big surprise . It &apos;s a surprise that some good concepts lie around , the Terrapower concept means . 
It means you &apos;re going to replace a part of the uranium , the one percent , the U235 . We decided to burn the 99 . That &apos;s the U238 . That 
&apos;s a pretty crazy one . 
Idea , but actually , you had about it for a long time . But you could never make sense to simulate it . Whether it works would work , but since it became modern supercomputers , you can simulate it . And look at it , yes , with the right approach to matter , it looks like this . That it works 
and because you do these 99 burn is because it &apos;s a cost profile much better . In fact , 
you burn the garbage , and you can even burn the garbage from today &apos;s reactors as 
a drive . Instead of getting over the head , breaking your head , you just burn it . A great thing , 
uranium is going to be gradual . It consumes a little bit like a candle . 
It &apos;s going to be a kind of column . It &apos;s often a migratory wave called a 
reactor , which really solves the fuel problem . 
Here &apos;s a picture of a place in Kentucky . 
That &apos;s the waste . That &apos;s the 99 , you have the part that &apos;s burned today . Is taken out , so it &apos;s called &quot; depleted uranium . 
&quot; That drives the U.U. &apos; s for hundreds of years to come . 
And if you want to buy ocean water cheaply and simply filtrate , you get enough fuel for the rest . Life of the planet 
, you know , there &apos;s still a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example . From many hundreds of concepts that have been designed to be needed . 
To move forward , think about how to move forward , think 
about measuring our success . Should we , how should our testimony look ? 
Well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to achieve . And then talk about the goal , 
the intermediate step . A lot of people talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 . 
It &apos;s really , really important . That we get there , 
the rest of the 20 percent will be produced in poor countries . Are they going to , and are they still , agriculture ? Hopefully , forest threats and cement will be done by then . Clean . 
So , to make this 80 percent happen . Do you need developed countries , including countries like China , to completely redesign their generation of electricity 
? The other note says whether we &apos;re going to change zero emissions technology , whether they &apos;re going to be used in all developed countries . And we &apos;re going along the way , they &apos;re going to the rest . We &apos;re going to get 
that . That &apos;s great . Important . 
That &apos;s going to be a key element of this stuff . If we 
&apos;re going back from there , how should that be 2020 testimony ? 
It should be back to the two elements . 
We should be back to using the effectiveness measures to get reduction down the road . The less we emit , the less we emit , the lower the amount of CO2 . And so , too , the temperature , 
but actually , this note is for the things we do , the things that we don &apos;t do completely , the big reductions . Only the same , right ? Even something . Less important . How the other ? Which ones , the speed ? The innovation ? For these breakthroughs ? 
Represents this breakthroughs . Do we have to track with full gas ? And that can be measured . In company numbers , in pilot projects and regulatory changes , there are lots of great books . 
There are lots of great books on this subject 
, Al Gore &apos;s book . We have the choice , and David McKay &apos;s Sustainable . Energy without the Hot Air . You 
go there . You go through and create a framework . In that this is widely discussed . Because it &apos;s what we need to support . From all sides , 
there &apos;s a lot that comes together . 
Does that have to be a wish ? 
It &apos;s a very concrete one . It &apos;s a desire that we invent this technology 
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , if you will . I could , I could choose the president , a vaccine , and I love that . Or I could choose that wish , right ? The one is halved energy price . Without CO2 , it &apos;s invented . It &apos;s a desire I would take . 
This one has the greatest impact 
if we didn &apos;t get that wish . Will the ditch between the long term and the short term be thinking ? People terrible will be between the United States and China . Between poor and rich countries and rich countries , and almost all of them live on these two . Billions will be a lot worse . 
What do we need to do ? So 
what measures do I appeal for ? 
We need to work for more research funding . 
If countries are to be in places like Koppenhagen , they should not only be meeting on CO2 . 
They should be talking about this innovation strategy . And they would be shocked . They would be shocked by the ridiculously low money that is being spent on these innovative approaches . 
We need market incentives , carbon taxes . CAP &amp; amp ; Trade : Something that sends a price signal . 
We need to spread the news . 
We need dialogue , more rational and complete . And we also need to do the things that the government is doing 
, and it &apos;s an important wish , but I think we can fulfill it . 
Thank you very much . 
Thank you very much . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . Thank you . 
Thank you . Thank you very much . Just to make Terrapower a little better . To understand , first of all , you can give us an idea of the scale of this investment . 
Bill Gates : To simulate the simulation on a supercomputer , all the big scientists . To get what we did , what we need is just some 10 million , and even a few million . If we want to use our materials in a Russian reactor , to make sure it &apos;s reasonable to work . Is it just in the &apos; 100s ? Millions of the difficult step is that 
we build . Of the first reactor , to add billions more , to find the regulations and the place that actually is building the first of them . 
Once the first one is finished , when it &apos;s running the way it promised . Then it &apos;s all very clear . Because the economy , the energy density , is so different . When it comes to nuclear energy , as we know it , 
CA : To understand that correctly . That means deep into the ground . Almost like a vertical . Pillar : Nuclear fuel . That used . Uran and then begins the process of it . Up there , working on . After down , 
BG : Exactly today , you have to always reconnect the reactor . So there &apos;s a lot of people and a lot of controls going wrong . Can this thing , where you can open it ? And things in there . Or bring out ? That &apos;s not good . 
If you do , however , very cheap fuel , you can use it for 60 years , think . You can think of a column that you bury . Without that , all the complexities , 
and it sits there and burns . 60 years , and then it &apos;s -- it &apos;s done . 
CA : A nuclear reactor . The self , a solution for the garbage , 
BG : Yeah , well , what about the garbage ? You can do it . Let it sit there . There &apos;s much less garbage . With this method , then take it , and grab it and grab it . In the next reactor and burn it , continue . 
And we start by starting by putting the garbage . The one that already exists , which exists in these refrigerators or dry tanks , at the reactors . That &apos;s our starting fuel . So it &apos;s 
what kind of this reactors are a problem with . That &apos;s what we &apos;re doing in our fill , and that &apos;s dramatically reducing the volume of garbage . Reduces while this process is going on , about , 
but as they &apos;re working with different people in the world on these possibilities . Have 
where is that biggest ? Interest , such a thing . Realization . 
BG : Well , we still have not focused on one place . And it &apos;s there , there &apos;s a lot of interesting . Disclosure rules for everything that &apos;s nuclear in the name . There &apos;s a lot of interest , and the people of the company were in Russia , India . China , I was here and I have the Energy Minister . And that &apos;s how this led to the energy agenda . 
I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the French and the Japanese have something in their direction . 
This is a variant . One thing that was done . 
Was this ? This is an important step . Forward , but it &apos;s like a quick one . Reactor and some countries have these , built them , so everybody who &apos;s building a fast reactor is . Has a candidature for our first first CA in their 
imagination ? Timeframe . And probability , this is really something . Into life , to start . 
BG : Well , we need one of these scalable . Power generating things that are very cheap . We have 20 years to invent . And then 20 years to deploy . 
That &apos;s kind of the deadline , which is the environmental models have shown us . The ones we have to keep to , 
and you know , Terrapower , if everything goes well . And that &apos;s a big wish , you know . Could that be 
easy ? And fortunately , there are dozens of people today , and we need hundreds , who need hundreds , just as if their approaches work . The promotion of their pilots works . For that , they can offer , 
and it would be best if several could do it , because then you could use a mix , definitely you need . 
We need a solution . 
CA : Concerning the big , possible breakthroughs , this is the biggest one . This is what you know . 
BG : An energy break is the most important one . 
This would be it . Without that environmental challenge . But the power is still there . This much more important 
in the nuclear sector . Is there any other innovative companies 
? You know , we know their work not so well as this ? But it &apos;s the modular method that we have , and this is a different approach . 
It &apos;s a liquid reactor type , which is a little bit difficult . But maybe you &apos;re saying that about us 
and so there &apos;s a variety of , but the beauty of it is that a uranium molecule , a million times as much energy . How a say , let &apos;s say , a carbon molecule , and that &apos;s why , if you can deal with the problems , and they &apos;re mainly radiation . The footprint and the cost is playing this . Potential , so the impact on the country . And others , almost . In a separate league , CA 
: If that doesn &apos;t work , what ? 
Then we have to take emergency action . To do this , try to stabilize the Earth &apos;s temperature . 
BG : If you &apos;re in this situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;re eating too much . And for a moment before a heart attack , what do you do ? You need , maybe , a heart surgery or something like that . 
It &apos;s got a research that &apos;s going on called geoengineering . It &apos;s going to be looking at different techniques to make warming delayed . So that we can 20 or 30 years longer to get ourselves together 
, which is just one insurance method . 
You hope that we can &apos;t do that . 
Some people say you should even say you shouldn &apos;t get to insurance first . Because you can maybe be lazy because you &apos;re not . So you can keep eating , because you know you &apos;re being run by heart surgery . 
I know not whether that &apos;s smart . If you look at the importance of this problem , you can look at it , but there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering . That &apos;s whether you can do that , right ? Should it be , if things get faster ? Or this innovation ? Longer it takes than we expect , 
about climate skeptics , do you have one or two sentences for those around you , perhaps to convince you ? 
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps . 
Those who have scientific arguments are those who do very little . 
Say , they say it has negative effects . The ones with the clouds to do with have things moving , right ? 
It &apos;s very , very few things that you can even say . There are very few of them that have a chance in a million , 
the main problem here is so similar . Like with AIDS , 
you do the mistake . Now and you pay for it very much . Later 
and therefore , the idea is now , if you all kinds of urgent problems are present . In something to invest , from what you &apos;re only going to have later , and then you get to that . That the investment is not so clear that it &apos;s going to be . In fact , the IPCC Report is not necessarily the worst scenario . And it &apos;s people in the world of rich . The people who look at IPCC and say , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s not a big one . &quot; Drama , 
the fact is that these uncertainty gives us cause for concern . Should we , 
though , have my dream here ? Is that if you can make it economically and at the same time eliminate CO2 . Then you also say , skeptics say , okay . It &apos;s interesting to me . It &apos;s not that it emits CO2 . I almost wish it emits it , but I &apos;m going to accept it . Because it &apos;s cheaper . It &apos;s cheaper than the previous 
method , CA , and that would be your answer to Björn . Lomborg argument that if you put all of this time and energy into use to reduce CO2 problem , if you use it , you can do it . All of the other goals suffer from it : Poverty reduction , poverty reduction , malaria control , and so on . That it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources , right ? Money for it to be invested while it &apos;s better . The things we can do , 
BG : Well , the actual spending on research . We , the U.S. , should be spending 10 billion more a year . As they spend today , that &apos;s not the dramatic thing . 
It should be other things that should not suffer . 
You come along to big amounts of money . And here you can have reasonable people contradicting . If you do have something that &apos;s not economically sound and tries to do that . For me , this is where most waste happens . It &apos;s 
unless you &apos;re very , very short . Before you break through costs and only fund the learning curve , I think we should do more things . The ones that have the potential , very much cheaper . 
To be in case the swab hits you get is a very high energy price . Then you can only get the rich to keep up . 
I mean , each of us here could have five times as much for our energy , spend . Without his lifestyle , changing for 
the sake of the bottom two billion , 
but is it a disaster ? And even Lomborg thinks about 
his own new mesh , is now why is the research going to stop being discussed ? He 
&apos;s always going to be discussed because of his earlier stories with the skeptic camp . But he has understood that this is one very lonely group of people . And that &apos;s why he &apos;s now bringing the research argument , 
and that &apos;s a thought . It &apos;s something I think is appropriate : 
Research . It &apos;s just crazy . How little the people support it ? CA 
: Bill , I think I &apos;m speaking for almost all the people here . If I say I hope really , really , that your wish will come true . Thank you very much . 
BG : Thank you . 
I would like to give you a little bit of a talk . What I was told a few months ago when I wrote an article for Italian . Wired noticed was , &quot; 
I was writing always my synonym dictionary ready for use . But I was with the editing of the text . Already finished and I fell on the fact that I &apos;ve never been in my life looking after it . What that word hinders really means , I 
read you the word entry , 
disabled . Adjective : Curved , helpless , useless . Destroyed . Deceased . Mutilated . Wounded . Mastered . Hum . Separated . Keep it away . Determined . Weakened . @ impotent . Castrated . @ paralyzed . @ walking andicapt. @ senil @ age @-@ weak . @ From the market @ pulled @ improved @ done @ broken @ borrowed @ counted ( See also injured ) @ useless And @ weak @ 
antonyme , @ healthy , @ strong @ efficient I have 
these lists on my hands , read out to a friend . And I had to laugh first . It worked like this ridiculous . But I came only until I was prepared and couldn &apos;t do any more , and I had to stop . I had to read and collect . I had to do this after this invincible flood of words and the 
emotional shock that it caused , of course . That was a frayed old synonym dictionary . I just thought , I thought the issue was pretty old , it had 
to be . But actually , it was an issue on the early &apos; 80s . When I was just talking to primary school , and I started doing that , my self @-@ image . Outside of my family environment , and building and shaping it . Also in terms of other kids , and in terms of the rest of the world around me . 
And God be thankfully . Have I got no synonymous dictionary at that time ? Would 
I use this entry seriously ? Take it seriously . Would I be born into a world ? The one like me , as a person , would perceive it as a person whose life in no way goes positive . Can today , however , I become a person for the opportunities and adventures I &apos;ve experienced ? Famous , 
so I &apos;ve immediately celebrated the online edition of 2009 , which I started to call myself . And I expect that I &apos;m going to make a more appealing contribution here . 
Here &apos;s the updated version of this entry . 
Unfortunately , it &apos;s not much . Better , especially , 
I &apos;m shocked by the last two words . Among &quot; Near Anonyms , whole and healthy , &quot; 
but it &apos;s not just about the words , 
it &apos;s about what we &apos;re talking about people . The ones we think about with these words , 
it &apos;s about values . The ones in these words are , and how we put those values into 
shape , affects our language . Our thinking and how we put the world and the people into the world around us . 
A lot of ancient societies , including Greeks and Greeks and Romans , have . Really believed . That the debate on a curse is a great force . Because that &apos;s what you say loud , also manifests itself , can manifest itself . 
So what do we want ? Actually , manifest . You want to have a disabled person . People or you want a powerful person . People alone , 
already a human being . Careless , as a child . Could be enough to limit them ? And to give them ideas . Would it 
not be more beautiful to do them ? Doors to open . A human being . The 
one for me , who opened doors was my pediatrician . AM : A.I.I. DuPont Institute in the Wilmington Institute in Delaware , 
called Dr. Pizzutillo , a Italo @-@ American whose name is like you think . Can the majority of Americans not be correct ? Vote could say , so he was always Dr. P. 
And Dr. P. wore always very much colorful . Flies and was for the work , with children . Simply like made . 
I found the time , which I found in this hospital , I spent . Simply great . Until the time 
I was physiotherapy , I had to do some exercises , seemingly infinitely . With these thick , elastic bands in different colors , you know , around my leg muscles , you know . And I have these bands more than hated . When everything else , I have them hated , I have them cursed . I have them hated . 
And imagine if you can , I have even already been as a kid of five with Dr. P. negotiated . And so this is how these exercises try to stop . Natural , without success . 
And one day , he has me at a one of my exercises . These exercises were simple , tiring . And mercilessly and he said to him , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful . And young girl , you &apos;re going to be one of those tapes one 
day , tearing it apart , and if you can do it , I &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot; 
That was , of course , just a simple trick . Of Dr. P. , to get me to do the exercises that I don &apos;t do . Want to do the prospect that the richest five @-@ year @-@ old girl in the hospital on the second floor ? But he has me actually to do that , actually , to bring my daily exercise horror to new eyes . So this has turned into a new and promising experience . 
And I ask myself today how I feel about his vision of me . When I &apos;m strong and powerful , young girl , my self @-@ image has shaped and I could imagine myself as a young girl who was inherently strong , powerful and atlethic . To see this is just 
one thing , just an example . From many , like adults in power positions . The imagination of a child can inspire , 
but how that can inspire , as the examples from the synonymous dictionaries that have already been cited , our language doesn &apos;t give us any room to imagine something . What we &apos;re all hoping for would be for each and every one of us to be able to do . To make ourselves powerful people , to see 
our language lags behind . To make social changes . The changes that are often caused by technological change in many cases have 
been medically driven from a medical point of view . You can , of course , say that my legs , laser surgery for visually impaired , knee joints made of titanium and artificial hip joints . For aging bodies , which make it possible for people to really all their possibilities . And to get to the limits , the limits , the natural destiny that they face . Has gone beyond developing . Even not to speak . Not to talk about social networking platforms , people are allowing themselves to give their own identity . Give themselves to their own way . Define and 
self @-@ define worldwide , thereby becoming groups @-@ oriented . The ones 
they self @-@ choose , perhaps , so this technological change is a clear illustration . Clearer than ever , that it &apos;s always been another truth , that is , that everyone has always been a human being , something very special and very powerful in society . Can and can and can be human ability to adapt , our greatest plus ? The human ability to adapt , 
the human ability to adapt , is an interesting story . Because people tell me time and again about asking me to tell . How I do with adversity and how I will treat you , and I &apos;ll confess something , this sentence has . For me , never fit , and I never did , and I &apos;ve always been very uncomfortable . So I felt the questions of people about how to answer them . And I think , gradually , I understand why . 
This sentence from dealing with adversity is : Lives on the idea that success is , or happiness depends on it . A challenge to master . Without being challenged by the experience that it entails . As if my life is so successful , my life is because I have to recognize the possible traps of a life with a prosthesis . Could or how could , however , people , with my disability , 
perceive me ? But the truth is that we have to change , of course . We are from the challenge , no matter whether it &apos;s physical , emotional or even both . 
And I claim that this is good , right 
? Distress is not an obstacle . That we curve , to get in touch with our lives better , to get in touch with them . 
Distress is just part of it . Our lives 
and I tend to be adversity as my shadow . 
Too to see , sometimes I realize that it &apos;s very present . Sometimes it &apos;s hardly too visible . 
But it &apos;s constantly at my side . And I want to make absolutely no sense of the impact or severity of the fight of a human being . 
It &apos;s in life adversity and adversity and challenges , and they &apos;re all too common . Real and every person goes with it . Different about it , but the question is not whether we can deal with adversity clearly or not . It &apos;s how we can deal with it . So we &apos;re not just responsible for it . 
The people who we love before we hit fate are protected from . They are also responsible for preparing them for it . Good for it . Clear for it . Too close 
and we &apos;re showing our children . Not a favor if we give them the feeling that they &apos;re feeling they &apos;re not adapting . 
Can you have to do two things : Separate them ? So one is medical fact amputates the fact that they &apos;re amputee , and the other is social opinion about whether I &apos;m disabled . 
Or not . And to be honest , the truth is , the only real and permanent disability that I have to deal with . Was it necessary that the world should constantly mean ? It can tell me with these definitions . 
In our desire to make people understand how to protect the people that care about us . And to give them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis . Or even a prognosis about quality of life . To make the ones that they expect , we have to be careful not to lay the foundation for someone actually to obstruct , or to make sure that they are disabled . 
Maybe it &apos;s the current concept . That &apos;s just a look at what &apos;s broken in a broken . And how we do that , repair it for each individual , greater disability than pathology , for each one of us . 
At its very nature , if we don &apos;t treat a person holistically and not all of his forces . And possibilities , and opportunities , perceive and recognize . Create . In addition to the natural struggle . Create the one you may need to lead , another disease . 
We degrade . A human being who is responsible for our society , 
that is , we need to know about patology beyond patology . And we need to look at all areas of human potential , 
most importantly , but most importantly , it &apos;s that it &apos;s between percepting our shortcomings and our great inventive spirit . 
We should connect these challenging times . Not devalue . Or deny . We should not try to try to avoid them . We should not try to devalue them under the carpet . We should not sweep them under the carpet . It &apos;s about opportunities in adversity . 
It &apos;s about recognizing it . It &apos;s perhaps more about making it clear to me . It &apos;s about not necessarily overcoming adversity . It &apos;s about making it open to us . It &apos;s about embracing it . It &apos;s about embracing it . It &apos;s about packing it in the head . And maybe even dancing with it . 
And maybe we can do it . It &apos;s about adversity as something natural , coherent and useful to see . And feeling us like this . Your presence , not . More like that , burdened . In 
this year , we celebrate the 200th . Birthday of Charles . Darwin and as he was 150 years ago about evolution written about evolution , Darwin , in my eyes , has something very true in human beings , in human nature . 
It &apos;s worth pointing out , I would rewrite it that way , not the strongest of its kind survives . And also , not . The smartest of its kind , but the one of the changes that best adapt to it . 
Can you get out of conflict ? Creativity , not . Only 
from Darwin &apos;s work do we know that the ability of man to survive and survive and flourish from the struggle of the human mind . Determined is the struggle of conflict to change . 
So again , change and adaptation are the greatest abilities . Of man 
and maybe we know about it only from which wood we carved , and we know what wood we are carved from . If we really checked , 
maybe we &apos;re just checking that , that &apos;s the point . Of adversity , of perception . Of ego , of feeling for our own strength . 
We can feel like that ourselves . 
We can give adversity a new meaning , The ones about difficult times go beyond , 
maybe we can give adversity as change . 
Adversity stands for an impasse . At the one we &apos;re not yet adapted to , 
I think , the greatest damage , the greatest damage we have done to ourselves . Have it is to believe . 
That we are normal to be . Let &apos;s be honest . Who is normal ? 
It &apos;s not normal . 
It &apos;s normal to be typical to be typical , but not normal , and would you like to be this poor , gray person ? Really ? Do you want to know if it really existed ? 
I think more of a thing , it wouldn &apos;t be great . 
If we were to learn this pattern of normality against another of the possibilities or the strength . To do it , even a little more dangerous , exchange ideas could be done . So this is how we can exchange the forces of very many children . And they can invite them to release their very special and valuable abilities into society , to bring them into society . 
Anthropolgen has found out . That we humans from the members of our society always have one thing to ask for . Useful to be . And one contribution to make , 
it &apos;s hints at the fact that even Neanderthals , before 60 000 years ago , older people and people with severe physical injuries , with worn with . And that &apos;s perhaps because the reason life experience in the struggle for survival of these people is valuable to society . It &apos;s because 
they don &apos;t have broken these people and they &apos;re useless . They see them as something special . And valuable ones are treated 
a few years ago . Was I going to the city ? Was it where I grew up , I went to a food market in that Red Zone . IM : Northeast of Pennsylvania and I stood there in front of a bushel . Tomatoes . 
ES was summer and I had a shorts on and 
I had shorts , and I hear a guy behind me . Says , &quot; Well , if that &apos;s not Aimee Mullins 
and I turn around and I see this older man , I had no idea what . Who he is 
and I meant , &quot; Excuse me . Sir , do we know ? I can &apos;t get to you . &quot; And 
he said , &quot; Well , you should hardly remember . I remember when 
I saw you when I first saw you . &quot; &quot; Did I get you out ? &quot; &quot; The belly of your mother . &quot; 
&quot; Get you , oh . 
&quot; So , the , and of course , it &apos;s done , but click . 
That was Dr. Kean , a man . The guy I just made from stories by my mother about this day . Because I knew about this day , of course , very typical of my birthday , two weeks late . I came to the doctor for 
prenatal diagnostics of my mother , and I was on vacation . And so we knew my parents knew the man who made me born . Anyway , not at all . 
And because I was without a calf &apos;s legs and my feet were born after them , right ? Had and I only had a few toes . At this and one pair of toes at the other foot , was he the handler , the stranger had to have the bad news . 
He said to me , &quot; I had to tell your parents . That you never walk . And never would be so mobile . &quot; His would be like other kids or that you never would be an independent life . Could and ever since , they &apos;ve just lied to me . Punished , really 
? Exceptional , I found that he had newspaper clips of my entire childhood . No matter whether I was competing for a letter in second grade , whether I had won . Whether I was competing with the scout scouts at the Halloween Parade on Halloween , whether I was traveling my scholarship or a scholarship or one of my sporting victories . And he used these clips to make his students go to teach . Medical students from the Hahnemann Medical School and the Hershey Medical School , 
and he called it this part of his course . The X factor , the potential . The human will . 
You can just not do enough to emphasize how crucial this factor is . For the quality of life of a human being , 
and Dr. Kean continued . He said , &quot; I learned that children , if they don &apos;t always do something else , and they do , even if they just do a little bit of support . If you have kids , you leave them to themselves , children can do a lot . Look 
, Dr. Kean . Has his thinking changed 
? He had understood . That the medical diagnosis and how the person with it handles 
two different things is two different things . And also , I have my thinking in the course of time changed . If you want to change me at the age of 15 , would you have asked me if I could have my prostheses against legs of meat and bone ? Would that have meant I wouldn &apos;t have hesitated for a second ? 
I wanted to do it normally at that time . 
If you would have me ask that today , I &apos;m not so sure . 
And that &apos;s what happened . Because I have something to do with my legs . And not despite these experiences and experiences , and maybe this change could 
happen . Because I was so many people I met . Am the ones that opened my doors ? Have instead of people meeting ? The ones that restrict me or give me an idea , 
see , you see , it needs . Really ? Only one person who wants to demonstrate to you how you can manifest your forces . And you &apos;re through when 
you &apos;re through somebody &apos;s ability to make their own inner forces activated . The human mind is like this receptive . If you do that and for you to be in a critical moment , a door open . Then you &apos;re for those people . Very , very good teachers . 
You bring them to bear on yourself doors to open . 
The real meaning of the word educate is rooted in the word educe , which 
means something to produce . The fact that in one is the potential to tickle out . Again 
, what potential do we want , then , to retrieve ? 
In the &apos; 60s , in the United Kingdom , a case study was conducted . Back then , high schools were 
transformed into schools . They call this there . Streaming Trials in the United States call 
it &quot; streaming trials . &quot; We call this tracking . The students are divided into grades 
and the A students get heavier orally . Get the better teachers , etc . 
They have over a few months to go . Students with a sufficient number of grade very good given . It was given to them that they were aces . That they were very smart . And after these three months , they got really one letter . 
And of course , it breaks one &apos;s heart . To hear that the other way around , the one @-@ serer students were told . They were just enough . And 
the same was the case after the three months . And yet only 
those who always were still in the school , still . Apart from the students who were the school @-@ 
makers , quite crucial . With this study , it was that teachers were not inaugurated . 
The teachers knew not that something was changed . 
They were just told that they were the Einser students and that they were the students with the grade enough and the same thing . They gave them some lessons and they 
treated them as the only real disability . Is it a broken mind ? Is it a spirit that was broken ? Has it not been hoped ? More he finds nothing . More beautiful . He lacks our natural , childish . Curiosity . And our innate ability to imagination , 
when we do , but we can do it , the human mind to help with it . And then hoping to self @-@ hope and other people to get around . Beautiful to find . Curious and imaginative to be then then put us on our forces . 
Really ? Positive : If a mind is about these qualities , it can be a new reality , and new forms of existence . 
I want to talk to you about a poem . That of a Persian poet called Poet Hafiz in the 14th century , written . Was and written by the one that my friend Jacques Dembois tells me ? And that poem is called &quot; The God Who Only Words Four Words . &quot; Every child knows God , not the God . The name , not . The God Who Forbidden , but the God . The God Who Words Only Four Words , and repeats them all the time , he says , &quot; Only 
come dance . &quot; With me , come dance . With me , thank you very much . .
