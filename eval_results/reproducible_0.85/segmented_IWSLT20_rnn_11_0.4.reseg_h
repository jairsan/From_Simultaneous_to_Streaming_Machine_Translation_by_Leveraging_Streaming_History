A few years ago here at TED , Peter Skillman launched a design competition called &quot; The Marshmallow Challenge . 
&quot; The idea is pretty simple . Four teams have to have the widest possible freestanding structure with 20 spaghetti , about 1m tape , about 1m thread . And build a marshmallow , 
the marshmallow has to get up on top . 
And though it really seems simple , it &apos;s actually true . Hard , because it &apos;s pushing people to work together very quickly . 
And so I thought this was an interesting idea . And I put it into a design workshop . 
It was a huge success . 
Since then , I &apos;ve been doing about 70 workshops around the world . With students , developers and architects , even CTOs , the Fortune 50 companies , and there &apos;s something about this task . What deep impressions into nature . It allows cooperation , and I want to share some of these with you . 
Normally , most people start themselves . Regarding the task of orienting , 
they talk about it , they think about what it looks like . Will it hang around power , 
then they invest in it ? A little time . Planning and organization , they sketch and put spaghetti out , 
they invest a lot of their time . In the assembling of constantly growing structures , 
and finally , just before they have no time anymore . Does anybody take the marshmallow ? And they gently put it . You get to the top , step one . Back and admire TA @-@ da . You admire your work . 
But then , what happens almost always is that TA @-@ da becomes an UH @-@ Oh . Because the weight of the marshmallow causes the whole thing to bend and collapse , 
there &apos;s a series of people who have a lot more UH @-@ Oh moments . As others , and among the worst , are freshest BWL graduates , 
they lie , they cheat . They &apos;re confused . And they really produce . Droughty entities . 
And of course , there are teams . The much more TA @-@ DA entities have , and are among the best . Fresh graduates of the kindergarten , 
and that &apos;s quite amazing . 
As Peter told us , they not only produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting ones . Structures of all , 
what you might ask . Is this how does it come ? Why ? What about those 
and Peter ? Does none of the kids tell us ? Is it time to invest in the head of Spaghetti GmbH ? 
They don &apos;t invest time . In power struggles 
, there &apos;s another reason , 
and that &apos;s because BWL students have been trained . One of the reasons to find a real plan 
. OK . And then to realize 
what happens . If you put the Marshmallow on top , you don &apos;t have time anymore , and what happens ? 
It &apos;s a crisis . 
Sounds familiar . What else 
do kindergarten kids do ? What they do is they start with the Marshmallow . And prototypes build successful prototypes . Always with the Marshmallow at the top . So they have the opportunity to have multiple repair of dilapidated prototypes . 
Constructors recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of an iterative process . 
And with every attempt , the kids get immediately . Feedback : What works ? And what doesn &apos;t . 
So the performance with prototypes is like this . Working essential , but let &apos;s see how different . Teams are 
acting the average , for most , is about 50 centimeters of BWL students . Half of them are doing . Lawyers do something about this . More , but not . A lot of kindergarten kids . Are better . Than adults . 
Who &apos;s most successful ? 
Architects and engineers . 
Fortunately , 1m is the highest I &apos;ve seen . 
And why ? Because you understand triangles . And self @-@ reinforcing geometric patterns . Are the keys ? To build stable structures , 
CEOs are slightly above average . But here it gets interesting . 
You put an executive administrator on the team , they get significantly better . 
It &apos;s incredible . You look around and you see this team . You 
can predict that . Why ? Is that possible ? 
Because you have special process monitoring skills . 
You run the process . You understand it , 
and that team that controls and pays attention to the work , the team &apos;s performance will significantly improve . 
Specialized skills and process skills and their combination will lead to success . 
If you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six , which have stable structures . 
So I tried something exciting . 
I thought , let &apos;s get the poker bet right away . 
So I offered a $ 10,000 prize . Software for the winners . 
What do you think happened ? With these design students , 
what was that ? 
Result : This didn &apos;t happen . A team had a stable structure . 
If anyone had a two @-@ inch construction , he would have won the prize home . 
So isn &apos;t it interesting ? That high betting has a strong effect ? 
We repeated this exercise with the same students . 
What do you think happened ? 
Well , you understood the advantage . The prototyping , 
it turned out to be the same bad team . One of the best ones , 
they made the highest construction in the least time . 
So there are profound lessons for us . About the nature of propulsion and success 
, you may ask . Why ? Would anyone actually invest time ? Creating a Marshmallow Challenge . 
The reason is , I help digital tools . And make processes to help teams . Cars , video games and visual . Create effects . 
And what the Marshmallow Challenge does is it helps you identify hidden assumptions . 
Because frankly , every project has its own Marshmallow , which is 
the challenge . A shared experience , a common language or basic attitude to build the right prototype . 
And this is the value of this experience . This simple exercise , 
and those of you who are interested in it , can be MarshmallowChallenge 
@ com. It &apos;s a blog where you can see . How to build the Marshmallows . 
There &apos;s a step @-@ by @-@ step guide there . 
You can find crazy examples . Around the world , like people optimize the system and 
refiner it , there are also world records , 
and I think the basal lesson is this . Is the construction ? In fact , a connecting sport . Is 
it required ? Is it that we all focus our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking optimally ? How our feelings and our actions challenge the challenge that lies ahead of us ? 
And sometimes a small prototype . This experience , everything it takes . We &apos;re from an UH @-@ Oh to a TA @-@ DA moment . Bring that , 
and that can make a big difference . 
Thank you . 
Let &apos;s pretend we have a machine here . 
A big machine . A cool TED @-@ like one . Machine , and that &apos;s a time machine . 
And everybody in this room has to go in , 
and you can go back to the past , you can go into the future . You can &apos;t go into the here 
and now . And I wonder what you &apos;re choosing . Would you , because I &apos;ve been hearing this question a lot about my friends recently , and they all wanted to go into the past ? 
I don &apos;t know they wanted to go back to time before cars were there . Or Twitter or America . Suck the superstar . 
I don &apos;t know . 
I &apos;m convinced that somehow you can feel nostalgia , wishful thinking . 
And I understand that . 
I &apos;m not part of this group . Do I have to say , &quot; 
I don &apos;t want to go back to the past , &quot; and that &apos;s not because I &apos;m an adventurer . 
It &apos;s because opportunities on this planet are not going back . They &apos;re going forward , 
so I want to go into this machine , and I want to go into the future . 
This is the greatest time . It &apos;s ever been on this planet , no matter what scale they &apos;re going to take . Health , wealth . Mobility , opportunities , declining . Disease rates . 
There &apos;s never been a time like this before when 
my great grandparents died . Everybody when they were 60 , 
my grandparents pushed this number to 70 , 
my parents . Are 80 ? On the heels . 
So there should be a nine at the beginning of my death . 
But it &apos;s not even about people . How do we ? Because this is a bigger thing . As 
a child who &apos;s born today in New Delhi can . Wait to live for so long . Like the richest man in the world 100 years ago , 
think . Think about it . This is an incredible fact . 
And why is this ? 
Skirts , smallpox has billions of people on the planet killed . 
They &apos;ve got the demographics of the Earth . In a way , they &apos;ve redesigned it in a way that no war has ever managed . 
They &apos;re gone . They &apos;ve disappeared . 
We &apos;ve defeated them . Puff 
in the rich world . Do diseases exist ? The millions of us , just a generation ago , who have threatened them . Hardly any 
diphtheria is rubbing polio . 
Does it know at all ? Anyone else ? 
What that is ? Vaccines . Modern medicine . Our ability to feed billions of people . These are successes . The scientific method , 
and in my view , the scientific method is things . Try it out , see if it works . It changes if it doesn &apos;t . One of the greatest achievements of humanity , 
that &apos;s the good news . 
Unfortunately , that &apos;s the good news . Because there are some other problems . And they &apos;ve been mentioned many times . 
And one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people in the world every day . 
Hungry to bed . Go up this number , and it rises very quickly . And that &apos;s embarrassing . 
And not just that . We have used our imagination to do that . We have used this world to 
thoroughly devastate : Drinking water , primal land , rainforests . Oil , gas , they disappear . And soon . And if we don &apos;t innovate out of this chaos , we also disappear the question . 
So is that what we can do ? I think it &apos;s clear , 
I think , that we produce food . Can the billions of people feed ? Will it be without the land they live on ? Rape . 
I think we can use energy to power this world . They don &apos;t destroy it at the same time . 
I really think so . And no . This is not wishful thinking . 
But this keeps me awake at night . One of the things that keeps me awake at night is we &apos;ve never seen so much need for scientific progress . How do we do it now ? Never before . 
And we &apos;ve never been able to do it reasonably . We used to use it as we can today . 
We &apos;re on the threshold of amazing , amazing events in many areas , and yet I really think we &apos;re hundreds of 300 years before the Enlightenment goes back . Would we have to find a time ? In which we &apos;ve been fighting progress where we &apos;ve been more vigorously pushing these things . More fronts than people are now , 
people are wrapping themselves in their faith , so narrow . You don &apos;t liberate them . 
Can &apos;t even be the truth . You liberate them and hear them . 
Everyone has a right . In fact , in their opinion , a right . In their opinion on progress , 
but you know what they don &apos;t have a right to do 
. They don &apos;t have a right to their own facts . You don &apos;t have a charge , 
and I took a while . To figure out that out 
about a decade ago , I published an article about vaccines for The New Yorker . A little article , 
and I was amazed at resistance . I was struck by resistance to what the most effective measure in healthcare ultimately was in history , in the history of humanity . 
Is it not me who knew what I was doing ? So if I was to do something , I was just doing what I was always doing . I wrote an article and I went on . 
And soon afterwards , I wrote an article about genetically modified . Food : The 
same thing . Only bigger . 
People were crazy . 
So I also have written an article about this , and I couldn &apos;t understand . Why ? People thought that was frankenfood . Why ? They believed molecules were on a certain molecule , rather than a random way of moving around , an attack on the territory of nature . 
But , you know , I &apos;m doing what I &apos;m doing . I wrote the article . I kept going . 
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist . 
We type , we type , we go , we eat . That &apos;s okay . 
But these articles worried me . And I couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually found . I found out . 
And that &apos;s because these fanatics who mad me . No fanatics at all . 
Were these prudent people ? Educated people , decent people , 
they were just like the people in this room . 
And that got me so confused . 
But then I thought , &quot; You know what ? Let &apos;s be honest . 
We &apos;re at a point . We &apos;re not at the same relationship to progress . As we used to 
talk . Intermediate . 
We talk ironically about it . &quot; With small quotes , &quot; That &apos;s why progress is okay . &quot; 
There are reasons for that . And I think we know what reasons that is . 
We have trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science . In itself , lost , and there &apos;s no reason why that shouldn &apos;t be like that . 
You can just name a few names . And people will understand 
Chernobyl . Bhopal , Challenger , Vioxx Weapons of Mass Destruction , the 2000 US presidential election , I mean , 
you know , you can choose your own list . 
There are questions and problems . With the people we thought they were always right , they were always right . So be skeptical . 
Ask questions , demand . You demand evidence . 
You take evidence . You take nothing but given . 
Go ahead , but now , if you get evidence , you have to accept that evidence . And that &apos;s not good for us . 
And I can do that for the reason . That we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear , as I &apos;ve never seen before . And hopefully never again , 
about 12 years ago . A story was published . A terrible story . The Autism epidemic with measles , mumps and rubbles , linked vaccine . 
Very scary . 
Haufenwise studies were done . To see if that was true , 
Haufenwise studies should be done . This is a serious matter . 
The data came in . 
The data came in . From the United States , from England , from Sweden , from Canada , and they were all the same . No correlation , no connection . No , no , it . 
It makes no difference . It makes no difference . Because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see . What we believe to see , what causes us to feel real . 
We don &apos;t believe in a bundle of documents . From a government agency that gives us data , and I understand that , I think we all do that . 
But you know what ? 
The result of that was catastrophic . 
Catastrophic because of that fact , the United States is one of the only countries in the world . In which the measles vaccine rate is falling , 
that &apos;s scandalous , and we should be ashamed . 
It &apos;s terrible . 
What happened ? That we could do that . 
Well , I understand that . That &apos;s what I do . 
Because did anybody here have measles ? 
Did a single person in the audience ? The person who sees people dying of measles 
doesn &apos;t happen very often . 
Is it happening in this country ? Not at all . But 160,000 times in the world . Last year , 
these are many deaths from measles . 20 per hour , 
but because this doesn &apos;t happen here . Is it possible to push it out ? And people like Jenny McCarthy can . Walk around . And messages of fear . And illiteracy of platforms like Oprah and Larry King preach live , 
and you can do that . Because they don &apos;t connect cause and correlation . 
They don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same . But almost never are the same , 
and that &apos;s something we learn . We need to do it very quickly . 
This guy was a hero of Jonas Salk . 
He liberated us from one of the worst scourges of humanity . Don &apos;t worry . 
Don &apos;t worry . No pain . Cheese . Puff Gone The 
guy in the middle , not so much . 
He &apos;s called Paul Offit . 
He &apos;s just got a couple of other people to develop a rotavirus vaccine . 
He can live the lives of 400 , 500,000 children a year in the developing world . Save 
pretty well . Not . 
Well , that &apos;s good . Apart from Paul walking around talking about vaccines and saying , &quot; How valuable they are . &quot; And that people just stop . 
Should they complain ? And that &apos;s what 
he says , actually , so Paul is a terrorist , so 
when Paul speaks at a public hearing , he can &apos;t do without armed guards . Tell him 
he gets calls . Home . Because people like to tell him . They know where his kids go to school 
and why ? Because Paul has made a vaccine . 
I don &apos;t need that . Tell me , but vaccines are essential . 
Take them away . Turn the diseases back . Terrible diseases . And that &apos;s what happens . 
We have just been measles and measles in this country , 
and that &apos;s getting worse . And pretty soon , kids will die of it again . Because this is just a question . The numbers , 
and they &apos;re not just going to die of measles . 
What about polio ? Let &apos;s take that . Why ? 
Not . A fellow militant . I was told a few weeks ago that I wrote to me saying , &quot; She thinks I &apos;m a little too shrill . 
Nobody has ever said that before . 
&quot; She wouldn &apos;t fight polio against her child . Absolutely not . 
Fine , 
why ? Because we don &apos;t have polio . And you know what ? 
We had in this country yesterday no polio . 
Today , I don &apos;t know . Maybe this morning somebody went up in Lagos . In an airplane , and he &apos;s just flying . Go ahead . Angeles . He &apos;s over Ohio at 
the moment . And in a few hours , he lands and rents . A car , and he comes to Long . Beach , and he &apos;s going to be one of these fantastic TED dinner . This evening , 
and he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s going to be infected with a crippling disease . And we also know that . Not because that &apos;s how the world works . 
Well , this is the planet . We do it not . It &apos;s as if it &apos;s not . 
We love it . We love to lie , we love it . 
Do you all have your vitamins this morning ? Take 
Echinacea . A little antioxidant , that &apos;s what it does . Just jump on the jumps . Does 
I help ? I know . You did that . Because half of Americans do that every day . 
They take that stuff . And they take alternative remedies . And it doesn &apos;t make any difference . How often we find that they &apos;re useless ? 
The data records that all the time . 
They evaporate their urine . They do more . Never before . 
That &apos;s okay . They like 28 billion dollars . They like to pay for dark urine . 
I agree with you completely . 
Dark urine : Dark . 
Why ? Let &apos;s do that . Why ? Let &apos;s do that . 
Well , I think we understand . Hate the pharmaceutical industry . 
We hate too strong a government . We don &apos;t have confidence . We have faith in the system , 
and we shouldn &apos;t . Our healthcare system is . Mies , 
it &apos;s cruel . Millions of people , 
it &apos;s absolutely amazing . It &apos;s cold and soul @-@ depressing , even . To us who can afford it , 
so we &apos;re walking away from it and where are we going . 
We &apos;re walking into the arms of the placebo industry . 
That &apos;s great . I love the placebo industry . 
But you know that ? Is really a serious matter . Because the stuff is crap . And we &apos;re giving billions of dollars for it . 
And I have all sorts of little props here , 
no . Of which Gingko was cheating . Echinacea was cheating . Acai : I don &apos;t know . Let &apos;s see what that is . But we &apos;re giving billions of dollars for it . It &apos;s cheating , 
and you know what ? When I say that , people scream at me . And they say , &quot; What &apos;s it that cares about ? &quot; &quot; Let people do it . &quot; &quot; What they 
want , &quot; they feel good . And 
you know what ? They &apos;re wrong . 
Because I don &apos;t care . Whether it &apos;s the Health Minister who says , &quot; Hmm , I &apos;m going to not take the evidence of my experts on mammography . &quot; Or any cancer quack salver who will treat his patients with coffee intakes if 
they go down that path . Where do I think and magic replace evidence and science , they get to a place where they don &apos;t want to be . 
They get to Thabo . Mbeki in South Africa : 
He brought 400,000 of his people around because he insisted that red beds , garlic and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs . We know they &apos;re going to be the ones that can slow down the course of AIDS . 
Hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country worse than any other country plagued by this disease . 
Will you please not tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences ? 
They have them , they always have them , 
now the most brain @-@ free epidemic . In which we are now in , this absurd battle between the advocates of genetically modified organisms is . Modified food and the organic elite , 
this is an idiotic one . Debate : It has to stop . 
It &apos;s a debate about words about metaphors , 
this is ideology . Not science . 
Everything we eat , every grain of rice , every branch of parsley , every sprouts . Has been changed by people ? 
You know , there were no mandarin . In paradise , 
there were no cantaloupe melons . There were no Christmas trees . We did all of that . 
We did it in the last 11,000 years . 
And some of it worked . And some of it didn &apos;t . 
We got rid of it . What didn &apos;t ? It worked . 
Now we can make it more accurate . And of course , there are risks . But we can do something like vitamin A in rice . And the stuff can help millions of people . Millions of people , their lives . 
Prolonging that . That &apos;s what they want . Don &apos;t do it . 
I have to say , I understand that . Not 
we reject genetically . Modified food . 
Why ? Let &apos;s do that . 
Well , what I hear all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides . Hormones . Mono @-@ culture . We don &apos;t want huge fields . One thing : That &apos;s wrong . 
We don &apos;t want companies to patent lives . 
We don &apos;t want companies to own seeds . 
And you know what ? My answer to all of this is , 
&quot; Yes , you &apos;re right . &quot; Let &apos;s fix that . 
It &apos;s true . We have a huge food problem . But that &apos;s not science . 
That &apos;s not science . 
It &apos;s right . Moral patent crab . 
You know that science is not a company . 
It &apos;s not a country . 
It &apos;s not even an idea . It &apos;s a process . 
It &apos;s a process . And sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t . But the idea that we don &apos;t want to allow science to do its work . Because we &apos;re afraid . Is it a real impasse ? And it keeps millions of people from flourishing . 
You know , over the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to grow 70 percent more food . Do you have to grow 70 percent more food than we have at the moment , that 
investment in Africa over the last 30 years ? 
Shameful , shameful . 
You need that , and we give it to you . Not , 
and why ? Genetically . Modified food . 
We don &apos;t want to encourage people to do this rotten stuff . Eat , like Maniok Maniok , Maniok 
is something that &apos;s half a billion people eat . 
It &apos;s about like a potato . 
It &apos;s just a bunch of calories . It &apos;s bad . 
It doesn &apos;t have nutrients . It doesn &apos;t have protein . And scientists are building all this right now . Inside of it , 
and then people could eat it . And wouldn &apos;t it be blind ? 
They wouldn &apos;t starve . And you know what ? 
That would be nice . It wouldn &apos;t be Chez . Panisse , but it would be nice , 
and everything I can say about it is , why do we fight this ? 
I mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why ? Let &apos;s fight this 
. Because we don &apos;t want to push genes around . 
It &apos;s not about pushing genes around . It &apos;s not about chemicals . 
It &apos;s not about our ridiculous ones . It &apos;s about passion for hormones . It &apos;s about insisting on more food . It &apos;s about better food . It &apos;s about unique food . 
It &apos;s not about rice . Crispirs , it &apos;s about keeping people alive . And it &apos;s high time to understand . What that means , 
because you know what 
if we don &apos;t do that ? If we go on doing what we do , we start doing it . Something guilty of it . I don &apos;t think we do . We want to be guilty of high @-@ tech colonialism . 
There &apos;s no other description . For what &apos;s happening here , 
it &apos;s selfish . It &apos;s ugly . It &apos;s not worthy of us . And we really have to stop that . 
After this incredibly fun conversation , you might want to say , &quot; Do you still want to be in this ridiculous ? &quot; Time machine and going into the future 
, definitely . I want that anyway . 
She &apos;s in the present moment . But we have an incredible opportunity . 
We can put this time machine on everything . What we want , 
we can move it . Where we move it . We want it , and we will get it there . Move where we want it . 
We need to have these conversations . And we need to think . But if we go into the time machine and go into the future . We &apos;ll be glad we did that . 
I know we did it . And as far as I &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs now . 
Thank you . 
Thank you . When Steve Lopez , columnist of the Los Angeles Times , one day , walked through the streets in the center of Los Angeles . Did he hear wonderful music ? 
She came from a man , an African @-@ American , sympathetic . Rough homeless , who played on a violin . The only two strings left 
, many of them will know the story . Because from Steve &apos;s article about it , later on , a book was filmed . Robert Downey Junior , when Steve Lopez and Jamie Foxx , when Nathaniel Anthony . Ayers , the contrabass player who studied at the Juilliard Conservatory , and whose promising career tragically early on through his paranoid career . Schizophrenia ended . 
Nathaniel left Juilliard , suffered a nervous breakdown , and 30 years later he lived as homeless on the streets of Skid Row . In the center of Los Angeles , 
I recommend to you all Steves &apos; book . Read or watch the movie . So you can not only understand the wonderful connection . The interconnection that has emerged between these two men , but also how the music creates that connection . Helped and how they eventually were the instrument when this play of words is allowed , that helped . Nathaniel , away from the street , get rid of the street , 
I met Mr. Ayers in 2008 . Two years ago in the Walt Disney Concert Hall , 
he just had a demonstration . Of Beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , heard and came behind the stage to imagine myself . 
He spoke in a very cheerful and savory tone . About Yo @-@ Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and about how the Dodgers never made it into baseball world . Series : And all of this because of the insidious passage . The first violin in the last sentence of Beethoven &apos;s Fourth Symphony : 
&quot; We got to the topic . &quot; &quot; Speaking music and a few days later , I got an email saying , &quot; That Nathaniel was advocating violin lessons with me . 
&quot; I have to mention that Nathaniel was refusing medical treatment , because he was already in the process of electroshocks and thorazine . And handcuffs were being treated . A trauma that his entire life has 
been following him as a result of that is now particularly vulnerable . For these schizophrenic phases , which are sometimes so bad that they can threaten to tear him apart . And he disappears for days . In the streets of Skid Row , this horror is always wandering around . And the torturing torment of his own mind , 
and in just such a charming stage , Nathaniel was when we were in our first lesson in Walt Disney Concert Hall . He started this crazy flicker in his eyes . And he was totally lost . 
He talked about invisible . Demons and smoke and about how someone in sleep poison him . 
Want I to be afraid ? Not for me , but for me , I was afraid . I was afraid I was losing him . Could he be in one of his states ? And that I was giving him a break in his relationship with the violin . Could I , when I started talking about clay ladders and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic ? Violin pedagogy . 
So I just started . Play . 
I played the first sentence of Beethoven . Violin Concerto . 
And as I played , I noticed that in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes , there was a complete change . 
It was as if under the influence of an invisible doctor . A chemical reaction , whose catalyst was my game , 
turned Nathaniel &apos;s maniac anger . Understanding , into a calm curiosity and grace , 
and like through a miracle , he took his violin . And began to listen . Some excerpts of violin concerts to play . And then asked me to finish them . Play Mendelssohn , Chaikovsky , Sibelius . 
And we started playing music . Talk about Bach , starting with Bach . About Beethoven , Brahms , Bruckner and all the other BS of Bartók . Right up to ESA @-@ Pekka Salonen , 
and I realized that he wasn &apos;t just an encyclopedic knowledge of music . He was also very close to his personal relationship . He talked about her . 
He talked about her with a passion and an understanding that I would otherwise only have to share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic . 
Knowing by playing music . And talking about music was confused by this paranoid man . He was just walking through the streets of Los Angeles . A lovely , educated man . Excellent at Juilliard . Teacher @ musication. 
Have become ( Music ) Is medicine ? ( Music ) Changes 
For Nathaniel , music means music . Eligible health , 
because music allows him to have his thoughts and delusions through his imagination and creativity . Reform into something real , 
and so he escapes his torment . 
Status : I understood that this is the essence of art . 
This is precisely why we make music . So that we can make something deep inside of us all . Our emotions through our artistic lens , through our creativity , into reality . Shapes can shape 
and the reality of that expression . Achieves us all . And moves inspired . And unites us what 
Nathaniel was about . So music brought him . Back to a community . Friends , 
the redeeming power of music brought him back . In a family of musicians who understood him , who recognized his talent . And he respected him , 
and I &apos;ll play with Nathaniel again and again . Whether in Walt Disney Concert Hall or in Skid Row , because he reminds me of this why I &apos;m becoming a musician . 
Thank you very much . 
Bruno Giussani : Thank you very much . Thank you . 
Robert Gupta : 
Robert Gupta : I want to play something . I shamefully stolen the cellist . 
I hope you forgive me . 
I &apos;m Jane McGonigal . I design computer games . I develop . 
I &apos;ve been developing for 10 years now . Online games and my goal for the next decade . Is it just as easy to make ? The world in reality to save . How to save it in online games is 
, I have a plan for it . I want to convince more people . Including all of you , more time to play bigger and more amazing . 
Spending games : We &apos;re spending three billion hours a week now . With online games , 
some of you might think , &quot; Well , that &apos;s a lot . Time for games , 
maybe a little too much . &quot; Time , considering how many problems we &apos;re facing in the real world to solve urgently . But 
in fact , I &apos;ve been doing research at the Institute for the Future , and that &apos;s exactly the opposite . Right ? 
Three billion hours a week . Isn &apos;t nearly enough ? To address the world &apos;s most pressing problems , 
actually , I &apos;m convinced that if we do the next century on this planet , we want to survive this time dramatically . 
I &apos;ve calculated . That the time needed is 21 billion hours of play a week 
, which may seem a little bit absurd first . So I repeat it so it can work if we can have problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity . I think we need to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week by the end of the next decade . 
No . I mean it really . Ernst . 
Why ? This 
picture quite accurately describes why . I think games are so vital to the survival of the human species in the future . 
Are they serious ? This is a portrait of the photographer . Phil Toledano : 
He wanted to capture the feelings of playing . So he &apos;s got a camera built in front of the players . This is one 
of the classic expressions of playing . 
If you &apos;re not a player , you may miss some of the nuances in this picture . 
You probably see this sense of urgency . A little bit of fear . But also extreme concentration , deeply deepened . In solving a really difficult problem , even 
if you &apos;re playing . See some nuances . Here &apos;s the upward . Eyes drawn . And the mouth is a sign of optimism . The eyebrows show surprise . 
This is a player on the edge of what &apos;s called an epic victory . 
Oh , you know that ? 
OK . Great . So we have some players here , 
an epic victory is . One result that &apos;s so extraordinarily positive that you didn &apos;t even know before that it was possible at all . 
It was almost beyond imagination . And if you get there , you &apos;re shocked that you &apos;re actually capable of doing 
that . This is an epical victory . 
This player is about to be an epic . Victory , 
and this is what we see on millions of faces of problem solvers around the world . Must we , if we &apos;re going to tackle the hurdles of the next century , face those who face the hurdles of all adversity on the edge of an epic ? Siegfried 
, well , unfortunately , look . We &apos;re more of that face . In real life , when we face difficult problems , 
I call it that in life , I &apos;m . I &apos;m bad face . 
And it &apos;s actually my face . Look , yeah . OK . 
That &apos;s me . How I &apos;m in life . I &apos;m bad face . Do 
this . This is a graffiti . In my former home country in Berkeley , California , where I studied in my Ph.D. thesis why we &apos;re better at playing . Than in real life , 
that &apos;s a problem . That &apos;s a lot of players we think 
we don &apos;t really do well in reality . Like in play . And 
I mean , not only less successful . Although that &apos;s part of it , 
we get more in play worlds , 
I mean , good in context . Motivating something meaningful to do , inspired by working with each other 
when we &apos;re in a game world . I think many of us are immersed in our best version . Ready to help at any time and immediately , persistent . Solving the problem , trying to solve it as long as necessary , try it again after failure , 
and in reality , when we fail , when we encounter obstacles . We often feel different . We feel overwhelmed . 
We feel defeated . We feel threatened . Maybe depressed . Frustrated , right ? Cynical , these feelings have . 
We never , when we play games , in games , they just exist . Not , 
and that &apos;s it . What I wanted to do as a PhD student is 
, why is it in games ? Impossible . Think you couldn &apos;t just achieve everything . 
How can we get these feelings out of play into reality ? 
So I looked at games like &quot; World of Warcraft . &quot; This is the ideal environment for solving problems in a community , 
and I &apos;ve noticed a few things : Epic victories . In online worlds , 
making it possible , first of all , when you enter one of these online games , especially at World of Warcraft . Is there a lot of different characters ? They &apos;re ready to give you a world saving . Mission , immediately , 
but not . Just some mission , but a mission . Perfect to your current level in the game . 
Right ? So they do . 
They never get a task . They can &apos;t solve it . 
But always on the edge of their abilities , so they have to make an effort , 
but there &apos;s no unemployment . In World of Warcraft , you &apos;re not sitting around . And they turn around , dams . They always have a very specific focus . Something important . To do , and 
there are a couple of times . 
Staff members , wherever they go . Hundreds of thousands of people working with them to complete their epic mission , 
we have in real life . Not so easy . This feeling that , when you have fingerprints , staff are willing to do it in ways that are available , 
and there are also : There &apos;s this epic story . This inspiring story , why we &apos;re there . And what we have to do is we get this whole positive story . 
Feedback : You &apos;ve certainly got from level . Up and 1 . Strength . Listened . Or 1 . Intelligence . 
This constant feedback . Is there not ? In real life , 
when I leave this stage , I don &apos;t . 1 . Speak and 1 . Crazy idea . 20 . Crazy . 
Idea . I get in real life . 
This feedback , not so the problem of collaborative online worlds like World of Warcraft . Is it so satisfying ? Anytime on the edge of an epic victory . To stand by that we prefer to be in these game worlds all 
the time , they &apos;re just better . Than the 
reality , until now , all World of Warcraft players have in common . 5.93 million years spent virtual problems with the virtual problems of Azeroth . 
That &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing . 
It may sound bad . But let &apos;s take a 
look at it in context : 5.93 million years ago . Our first primate ancestors started walking upright . 
The first upright primacy , 
OK ? So when we talk about how much time we have to spend playing at the moment . Does that make sense ? When do you spend time with regard to the scale of human development ? When you look at what &apos;s 
extraordinary , but also when you look at it . Because it turns out that by doing this whole time , we &apos;re playing . In fact , changing what we as humans are able to do . 
We &apos;re becoming too cooperative . Thinking , heartfelt beings . 
That &apos;s the truth . I believe that &apos;s 
what I think you &apos;ll look at once . The recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University . The average young person today in a country with a strong playing culture spends . 10,000 hours playing online until the age of 21 . 
So 10,000 hours is a very interesting number . For two reasons : 
First , for children . In the United States , 10,080 hours is the exact total time they spend in school . From fifth grade to the end of high school . If you never miss it , 
so here we have a complete parallel education path where young people learn the same thing that it means . A good player to be like anything else they do in school , And maybe 
some of you have the new book by Malcolm Gladwell , &quot; Overflying Flyer . &quot; So you know his theory . Of success , the theory of success , the 10,000 @-@ hour @-@ long story . 
It &apos;s based on the great one . Cognitive science research that if we spend 10,000 hours with laborious study of any subject , until we 21 years of age . We will be able to master . In that , 
we will be as good at whatever . To do as the most important people in the world 
, what we have here . Is a complete generation ? Young people , the master players , 
are the big question . So , what exactly are players ? Masterly good . Because 
if we could figure out that out , we would have almost never known before . Human potential available to 
so many people , we currently have in the world , who have at least an hour a day playing online , and 
these are our master players , 500 million people . The extraordinarily good things are in something , 
and in the next decade . Do we have another billion ? Players who are extraordinarily good . Anyway , 
if you &apos;re still doing it , you know ? Have 
the game industry developed ? Consoles , the energy . Save and work on mobile networks . Instead of broadband Internet , so that players around the world , especially in India , China . Brazil , playing online , 
you can expect . An additional billion players over the next decade , 
so we &apos;ve got a total of 1.5 billion players , 
so I started . Thinking about what it is , what these games are to master . 
Here &apos;s the four . Things I found first : Urgency optimism , 
OK ? Imagine how extreme self @-@ motivation . 
Urgent optimism is desire . Immediately to do something . Mastery a hurdle , along with believing that we have a reasonable hope of success . 
Players always believe that an epical victory is possible . And that it &apos;s always worth trying . And that &apos;s equal to players . 
Don &apos;t sit around . 
Players are champions in spiders . Poet social networks : 
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research . They show that we like people more after we play with them . Even if they &apos;ve defeated us badly , 
the reason it &apos;s a lot of trust requires . With someone playing a game , 
we trust somebody will have time with us . That the rules are being respected , that we have the same goal . And by the end of the game , 
so playing together allows for the growth of ties , trust and interconnectedness as 
a result . We build stronger social relationships of that . 
Happy productivity . Fantastic . 
You know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of Warcraft players plays 22 hours a week . So as part @-@ time job , 
the reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier at it . Working hard than when we relax . Or nothing . Do 
we know that we as human beings function optimally ? When we do hard , significant work , 
and players are always ready . Working hard . When they get the right job and 
eventually epic meaning , 
they love players . It &apos;s part of awe @-@ inspiring . Planetary Dimensions Missions . 
So here &apos;s a background information to get this right . You probably know all Wikipedia . The biggest Wiki in the world , the 
second largest Wiki . The world with almost 80,000 entries . Is the World of Warcraft ? Wiki 
: Five million people use it every month . 
They have more information . About World of Warcraft online , collected than about any other topic . In any other Wiki in the world , 
they create an epic . 
History : They create an epic . Source of knowledge about the World of Warcraft , 
OK ? So these are four superpowers . They have a single result : Players are super @-@ powerful , hopeful . 
Individuals : They are people who believe that as individuals they change the world . 
And the only problem is they believe they can change the virtual worlds . But not the real ones . 
That &apos;s the problem . Solving the I &apos;m trying to solve is 
Edward Castronova . A scientist , 
his work . Is awesome 
? He &apos;s studying why . People have so much time . Energy and money . Spend online worlds , 
and he says , &quot; We &apos;re witnessing no less than mass emigration to virtual worlds . &quot; And online gaming environments , 
and this by an economist , so he &apos;s logical . 
And he doesn &apos;t say the way I develop , &quot; Play , I &apos;m a little exuberant . 
&quot; So he says , &quot; That actually makes sense . &quot; Because players can achieve more in online worlds than in real life . 
They can play games with stronger social ties . When in real life , they get more feedback . And rewards in games than in real life , 
so he says , &quot; It &apos;s perfectly logical right now . &quot; That players have more time in the virtual world than they have in real life . 
I &apos;ll just agree . That &apos;s logical . 
But it &apos;s definitely . It &apos;s not an optimal situation . 
We have to start turning the real world into a game . 
My inspiration comes from an event that took 2,500 years . 
There are these ancient cubes of sheep &apos;s cocks , 
you know ? In front of these fantastic game econtrollers , there were sheep &apos;s cocks , 
and these were , so to speak , the first of people to develop . Play equipment , and if you &apos;re working with the works of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus , you might know this story . The story about how and why ? 
Play was invented according to Herodotus . Games , more precisely craps in the kingdom of Lydia during famine . 
There was supposedly such a great famine . That the king of Lydia turned into a crazy idea , 
people suffered , people fought , It 
was an extreme situation . It took an extreme solution . 
So they invented the craps according to Herodotus and agreed a national strategy . In one day you would eat . The next day you would play , 
and they would be so much into the craps . You &apos;d be more deeply immersed there . Games so fascinating . Are and we &apos;re more satisfying . Happy productivity . Surrounded by that , you would forget . That there was nothing to eat . 
And then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat 
and , according to Herodotus , survived . You would survive this famine for 18 years . By living in one day and eating the next , 
I think the same . Let &apos;s start playing today , we &apos;ll start playing games to respond 
to the suffering of the real world . We &apos;ll start playing games to help you escape everything . That in the real world doesn &apos;t work . Everything that works in real life . Not satisfying . Is it , and we &apos;ll get what we need ? From the games , 
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end . 
That &apos;s the exciting thing 
, loud , herodotus . After 18 years of famine , wasn &apos;t it better ? So the king decided to start a final dice game , and 
they divided the kingdom into two halves . 
They played a dice game . And the winners were allowed to be an epic adventure . 
They left lydia and set out on the search . A new home . They just left so many people behind as food to survive . And they were looking for a neighborhood with the rest of them to thrive . 
Could that sound crazy ? 
Or , latest DNA evidence ? Show that the Etruscans , who later formed the Roman Empire , had the same DNA as the old lydians . 
So scientists recently came to the conclusion that herodotus , crazy story , is actually true . 
And geologists found evidence of global cooling . The nearly 20 years took to explain famine . 
So could this crazy story be true ? Maybe 
they actually have their people through play . Saved . By 18 years in games , they flew and then these games inspired , And so much about coexistence . Play learned that it would save the whole civilization . 
So we can do that , too . 
We can play . Since 1994 Warcraft 
, this was the first strategy game . In real time , the World of Warcraft series , 
this was 16 years ago . 
They played for 18 years . Craps , we &apos;ve been playing for 16 years . Warcraft : 
I &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready . We &apos;re ready for our own epic game , 
so they sent half of their civilization . They were looking for a new world , so I &apos;m taking my 21 billion hours of play a week . 
We should agree that half of us are one hour a day with games , right ? Until we solve the problems of the real 
world . I know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; How do we solve problems of the real world ? &quot; 
In games , and that &apos;s exactly the question I &apos;ve been doing in recent years at the Institute for the Future . 
We &apos;ve got this banner in our office . In Palo Alto , it expresses how we understand the future . Should 
we not try ? Should we try to tell the future beforehand 
what we want is the future . To create , 
we want the best possible outcome . Imagine then empowering people . This idea of turning into reality , 
we face epic victories . Imagine and give people the opportunity to reach them . 
I &apos;ll show you very briefly . Three games I designed . Have to try to make people epic victories in their own future . 
This is world . Without oil , 
the game . From 2007 , 
it &apos;s an online game . In which you have to overcome an oil shortage , 
oil scarcity is invented . But we have enough online content to make it realistic for you . And you actually , your real life without oil . So , live when you sign up for the game . Tell us where you live . And then you get real @-@ time news movies . They show you how much oil costs . What there is not , how food supplies are impaired , 
how transport costs . Whether schools are closed . Whether there are riots . And you have to figure out how to shape your real life . If it were true , and we ask you to blog about it . Set videos or photos . 
We have this 1 game . 700 players . Tested in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been testing it for the last three years . 
And I can tell you , it was a changing experience . 
Nobody wants his life . Change because it &apos;s good for the environment . Or because we should . 
But if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and you &apos;re told , &quot; We &apos;re going to get the oil out . 
&quot; This is a fascinating thing . Adventure . You can find the one you &apos;re going to do . 
You can find out how you survive . If most of our players were to have it . The habits learned in the game would be maintained . 
So we opted for the next world saving game , a bigger , higher goal . We put ourselves in place than just oil shortages . 
We have the game . Superstruct at the Institute . For the future . 
Developed starting point . Is the calculation ? A supercomputer that people only have 23 years left on the planet for the next time . 
This supercomputer is called Global Dismortality Sensitization System , of course , the call . 
To players to sign up . Do we have almost designed a Jerry Bruckheimer movie ? 
You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies , where there &apos;s the dream team . You have the astronaut , the scientist , the ex @-@ Sträfling , and just together . Can you save the world ? 
But in our game , instead of just five people , we say , &quot; Everyone &apos;s on the dream team , and it &apos;s our job . &quot; The future for energy , food , health . Safety and the future of social justice . To 
create 8,000 players , the game played 8 . For weeks , 
they found 500 incredible . Creative solutions that they can read when they Google Superstruct and 
the last game . We released on March 3rd . It &apos;s a game . Working with the World Bank , when 
you complete the game , you get . You get the World Bank award for &quot; Social Reformer 2010 &quot; — we work 
with universities . All over Sub @-@ Saharan Africa , and invite you to redesign socially . Learning : 
We have a comic book on this . We have levels high for regional understanding . Knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and ingenuity . 
I want to invite you all to play this game with young people . Everywhere in the world , especially in development areas , that benefit from it . Together , you can imagine your own social ventures to save the world . 
Now , I &apos;m going to finish . 
I want to ask you something . 
What do you think ? Next ? 
We have all these fantastic players . We have games that show us what we do . But can we have the real world not yet saved 
? Well , I hope you agree with me that players are human resources . We are working in real life , and we can use games to make a difference to change . 
We have all these superpowers , happy productivity . The ability to build strong social networks , urgency optimism and the desire for epics . Importance : 
I really hope that together we play important games . To play another century on this planet to survive , and 
I hope you will join me in playing these games . Design and play . 
When I look forward to the next decade , I &apos;m on two things . Certainly , we &apos;re able to create every imaginable future , and we &apos;re playing all kinds of games . So can I say , let &apos;s play the world @-@ changing games . Let &apos;s start . 
Thank you . 
For some time now , I &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect . It may seem strange . It &apos;s interesting that a magician is interested , unless you look at it like me , as a deception that leads to something real . If someone is just firmly enough to believe in it , 
in other words , sugar pills have had measurable effects in some studies . The placebo effect , and only because the person thinks what to do with it . Be a pharmaceutical . Or some kind of pain management . For example , if the patient is only firm enough to believe in it , there &apos;s a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect . 
A deception . Will become something real ? Because somebody perceives it like this . 
So that we also understand each other , I want to give you an elementary , very simple magic trick . 
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . This is a trick . It &apos;s been a trick that &apos;s been for kids in every magic book since the 1950s at least . 
I myself took it from the Cub Scout Magic . The scout in the 1970s , 
I &apos;m going to do it for you . And then explain it , 
and then I &apos;m going to explain it . Why ? I explain it . 
So you see what happens . 
The knife you can look at , my hand you &apos;re looking at . Can 
I just look at the knife in my fist ? 
I &apos;m pushing my sleeves back . 
And to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeves or comes out of it . Will I just put my wrist right here ? 
So you can see . That at no time is anything moving as long as I &apos;m pressurizing here . Can &apos;t anything go in my sleeves ? Or come out , 
and the goal is quite simple : 
I &apos;m going to open my hand . And hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife will go through my bare physical magnetism . 
It &apos;s actually stuck so tight . In its place , I can shake it . Without the knife falling down , nothing moves . 
In my sleeves , or comes out , no trickery , and you can study everything . 
TA @-@ DA : 
Well , this is a trick I often teach small kids . Which are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception . If you look more closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick to do . 
I think many of you in this room probably know . This trick , 
it works . Here &apos;s how 
I hold the knife . In my hand , 
I say I &apos;m closing my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears . Or comes out , and this is a lie . 
The reason I &apos;m holding my wrist is because it &apos;s the real secret of the illusion . 
The moment I get my hand from you , that is , the moment I turn away . So you see it from behind , this finger moves here . My index finger just moves from there . Where it was , into a position where it &apos;s stretched out like this . 
Great trick . 
There &apos;s somebody sitting back there who had no childhood , 
so he &apos;s right here , 
and when I turn around , the finger changes its position , 
and now you could talk about it . Why ? One deception is why . You don &apos;t perceive . That down here , you only see three fingers . Because the mind and the way it &apos;s processing information are not individually . Number one , two , three . But it sees you as a group , 
but that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about . Now , actually , here , not at all . And then I open my hand , of 
course , it &apos;s held there . But not by magnetism . My body , but by a trick . By my index finger , which is there now , 
and when I close my hand , the same thing happens by turning back . It &apos;s hidden by this movement that the finger moves back , 
I take that hand away . And here &apos;s the knife . 
You can do this trick to your friends and neighbors . Thank you . 
Now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ? 
A year ago or so , I read a study that really bypassed me . Has 
I not been a doctor ? Or a researcher , and that &apos;s why it was for me . An amazing thing . Because what 
it turned out is that if you had a placebo in the form of a white pill , you would have a place . In the form of an aspirin tablet , that &apos;s easy . A round white pill . Those have a certain measurable effect , 
but if you have the shape in which you give placebo , for example , into a smaller pill , you change it . And you color those blue and you embosse a letter on it , it &apos;s actually measurable . More effective , and 
even though none of them are any pharmaceutical ones . Just sugar pills , 
but a white pill is not so good . Like a blue pill , 
which made it . Really ? Flipping out . 
It turned out that &apos;s not all that yet . 
If you take capsules , they &apos;re even more effective than tablets of any shape . 
A colored capsule that &apos;s yellow at one end and red at the other . Is better than a white one ? 
Capsule : The dosage . Does it matter 
? A pill twice . Not so good every day . Like three pills , I can &apos;t get to the exact statistics now . Sorry . 
But the key thing is that 
the dosage also plays a role . 
And the shape plays a role . 
And if you have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to grab the needle . 
Right ? An injection . With an ineffective one , a few milliliters , an ineffective one . Substance that you inject into a patient , 
which creates a very strong image . In your head , that &apos;s a lot . Stronger than a white pill . 
This graph is really , I &apos;m going to show you another time . If we have a projector , so 
the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work so well . Like the blue pill , which doesn &apos;t work so well . Like a capsule . Not so good . It works like the needle . 
And none of it . Does any really pharmaceutical ? Feature : It &apos;s just our belief in it . The one in us has a stronger effect . 
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a magic trick . 
Could I take something that is obviously a deception ? And let it be real . 
Look , we know . From that study , you have to grab the needle if you go to the point . Should 
this be an 18 @-@ inch @-@ long needle ? It &apos;s very , very sharp . And I &apos;m going to sterilize it a little bit first . 
This is really my flesh . It &apos;s not Damian &apos;s . Special bred meat , this one . 
Is my skin ? This is not a special effect . Hollywood : 
I &apos;m going to put this needle in my skin . And through it , I &apos;m going to push it up until it &apos;s going to leave on the other side . 
If it gets you wrong , if you &apos;re easily fainted , I have some friends . Last night . Shown in the hotel room and some people I didn &apos;t know , and there &apos;s a woman almost fainting . 
So I propose , if you &apos;re quickly getting sick , look for the next 30 or so seconds away . Or , you know what ? I &apos;m going to get the first delicate part back here . 
You can see it in a moment . But you can also look away if you want . 
So it &apos;s going to be so accurate here . Where my meat starts , at the bottom of my arm , I &apos;m just going to make a little bit of a break . Do 
I really ? Sorry . That &apos;s crazy . And now 
, just . A little bit . Through my skin and on the other side , back out like this . 
Now we &apos;re actually in the same situation . We had the knife trick , 
about , 
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers . Or so I &apos;m 
going to show you . This is one , two , three , four , five . 
Well , yeah . 
I know what people think . If you see that , 
you say , &quot; Okay . &quot; That &apos;s certain . Not so . Bold and pierce yourself . Just skin around us for a few minutes to entertain . 
Well , then I &apos;ll show you . 
What does this look like ? Very good . 
Yes . I know , and people in the back . Say , okay . I didn &apos;t get it right . See 
. People in the side rooms are now coming in . 
Let me tell you . Close up , this is 
really my skin . This is not a special effect . 
Hollywood , this is my flesh . And I can turn this around . 
I &apos;m sorry if you &apos;re getting bad , look away . Don &apos;t look . Go . 
People in the back , or those who sometime later see this on video . Will you say , &quot; Well , yeah , that looks pretty good . &quot; Impressive . But if it were real , he would see , &quot; Here &apos;s a hole . &quot; And there , if it was really real , it would bleed . 
Okay ? Let me just add a little blood to you . 
Yeah . Here it is . 
Normally , I would take out the needle now . 
I would clean my arm . And show you that there are no wounds there . 
But I think in this frame here and with the intent . A deception to make something real . Will I just put the needle in there ? Let &apos;s let it go from 
the stage , we &apos;ll move in the next few days a few times . 
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . Thank you very much . 
So I &apos;ve had a lot of fish in my life . 
I just loved two . 
This first one was more like a passionate affair . 
It was a beautiful fish . It was tasty , good consistency . Hold , a bestseller . On the menu , 
what better fish he got . 
In aquaculture , according to the supposedly highest standards of sustainability , 
you could probably feel comfortable . Selling it . 
I had a beauty relationship with this for several months , 
one day , the boss of the company called and asked if I was growing up at an event . Could I talk about the sustainability of the farm 
? Of course , I said , 
&quot; Here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem had become for our chefs . Is it like , do we keep fish ? On our menus in 
the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the seas . How do we beat forests bare 
? It &apos;s hard to overestimate destruction . 
90 percent of the big fish we love , the tuna , the cures , the salmon , the swordfish . They &apos;ve collapsed . 
It &apos;s almost nothing more . 
So there &apos;s probably some aquaculture left , or bad aquaculture . Fish farming , part of our future . 
His many arguments against it . Fish farming plants pollute the environment , most of them anyway , and they &apos;re inefficient . Let &apos;s take tuna . A big disadvantage . 
It &apos;s got 15 percent feed recovery 
, which is 15 pounds of wild fish . It &apos;s necessary to get a pound of farmed tuna , 
not very sustainable . 
It doesn &apos;t taste very sustainable either . 
Very good . So here was finally a company . It tried to get it right . 
I wanted to support it . 
The day before the event , I called the head of public relations for the company . 
Let &apos;s call him Don . 
Don said . I just said the facts . Right ? You &apos;re famous for that . So far out in the sea . Growing . That you don &apos;t pollute the environment 
, that &apos;s true . He said , &quot; We &apos;re so far out that the waste is distributed by our fish . &quot; Not concentrated . And 
then he added . &quot; We &apos;re essentially a world of our own . 
This 2.5 percent feed recovery to one , &quot; he said , 
&quot; the best in the industry , 2.5 percent . &quot; 
&quot; One , great , 
2.5 percent to one . What do you feed ? &quot; 
&quot; Sustainable proteins , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Great . &quot; I said , &quot; I got up , 
and that evening I lay in bed and thought , &quot; What the hell ? &quot; &quot; Is sustainable ? 
&quot; Protein . &quot; So the next day , just before the event , I called . Don : 
I said , &quot; Don , what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot; 
He said , &quot; He doesn &apos;t know . &quot; He &apos;s going to 
ask , &quot; Well , I telephoned a few people in the company , nobody could give me a proper answer . &quot; &quot; Give me a good answer until I finally telephoned with the leading biologist . 
&quot; Let &apos;s call him . Don Don , 
too , I said , &quot; What , for example , are they ? &quot; 
Sustainable proteins . Well , he mentioned some algae . And some fishmeal , and then he said , &quot; Chicken pellets . &quot; 
I said , Chicken pellets . He 
said , &quot; Yes . &quot; Feathers , skin . Bone flour . Remnants . Dried and foraged . Processed . 
I said , &quot; How much percent of your food ? &quot; 
Is chicken , assuming maybe two percent ? 
Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent . He said , &quot; 
I said , don , what &apos;s sustainable ? &quot; &quot; Chicken to feed fish . &quot; 
There was a long break . There was a long break in the pipeline , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much . Chicken in the world . &quot; 
I fell in love with this fish . 
No . Not . Because I &apos;m a self @-@ righteous connoisseur and a good man . 
That &apos;s me . Even 
no . I actually have no of this fish . Dear because I swear to God , the fish after this conversation , tasted chicken . Has 
this second fish ? That &apos;s another fish . Type of love story . 
It &apos;s the romantic species . The way you ever better get your fish . Do you learn the fish ? The more you love it . 
I first loved it in a restaurant in southern Spain . 
A friend journalist . She had long been talking about this fish . It has 
kind of cuffed us , 
it came on the table . With a bright , almost shimmering white color . 
The cook had cooked it , 
just twice . 
Amazingly , it was still . Delicious . 
Who can make a fish ? So good . Taste . After he was cooked . 
I can &apos;t , but this guy can call it . 
We call it Miguel . In fact , he &apos;s called Miguel . 
And no . He doesn &apos;t have the fish . Chewed . And he &apos;s not a chef . At least in the way you and I understand it , 
he &apos;s a biologist at Veta . La Palma , 
this is a fish rearing in the southwest . Corner of Spain , 
it &apos;s near the mouth . It &apos;s from the river Guadalquivir , 
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of Argentines , 
they grew meat cattle on what were essentially wetlands . 
They did this by draining the land . 
They built this complicated sequence of canals , and they pushed water out of the country . And out into the river . 
Well , they couldn &apos;t make a difference . That didn &apos;t work economically 
and ecologically . It was a disaster . 
It brought about 90 percent . The birds around , which is a lot of birds in this place . 
And so in 1982 , a Spanish company with environmental awareness bought the land . 
What did they do ? 
They bought the river of water around . 
They literally laid the lever . 
Instead of pushing the water out , they used the channels to pull the water back in . 
They flooded the channels . 
They created an 11,000 hectares . Fish farming , perch , sea ash , shrimp . Eel . And so Miguel and his company have ecological destruction completely reversed . 
The farm is incredible . 
I mean , they &apos;ve never seen anything like this before . 
They &apos;re staring out . They &apos;re on the horizon . One million miles away . Is and everything you see is flooded . Channels and this dense , lush march . 
I wasn &apos;t there long ago . With Miguel , 
he &apos;s an incredible guy . Three parts : Charles Darwin and one part : A crocodile . To kiss , 
okay , we were there fighting . We were through wetlands , and I chash and sweat , I got mud up to my knees , and Miguel keeps quiet . A biology lecture 
here , he highlights a rare track . 
Now he mentions the mineral needs of phytoplankton , 
and here he sees a pattern . Of bundles that he &apos;s looking at . Tanzanian giraffe reminds us . 
It turns out Miguel is the majority of his career in Mikumi National Park in Africa . 
I asked him how he was going to be a fish expert . 
He said , &quot; Fish , I don &apos;t know . On fish , 
I &apos;m an expert in relationships . And 
then he goes and falls into more talk . On rare birds and algae and strange aquatic plants , 
and you know ? Not wrong . It was really fascinating . You know , the biotic community , unplugged , in the way 
it &apos;s great , but I was in love . 
And my head got weak . Over this cooked piece of delicious fish that I had on the eve . 
So I interrupted it . I said , Miguel . How does it come ? That your fish tastes so good . He 
pointed to algae . 
I know boy , the algae of phytoplankton . The relationships , that &apos;s incredible . 
But what do your fish eat ? 
How is the feed recovery ? Well 
, he goes on . To tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system . That the fish eat what they eat in the wilderness . 
The vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , that &apos;s what the fish feed . 
The system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self @-@ explanatory . 
There &apos;s no food . 
Ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , 
later on the day . I drove on this plot with Miguel . Around . And I asked him , &quot; I said , for a place that seems so natural , unlike any farm . On which I &apos;d ever been , how do you measure success ? &quot; 
The moment it was like a film director was demanding a stage change . 
And we were bowing around the corner , and we had the most incredible sight . Thousands and thousands of pinkers , flamingos . A literally pinker . Carpet as far as the eye is . 
Is that enough ? Is that success ? He said , 
&quot; Look at her bellies . &quot; Pink . 
They &apos;re smuggling , slugging 
. I was completely confused . 
I said Miguel . Don &apos;t mess . Don &apos;t mess your fish . Yes 
. He said , &quot; We &apos;re losing 20 . 
&quot; Percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds . 
Now , last year , 600,000 people were on this site . More than 250 different species . 
It &apos;s the largest one today , and one of the most important private bird reserves in Europe . I became a member of the community , and 
I said , &quot; Miguel is a well @-@ thriving bird population , not the last one to be reared on a fish farm . If 
he wants to shake his head , no . 
&quot; He said , &quot; We &apos;re building extensively , not . Intense 
this . &quot; Is an ecological network ? 
The flamingos eat the shrimps . 
The shrimps eat the phytoplankton 
the closer the belly , the better the system . Okay 
? Let &apos;s think about this . A farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals . And a farm that can succeed in the health of its predators . 
A fish rearing , but also a bird reserve . 
Oh , and by the way , these flamingos shouldn &apos;t even be there from the outset . 
They breed 240 kilometers away in a city . Where the soil is better for nest maintenance , fly 
every morning . They fly 240 kilometers to the farm . 
And every night they fly 240 kilometers . Back . 
They do that because they &apos;re on the crocheted white line of the A92 highway . 
Seriously , 
I had a kind of trip that penguins had imagined . So I looked at Miguel . 
I said Miguel . Fly 240 . Kilometers to the farm , and then fly them . 240 kilometers back in the evening 
. Do that for the kids . He 
looked at me as if I had just heard a song by Whitney Houston , and 
he said , &quot; No , you &apos;re doing that . Because the food is better . &quot; 
I don &apos;t have the skin of my lover . I mentioned fish . The delicious . Was not , and I don &apos;t like , fish skin . I like it . Not sauté . I like it . Not . 
Chespy . It &apos;s this biting . Cooked taste : 
I almost never cook with it , and 
yet , when I put it to this restaurant in southern Spain , it didn &apos;t have fish skin at all . 
It tasted sweet . And it &apos;s as if you had to take a bite from the ocean . 
I mentioned that to Miguel , and he nodded . 
He said , &quot; The skin looks like a sponge . 
&quot; It &apos;s the last defense . Before anything enters the body , 
it &apos;s got a lot of evolution . To suck up impurities , 
and then he added , &quot; But our water doesn &apos;t have impurities . &quot; 
Okay . A farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish . A farm that measures its success in the success of its predators . 
And then I realized when he says , &quot; A farm that doesn &apos;t have impurities , it undermines enormously . &quot; Because the water that flows through this farm comes from the Guadalquivir River . In , 
it &apos;s a river . It &apos;s all the things that carry with it , and rivers nowadays tend to have it with them . Chemical pollutants , outflow of pesticides , 
and if it fights through the system , and it leaves , the water is . Cleaner than it came in , 
the system is so healthy . It cleans the water . 
So not just a farm . They don &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that is successful in the health of their predators . But a farm that is literally a water treatment plant , and not just for these fish , but for you . And me , 
because when the water flows out , it sinks into the Atlantic , 
a drop in the ocean , I know , but I take it , and you should . Because this love story , however romantic it is . It &apos;s also revealing . 
You could say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future . Good food , whether we &apos;re talking about meat or meat cattle , 
what we need now . Is it radically new ? The concept of agriculture , of a food that actually tastes good . 
But for many people , it &apos;s a little too radical . 
We &apos;re not realists . We enjoy . We love lovers . 
We love weekly markets . We love small family farms . We talk about regional food . We eat organic food . 
And if you say that &apos;s the things that are the future of good food . Does anybody stand up somewhere and say , &quot; Hey guys , I love pink . &quot; Flamingos : But how are you going to feed the world ? How 
are you going to feed the world ? 
May I be honest . 
I like this question . Not 
no . Not . Because we &apos;re already producing enough calories . To make the world more than just feed , a 
billion people will . Today , a 
billion are starving , that &apos;s more than ever before . Because of stark inequalities in distribution , not total production . 
Now , I like this question . Not because it &apos;s the logic of our food system that has been going on for the last 50 years . 
Feed grain . Vegetable , pesticides , monocultures , chemicals , the Earth . Chicken @ fish , and all the time , the agricultural industry has just asked . If we feed more people cheaper , how horrible can that be ? That 
was the reason . It was the justification . It was the business plan . American agriculture . 
We should call it . What it is a business in liquidation , a business that quickly takes up ecological capital , which allows precisely that production . 
That &apos;s not a business . And it &apos;s not agriculture . 
Our grain chamber is threatened today . Not because of decreasing . Intake , but because of decreasing resources . 
Not because of the latest mower and tractor inventions , but because of fruitful ones . Country , not by pumps , but by fresh ones . Water , not by chainsaws . It &apos;s by forests . And not by fishing boats . And nets , but by fish in the sea . They 
want to feed the world . 
Let &apos;s start with the question : How are we going to feed ourselves ? 
Or better . How can we create conditions ? Which each community can feed itself to feed that 
to do . Don &apos;t look at the agricultural industrial model for the future . 
It &apos;s really old . And it &apos;s done . 
Capital , chemistry and machines . Stand on top of it . And it never has anything really good to eat . Produced 
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model . 
That &apos;s the one that has two billion years of work experience . Take a look back at Miguel . 
Farmers like Miguel . Farmers like Miguel . 
Farms that don &apos;t have worlds for themselves . Are farms that restore ? Instead of using up farms that grow extensively , instead of just intensive farmers who are not just producers . But experts in relationships . 
Because they are the ones who are experts on taste . 
And if I &apos;m really honest , they &apos;re a better cook . When I ever will be , 
you know , I &apos;m right . Because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious . 
Thank you . 
I grew up with a lot . Portion of science fiction . 
In my school days , I drove by bus . To school , every day , an hour per way . And my 
nose was always in a book . A science fiction book , my thoughts . Absorbing into other worlds and storytelling my deep . Insaturable curiosity in me . Satisfied that curiosity . 
Also , it showed up in it . That whenever I &apos;m not in school , I always , through the woods , strove . Migrated and sampled frogs . And snakes . And beetle And pond water , everything . Brought home and under the microscope , 
I looked at it , I was totally science @-@ thrilled . 
You know , it was always about trying . Understanding the world and understanding the limits of what could be possible , 
and my love of science . Fiction seemed to reflect in my environment , because back in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea . 
Jacques Cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows . They show us animals and places and a world full of wonders . We never would have imagined before 
, and that &apos;s probably what &apos;s good . It &apos;s been a science fiction 
role that I was an artist . 
I could draw , I could paint , 
and because it &apos;s neither video games nor this saturation with computer @-@ generated films , nor the whole visual language . In the media landscape , I had to give the images in my head . 
We all had to do that when we were reading a book as kids , we took the author &apos;s description and projected it . The canvas in our heads 
, my reaction to it . Was drawing and painting ? From alien alien worlds , robots , spacecraft and all of that . In math class , 
I was caught by the teacher all the time . Like me , hidden in the textbook , 
painting around , creativity had to sort of get out . 
And something interesting happened , which is what happened to me , in fact , at Jacques Cousteaus &apos; shows . Was the idea of a world that we were completely unfamiliar with ? Here on our planet , 
I &apos;m sure I would never have an alien world with a spaceship . That seemed pretty unlikely to me . 
But here was a world that I could actually enter . Here on Earth . And it was just as fascinating . And exotic as all that I always imagined . When I read these books , 
so I decided when I was 15 , I was going to become a diver . 
The only problem with this was that I was in a small village in Canada . 1,000 miles from the next ocean . 
Far from that . Let &apos;s go . But I didn &apos;t . Discouraging . 
I annoyed my father . Until he finally got a diving school in Buffalo , New York . Right on the other side of the border where we lived , 
I made my diving certificate in a pool . The YMCA , right in the middle of winter in Buffalo , New York , 
the ocean . But a real ocean I got only two years . Later on , I saw it . When we moved to California , 
since then , in the 40 years that have passed . I have about 3,000 hours underwater . 500 hours of that in submersible boats , 
and I &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flatter oceans , is so rich in fascinating life . Is it really hard to imagine how we think ? Can 
nature &apos;s imagination know ? No limits . Unlike our own miserable . 
Human imagination to this day , I find deepest awe . For what I do on my dives 
and my love of the ocean . Keep on at the same intensity as ever , as 
I then feel as an adult a profession , was . It was filming . 
That seemed the best way to make my inner urge . Tell stories with my need to create images . 
Unify as a child drew . I keep drawing comic books . And so films were 
the way , pictures and stories . Put them together . That fit . 
Together , of course , the stories I chose were the stories . From the science fiction field : Terminator Aliens . And Abyss at Abyss . Could 
I share my love for the underwater world and diving with filmmaking ? 
So , intertwined . So my two passions , 
sort of , are interesting . Did Abyss happen ? To solve a narrative problem in this movie , and that was , we had to create a kind of liquid water system . Let &apos;s grab back computer @-@ generated animation , CG . 
What came out of this was the first computer @-@ generated soft surface figure . The one ever seen in a movie was 
the film , which didn &apos;t bring money . In fact , it just played its production costs . But I noticed something fascinating . The audience around the world was hypnotized . The magic that was thought to 
have been , according to Arthur Clarke &apos;s law , advanced technology is , as you know , advanced . And magic is no longer . 
Different from each other , so you saw something magical . 
And I found that incredibly exciting . 
And I thought , &quot; Wow , that absolutely must be involved in film art . &quot; 
So we went to Terminator . Two more things to my next movie . 
Together with ILM , we created the guy there . We made liquid metal . Success depended entirely on that . How that effect would arrive 
and it worked . Again , we had created something magical . And the effect in the audience was the same , but we already have a little more money in the movie 
, from these two experiences . And starting with this , it was a whole new world . It reached a whole new world . Creativity for filmmakers , 
so I started a company with my good friend Stan Winston , who became one of the companies at the time , the best make @-@ up and creature designer , called Digital Domain . 
The basic idea of this company was to start the phase of analog processes . With optical printers , etc . , skip and go straight to digital productions . 
We did . Then we did , and we did , for a time , get a competitive advantage . 
But in the mid @-@ 1990s , we realized that we were in the Creature and Character Design , which we actually founded the company for . 
We were moving too slowly . I had this piece Avatar . It was written . It was the benchmark for visual effects and computer @-@ generated effects to new heights . It was meant to push with realistic , human expressive characters made using CG . And the main characters were supposed to be all CG . And the world was supposed to be CG . 
But the benchmark pretty much pushed back , and the people in my company told me that for the time being , we &apos;re not yet able to do that . 
So I shifted that , and I made this other movie . About the big ship that goes down 
, the film studio , I used that as Romeo and Juliet on a ship . It became a love movie of epic proportions , a passionate movie . But 
in secret , I actually wanted to become a real wreck . The Titanic , I 
went down , that &apos;s why I made the movie . 
That &apos;s the truth . The studio didn &apos;t know that . I convinced them , 
but I convinced them by saying , &quot; We dive to the wreck . We film . &quot; The real wreck , 
we &apos;ll do it in the opening sequence of the film . 
That &apos;s incredibly important . It &apos;s a good trailer . It &apos;s for marketing , 
and I persuaded them to do an expedition . Funding 
sounds crazy . But that &apos;s okay again . It &apos;s because your imagination creates a reality . 
Can we actually create a reality six months later , where I got to a Russian @-@ diver dive boat ? Four kilometers below the surface of the North Atlantic and me , the real Titanic looked through a bullet . This was 
not a movie . No HD , this was real . 
So , this really blew me around . 
And the preparations for this were enormous . We had to have cameras and headlights and everything . And I noticed 
how much these deep @-@ sea dive gears were . A space mission was like , &quot; Well , 
yeah . They were also high @-@ tech . And they needed extensive planning . 
You get up . You get into that capsule . You float into this dark , hostile environment . You get down where there &apos;s no hope . There &apos;s salvation if you don &apos;t get it back yourself . 
&quot; And I thought , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s the same as if I were in a science fiction movie . 
&quot; That &apos;s really cool . I 
was really obsessed . I was obsessed with exploring the deep sea , at least the part 
that &apos;s related to curiosity and science . Has it been ? It was all . It was adventure . It was curiosity . It was imagination . 
And it was an experience . I don &apos;t have the opportunity to give Hollywood to me , 
because , you know , I could imagine a being for which we then create a visual effect . But I couldn &apos;t imagine what was I outside of the window , but I couldn &apos;t imagine what was happening outside the window . 
Would some of the expeditions that followed me have seen beings in thermal springs ? And sometimes things that I &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that were still not seen before , sometimes things that nobody had ever seen before . And for those who were science at the time we saw them , not a word at all . 
Found . Had that really got me ? Turned it around , and I wanted more , 
and so I met . A little unusual . Decision 
after success . From Titanic , I said , okay . I want my main job . As a filmmaker in Hollywood , I &apos;m going to put on ice for a while , full @-@ time researcher , 
and then we started planning these expeditions . 
We went to Bismarck and we explored them with robotic vehicles , 
we went to the wreck . The Titanic , 
we took small robots . We built them , we ran a fiberglass cable , 
and our intention was to do it . Dive in and dive inside the ship , what never has been done before . 
Nobody had ever had ever explored the inside of the wreck . You had no means yet . So we developed the technology to do that . 
So , well , and I &apos;m sitting on the deck there . The Titanic . In a submersible boat , and I see planks that are quite similar to these boards here . And of those I know once the band was playing there . 
And I &apos;m flying through the band with a little robot vehicle . Of the ship , 
I &apos;m actually only operating it , but my consciousness is inside the vehicle . 
It felt like I was physical . Within the shipwreck of the Titanic , 
there was the surreal form . A déjà vu I &apos;ve ever experienced , because before I was at one corner each , I always knew what was going to be in the vehicle &apos;s cone of light . Because I was walking over the movie set for months . When we shot the film , 
the set was actually an exact copy . The ship &apos;s blueprints , 
so that was a very strange one . 
Experience : She made me aware of this telepresence experience . That you use robotic avatars like this , and so you put your consciousness into the vehicle in this different form . You can move the existence . 
It was really incredibly profound . 
And maybe a little bit of a view . So what might have happened in a few decades ? Could if you have cyborg bodies to explore something ? Or do other things ? In all sorts of post @-@ human future scenarios that I can imagine as a science fiction fan . 
After these expeditions , we started what we saw down there . Really ? Learning to appreciate . For example , these deep sea equals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . These are , like , aliens . But here on Earth . 
They live with chemosynthesis . 
They don &apos;t exist in sunlight . They exist in a system like we do that . 
And so you see animals . They live right next to a 500 degrees Celsius water cloud . And 
you can &apos;t imagine they live there . Can interested people 
at the same time ? I also very much like space science . That was science fiction again . From my childhood , 
and so I ended up with the people who were interested in space . And those who were involved with NASA , and they were in NASA &apos;s expert council planning real space missions . They &apos;re going to Russia . They &apos;re going through before the mission . The biomedical protocol , including , Everything . They &apos;re going to fly to the international . Space Station and take our 3D camera systems with them . 
That was fascinating . 
But in the end , it went on . That I was going to take space scientists with us into the deep sea 
, I took them with me , and I &apos;m going to give them access to the world . Down there , astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme situations . I took them to the sources so they could look around , take samples . And test instruments , and so on . 
We did documentary films , but we actually did science , more specifically space science , 
so the circle closed . Between my existence as a science fiction fan , then as a child , and implementation . 
Reality over the course of this discovery journey , I learned a lot . 
I learned a lot about science . But I also learned a lot about leadership . 
Now , you probably think a director must lead . Can a leader be ? Like a ship captain or something . But 
I didn &apos;t understand much . Of leadership before I started these expeditions , 
because at a certain point , I had to say , &quot; What do I do ? &quot; Actually , here , 
why ? Do I do that ? What &apos;s going on ? Out of these stupid movies , 
we don &apos;t get money . One : We &apos;re 
just playing production costs . One of fame , no trace . 
Everybody thinks I &apos;m between Titanic . And Avatar walked away and somewhere I would have the nails on a towel . I &apos;d been on the beach , 
I &apos;d been celebrating all these movies , these documentary films , for a very small audience . 
Don &apos;t make fame . Don &apos;t honor . Don &apos;t make money . What are you doing ? Only 
you do it . For the sake of the task , for the sake of the challenge , and the ocean is the most challenging environment . There are , you make it of the exploratory noise . Because of and because of the strange connection that emerges when a small group of people form a team . 
Because we have all of this with just 10 to 12 people . They &apos;ve worked together for years , and sometimes we &apos;ve been on sea for two to three months in a row 
and in this community . Do you realize that the most important thing is respect for each other ? Because you &apos;ve done a job . You don &apos;t know how to explain it to anyone else 
when you go back to land . And you say , &quot; We had to do it . &quot; The fiberglass , the sound attenuation , and all around it , the whole technology . And the difficulties , the human performance . When you work at sea , you can just not explain that to others . This is like policemen or soldiers . They &apos;ve gone through something together , and they know they never can explain it to anybody . 
And there &apos;s a connection . There &apos;s mutual respect , 
so when I came back to my next movie , Avatar . I tried to use the same leadership style . That is , you respect your team and in return deserve its respect . 
And that really changed the dynamics . 
So I stood there again . With a small team on unknown terrain , we turned Avatar with a new technology . It &apos;s not been before , 
incredibly exciting . 
It &apos;s a 
tremendous challenge , and we got a four and a half @-@ year period to be a real family . 
And that changed my way of making films . 
It changed completely . There were people who thought we had these ocean properties , yeah , really good . They were imitating them and transporting them to the planet Pandora , and 
for me , it was more of a principled way of doing my job . To do the real process , which changed as a result . 
What can we do from all of this 
, what lessons do we have ? 
We learned . I believe in the first place . 
Is curiosity ? It &apos;s the most powerful human property . Our 
imagination is a force that even creates a reality . Can 
and can respect your team ? More importantly than all the laurels of this world to me . 
Come on young filmmakers who say , &quot; Give me a gift . &quot; A advice like I can do this . And 
I say , &quot; Don &apos;t limit you . &quot; Even 
one that already gets involved . Others for you don &apos;t do it . You bet on yourself . Not against yourself . Take yourself . Risk . On you . 
NASA . Has such a favorite sentence ? Failure . Is not an alternative ? But 
in art and exploration , failure has to be an alternative . Because there it guarantees a trust advance , not 
an important one . Do innovation . Were ever approached without risk , 
you have to be ready to take risks like 
that . That &apos;s the idea . I &apos;d like to share with you the idea that failure is a very alternative . Fear is not a thank you . 
If I can bring you one thing closer today , it &apos;s that the whole data we consume is larger . As the sum of your parts , and instead of thinking about overloading information . I want you to think about that . How do we use information to make patterns emerge ? And we see trends that otherwise are not visible . 
We would have become something we see here . Is a typical death chart ? Ordinated by age , 
the program I &apos;m using here is a little experiment . 
It &apos;s called Pivot . And what I can do with Pivot is that I &apos;m going to filter for a certain cause of death . Can we say accidents , 
and immediately I see another one ? Patterns that emerge , 
because in the middle , here , people are most active . And over here , most frail , 
we can go one step further and sort out the data , then . And see that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects . But not for everyone , 
if we go on and sort by age , we say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are even the main cause . The people worry about should be , 
and who &apos;s looking at them . That &apos;s particularly true for men . 
So you realize that the reputation of information and data in this way is very much swimming . In a vivid information graph , 
and if we do this for raw data , why not for content itself ? 
So what we have here is the cover images of each individual . Sports Illustrated , which have ever been printed . 
It &apos;s all here . It &apos;s all online . 
You can like it after I gave my talk in your rooms . 
With Pivot , you can dive in . In a decade , 
you can dive in a given year , 
you can dive directly to a particular issue . 
Now , if I look here , I see the athletes who are out in this issue . And the sports , 
I &apos;m a lance . Armstrong . Fan : So I click here . What makes all the issues that Lance Armstrong mentions to me ? Now 
, if I get a bigger overview . I want to think , OK ? What if I could get all about cycling ? So 
I take a step back . And I expand the perspective . 
Now I see Greg Lemon , 
and so you get an idea . That if you look at information in this way , you zoom out more targeted , wider , more pure , you don &apos;t look for it . Or you don &apos;t surf . Just 
you . You do something that &apos;s actually a little different . 
It &apos;s something in between . And we think it changes the way in which information is used . 
Can I now want to take this idea a little bit further ? With about something a little crazy . 
What we &apos;ve done here is we have every single wikipedia page taken and put it on a little summary . 
The summary contains a short overview . And a symbol of the range . It comes from . 
I &apos;ll just show you the top 500 of the most popular . Wikipedia pages , 
but even in this narrow view , we can do a lot of things . 
We get an instant impression of the issues . The ones that are most popular on Wikipedia , 
I &apos;m going to vote on the issue of government . 
Now , after I &apos;ve elected government , I realize that the categories of Wikipedia that are most consistent with it . Time Magazines : People of the Year . 
Are these really important ? Because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single Wikipedia page . 
This is only to be seen . If you go one step back and look at the whole thing , 
looking at one of these summaries . Can I then go into the subject of Time ? Magazines , People of the Year , and see everybody together ? Now 
, if I look at all these people , I realize that the majority of them are government officials . Some come from science . Some come from economics , some come from economics . Here &apos;s my boss . And one comes from music , 
and interestingly , Bono . Also , a TED Prize . 
Winners : So we can jump now and take a look at all the TED Prize . 
Winners throw , you see , we surf . On the net , for the first time , as if it &apos;s really a net . Not only from side to side , but much more abstract . 
And so I want to show you something else . What a little surprise might be , I &apos;ll show you . 
Just show you the New York . Times &apos; website 
Pivot : This application . I don &apos;t want to call it a browser . It &apos;s really not a browser . But you can look at websites with it . And we bring this zoom technology to every single website . Like this , 
so I can take a step back . And right to a specific section , 
jump , and that &apos;s important because you can only go through looking at websites of this kind . All the Internet history in the same way can be looked at . 
So I can zoom in into my course , in a certain time frame 
, and here &apos;s the state of play . The whole demonstration that I &apos;ve been holding up to this point , 
and I can sort of see everything I &apos;ve been looking at today . 
I can get back . And if I go out again and go back and look at everything . I can rearrange my course . Maybe after my search past here , I &apos;ve been looking for nepotistic . Here &apos;s Bing , or here &apos;s live Labs Pivot , 
and from here , I can go into the page . And call it again . 
It &apos;s a metaphor . It &apos;s used over and over again , and every time it does that . Overall picture bigger . As the sum of the data pieces 
in this world right now think . We think data is a curse . 
We talk about the curse of the abundance of information , 
we talk about drowning in information . 
What if we could turn this situation around ? And the Internet upside down so that we , instead of always being from one to the other , start . From many things to many things . Being able to see patterns that otherwise remain hidden . 
If we can do this , then this hitherto data trap may be a new source of meaning . 
Information , and instead of just getting information . To move around , we can get knowledge from it . 
And if we know , then maybe we can even learn wisdom from it . 
So I stop . Thank you very much . 
Everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today . 
I have some people , the number of books counts . Let those with happiness in the title in the last five years have been published . And they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more . 
There &apos;s a huge wave of interest . Happiness among researchers . 
There &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching . 
Everybody would like to make people happier . 
But despite all this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps . They &apos;re making it almost impossible , so to speak , to think clearly about happiness , 
and my talk today is going to be . And mostly these cognitive traps are going to be acting . 
That &apos;s true for laymen who are thinking about their own happiness . And it &apos;s true for scientists who are thinking about happiness because it turns out we &apos;re just as confused . Like everybody else , 
the first of these traps is a reluctance to complexity . 
It turns out that the word happiness is simply not a useful word anymore . Because we put it on too many different things . 
I think there &apos;s a certain meaning on which we limit it . But could , by and large , that be something we give up ? We need to give up , and we will take the complicated view . Do we need to take what well @-@ being is ? 
The second case is a confusion of experience . And memory , basically , is between happiness . In his life , and being happy about his life , or happy . With his life , 
and these are two very different concepts . And they &apos;re both thrown together . In the notion of happiness , 
and the third is the concentration illusion . And that &apos;s the unfortunate fact . That we don &apos;t have a way to think about one thing . Well @-@ being affects without its meaning . To distort , 
I mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive trap . 
There &apos;s just no way . It &apos;s right . 
To get there . Well , I &apos;d like to start with an example . Someone who had a question and answer session after one of my lectures , who reported a story , was unclear , he said he &apos;d heard a symphony . And it was absolutely magnificent . ( Music ) And at the very end of the recording , there was a terrible one . ( Creating sound ) 
And then he added , &quot; Really ? Pretty emotional . &quot; This has all the experience . Ruined , 
but it didn &apos;t . 
What it ruined was the memories of the experience . 
It had the experience . 
It had 20 minutes more glorious . 
( Music ) It didn &apos;t count . Because it stayed with a memory . The memory was ruined . And the memory was everything he kept getting . What did 
that really tell us ? Is that we were talking about ourselves and about other people ? Could we think about two kinds of 
self ? There &apos;s an enlivening self that is present in the present . And the present knows is capable of rebuilding the past . But basically , only the present . Is 
it the living self ? That the doctor is acclaimed . You know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Is it doing it now ? &quot; &quot; Woe if I touch you here , 
and then there &apos;s a remembering self . &quot; And the remembering self is that which is mitzählt . And the story of our life keeps up , and it &apos;s the one the doctor is addressing . By asking the question , &quot; How did you feel lately ? &quot; 
Or , &quot; How was your journey ? &quot; To Albania or something . Similar . 
These are two very different units . The living self and the remembering self and the two are confusing are part of the way in which they go . The term happiness . 
Now , the remembering self . Is a storyteller ? 
And that really starts with a fundamental reaction . It starts with our memories . It starts immediately . 
We &apos;re not just telling stories when we get to it . Telling stories , telling 
our memory . Tales tell us stories . That means what we keep from our experiences is a story . 
And let &apos;s just start with an example . 
There &apos;s an old study . 
These are real patients who are going to undergo a painful procedure . 
I &apos;m not going to go into detail . It &apos;s no longer painful today . But it was painful . When this study was done in the 1990s , 
they were asked to go on pain every 60 seconds . And 
here are two patients . These are their records . 
And they &apos;re asked , who of both suffered more ? And 
this is a very simple question . 
Patient B has clearly suffered more . His intestinal reflection was longer and every minute of pain , the patient had A . Patient B and more , 
but now there &apos;s another question . How much did these patients think ? That they suffered , 
and here &apos;s a surprise . And 
the surprise is that patient A is a much worse reminder of intestinal reflection . When patient B was 
the stories of intestinal reflections , different , and because a very critical part of the story is . How it ends , 
and none of these stories is very edible . Or great , but one of them is clear , but one of them is clear . Worse than the other , 
and worse than the other , was where pain was at the very end of its peak . It &apos;s a bad story . 
How do we know that ? 
Because we &apos;re going to ask these people about their gut reflection . And much later . How bad was the whole thing ? Overall , 
and it was much worse . For A than for B in memory , 
well , this is a direct conflict . Between the living self and the remembering self , 
from the perspective of the living . Even B clearly had a worse time . 
Now , what you could do with patient A , and we actually did clinical experiments . And it &apos;s done . It &apos;s been done . And it works . You could actually use the intestinal imaging of patient A by just extending the tube in . Without too much shake on it , 
that will lead to that . The patient &apos;s suffering , but only a little bit less than before . 
And if you do that for a few minutes , you &apos;ve done it . That the living self of patient A is worse off . And you &apos;ve made the memory self of patient A much better off than that . Because now you have patient A better story about your experience . 
What does a story look like ? 
And that &apos;s true of the stories . The memory that gives us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories . The stories that we invent , which 
make a story unique . Are upheavals ? Significant moments and ends . 
Ends . Very , very important . And in this case , the end 
now dominated the living self . Its life continuous , 
it has moments of experience . One after the other , 
and you ask , what happens to these moments ? 
And the answer is really simple . They &apos;re lost forever . 
I mean , most moments of our lives , and I &apos;ve done this all the time . You know , the psychological presence . It &apos;s about three seconds . Long , what does knowledge mean ? Do you know that in a life there are about 600 million of them ? In a month , there are about 600,000 , most of them left behind . No trace , 
most of them . They &apos;re completely ignored . They &apos;re completely ignored by the memory self , 
and yet they kind of get the impression . They should count . That what happens during these moments of experience , our lives , is . 
It &apos;s the limited resource we consume . While we &apos;re in this world 
and how we consume it . Would it seem important ? But that &apos;s not the story . The memory self keeps us in , 
so we have the memory . Even the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different . 
The biggest difference between them is how to deal with time . 
From the perspective of the living self . If you have a vacation and the second week is just as good . Is like the first , then the two @-@ week one . Holiday twice as good as the one @-@ week one . Holiday , 
that &apos;s how it works . Not at all . For the memorative self , 
for the memorative self , a two @-@ week holiday . Hardly better than the one @-@ week holiday , because there are no new memories added . 
You don &apos;t change the story . 
And that &apos;s how time is actually the critical variable . The one remembering self is different from a living self , time . It has very little influence . Now , on this story 
, the remembering self , makes more than remembering . And telling stories , 
it &apos;s actually the one . The decisions are made , because if you have a patient who , let &apos;s say , has two intestinal reflections with two different surgeons . And it decided which one to choose . If that &apos;s the one to choose . The one who has the memory that &apos;s less bad . And that &apos;s the surgeon who &apos;s chosen . Will 
the living self have ? No voice . In this election , actually , 
we don &apos;t vote . Between experiences , we choose between memories of experiences . 
And even if we think about the future , we think about our future . Normally not as experiences , 
we think about our future . After , as anticipated memories , 
and basically , you can look at that . You know , as a tyranny of the memory self , and you can think of the memory self . As one , which is the living self , so to speak . Put through experience . The living self . Not needed . 
I have the impression that if we go on vacation , very often it &apos;s the case , that is , . We go on vacation as far as possible . We go on vacation at the service of the memory self , 
and that &apos;s a little bit hard . To justify , I think 
I mean , how much do we feed from our memories ? 
That &apos;s one of the explanations that explains the dominance of the memory self . 
And when I think about that , I think about a vacation that we spent a few years ago in Antarctica , in Antarctica . It &apos;s clearly the best vacation I &apos;ve ever had . And I think about it relatively often relative to how often I think about other vacations 
and I have probably been talking about my memories of these three @-@ week trips . I would say , for about 25 minutes . In the last four years , I &apos;ve been dragged . 
Well , if I &apos;d ever opened the folder with the 600 images in it , I &apos;d spent another hour . 
Well , that &apos;s three weeks . And that &apos;s at most one and a half hours , it seems . 
It seems to be disagreement . 
Well , I like to be a little extreme . You know , in that , how little appetite I have for feeding ? But of memories , even if you do more of them , there &apos;s a real question . Why do we give memories ? So much weight in the lurch . On the weight we give experiences , 
so I want you to talk about a thought experiment . 
Imagine your next vacation , you know that on the end of the vacation , all your images are destroyed . And you get an amnesty drug so you get nothing to remember , you don &apos;t remember . 
Now you would choose the same vacation . And if you choose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict . Between your two kinds of self , and you have to think about it . How you decide this conflict , and that &apos;s really even . Not obvious , because if you want to think about time , you get an answer . And if you want to think about memories , you could get a different answer . 
Why ? We choose vacations . The one we choose is a problem . That confronts us with a choice between the two species . 
The self , well , the two kinds of self , throw two terms . From happiness , 
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply . One per self , 
so you can ask , how happy is the living ? 
Even then , you would ask , how happy are the moments in life ? The living self , 
and you are all happiness . For moments , it &apos;s a pretty complicated one . 
Process : What are the emotions ? Which can be measured . 
And by the way , we &apos;re now able to have a pretty good idea . Getting from the happiness of the living self over time , 
when you &apos;re lucky after the happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a very different thing . 
This is not about it . How happy a person lives it ? Is 
it about how satisfied or happy ? The person is when this person is thinking about his life , 
very different terms , 
each person who doesn &apos;t distinguish these terms . Will research into happiness melt up ? And I &apos;m a lot of researchers about well @-@ being . Those who have long masked research into happiness . Have they the very way to 
distinguish between happiness of the living self and happiness of the remembering self ? Has it been recognized in recent years , and now you &apos;re trying to separate the two ? To measure , 
the Gallup Organization has conducted a global survey , in which more than half a million people . Questions asked . Have they been asked ? Have they been asked about what they are about their lives ? Think about their experiences ? And there have been other efforts in the direction of 
that . So we &apos;ve started to think about the happiness of the two kinds of self . 
And the main lesson we &apos;ve learned , I think , is that they &apos;re really different . 
You can know how satisfied someone with their lives is . And that really teaches you . Not much about it . How happy he is . Life lives , and vice versa . 
Just to give you an idea of correlation . Correlation is about five percent 
, which means that . Is that if you met someone and you would be told , &quot; Oh , his father is a two @-@ meter man . How much would you know about his size ? 
&quot; Well , you would know something about his size . But there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty . 
You have so much uncertainty . 
When I tell you that someone has his life as eight on a scale of 10 . You have a lot of uncertainty . How happy he is . With his own living self . 
So the correlation is low . 
We know something about it . What happiness itself determines , 
we know that money is very important . Targets are very important . 
We know happiness means mostly . Satisfied . Being with people we like , time to spend , with people we like , 
there &apos;s other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant when 
you &apos;re in the happiness of happiness of the two kinds of self . If you want to , you &apos;re going to do very different things in the end . So 
the conclusion from what I &apos;ve said here is that we &apos;re really not imagining happiness , really . As a substitute for well @-@ being , 
it &apos;s a completely different term . 
Now , very briefly , another reason why we don &apos;t know how to think about happiness . Can &apos;t we think about the same things ? If we think about life , and if we actually live , 
so if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California . Are they not going to be the correct answer ? Are they going to get the right answer if 
they ask that question ? Do they think that people in California need to be happier ? If they say , &quot; We live in Ohio 
and what happened ? &quot; That if they talk about life in California , think about life difference . Between California and other places , and that difference is , say , climate . 
Well , it turns out climate isn &apos;t very important to the living self . And it &apos;s not even very important . For the thoughtful self , that decides how happy people are , 
well , because the thoughtful self is responsible . Can you end up with some people ? End up moving to California , 
and it &apos;s kind of interesting . Tracking what happens to people . They go to California hoping to be happier . 
Now , their living self won &apos;t get happier . 
We know that , 
but one thing will happen . You &apos;ll think you &apos;re happier . Because if you think about it , you &apos;re reminded of it . How terrible the weather in Ohio was . And you &apos;ll feel you &apos;re making the right decision . 
It &apos;s very difficult to think clearly about well @-@ being . And I hope I have an impression of that . How difficult it is . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question . 
Thank you very much . 
Well , when we telephoned a couple of weeks ago , you told me that it was a pretty interesting result . This from this Gallup survey 
is something that you told us you were participating in . You can let it happen because you now have a few minutes left . 
Daniel Kahneman : Surely . 
I think the most interesting result . The one we found in the Gallup survey . It &apos;s a number that we absolutely cannot find . 
We expected it to be in terms of happiness for the survivor , even 
if we looked at how feelings interact with income , 
and it &apos;s the most interesting finding that among a income of 60 percent , 000 dollars a year , for Americans . And that &apos;s a very big sample . Of Americans , about 600 thousand , but it &apos;s a big representative sample . Under an income of 600 000 dollars a year , 
about 60 000 . 
DK : 60 000 
, 60 000 dollars a year , people are unhappy . And they &apos;re getting increasingly unhappy . The poorer they get 
, we get an absolutely flat line about it . 
I mean , I rarely have such flat lines . 
See what happens ? Is it obvious that money doesn &apos;t bring you experience happiness , but that lack of money certainly brings you misery , and we can make this misery very , very clear . 
In the sense of the other , even the remembering self , you get a different story . 
The more money you make , the more satisfied you are . 
Isn &apos;t it for emotions ? 
CA : But Danny , throughout the American endeavor , it &apos;s about life . Freedom , the aspiration for happiness . 
When people take this finding seriously , I think it all seems to be upside down . To put everything we believe , for example , in tax policy and so on . 
Is there an opportunity for politicians to see that the country generally has a finding like the seriousness ? And based on that , politics would do 
DK , you know , I think there &apos;s recognition . For the role of gambling research in politics , 
recognition will be . Slowly , in the United States , there &apos;s no question , but in the United Kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now . And in other countries , it &apos;s happening . 
People are recognizing it . They &apos;re supposed to think about happiness . If you think about politics , 
it &apos;s going to take a while . And people will discuss whether to explore experience happiness . Or whether to explore life assessment . So we need to have this discussion pretty soon . 
How to increase happiness varies widely . Depending on how you think and whether you think about the memory self . Or whether you think about the living self . 
That will affect politics . Do I think in the coming years 
in the United States , you &apos;re tightening on the experience happiness of the population . 
Measuring that , I think , will be one or two decades or two part of the national statistics . 
His CA : Well , it seems to me that this topic is , or should be , at least the most interesting political debate to follow . Over the next few years , 
thank you very much . For the invention of behavioral economics , 
thank you , Danny Kahneman . Today 
I &apos;m going to talk to you . About energy and climate , 
and that might surprise you a little bit , because my full @-@ time work at the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds . It &apos;s about the things we invent and deliver . It &apos;s about the poorest two billion to make a better life possible . 
But energy and climate are extremely important . For these people , in fact , more important than for everyone . For others on the planet , 
climate degradation means that their seeds don &apos;t grow for many years . It means we &apos;re raining too much or too little . Things will change that way . As your fragile environment does . Not sustainable . 
Can that lead ? To starvation , it leads to insecurity . It leads to unrest . 
So climate change is getting terrible . For you 
, too , the energy price is for you . Very important . 
The fact is , if you &apos;re talking about just one thing , you could reduce the price , you &apos;d be poverty reduction . Energy by far the most effective . 
Well , the energy price has fallen over time . 
In fact , the progress society is based on energy advances that drove 
coal evolution . The industrial revolution , and even in the twentieth century , there was a rapid fall in the electricity price , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators . Air conditioning : We can make modern materials . And so many things we 
do , so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation . With electricity in the rich world , 
but if we let the price down , we let the price halve . Let &apos;s hit a new barrier , and this barrier is related to CO2 . 
CO2 warms the planet and the equation for CO2 is actually pretty clear . 
They sum up the CO2 emitted . Which one to increase temperature ? And this increase in temperature has some very negative consequences . Effects on the weather . And maybe worse , the indirect consequence is that natural ecosystems are undergoing such rapid change . Can and can whole systems collapse ? Well 
, the exact link between a CO2 increase and the resulting temperature change , and where its further consequences lie . There are some ambiguities . But not very many . 
And there &apos;s certainly uncertainty about how bad these consequences will be . But they will be extremely bad . 
I &apos;ve asked the top scientists several times , &quot; Do we really have to get down to near zero ? 
&quot; &quot; Not enough . &quot; Half or a quarter . 
&quot; The answer is , &quot; Until we get near zero . &quot; Will the temperature keep going ? Will it rise ? 
So it &apos;s a big challenge . 
It &apos;s quite different . When we say , &quot; We have a 3.5 @-@ meter truck . &quot; The one below a three @-@ meter bridge . It &apos;s got to come , you can sort of get it below . You 
squeeze it , you have to squeeze it down to zero . 
Well , we hit every year . A lot of carbon dioxide . Over 26 billion tons of 
every American , about 20 tons . People from poor countries , less than one on average , 
it &apos;s about five tons . For everyone on the planet , 
and somehow we have to make changes . They have to reduce that to zero . 
It &apos;s constant . Just increased , 
just different economic . Change has actually affected it . And we have to move from rapid growth to reduction . And to a reduction to zero , 
this equation has . Four factors : A little multiplication . You have this thing on the left , CO2 . You bring it to zero , and that &apos;s going to be determined by the number of people . The services that every human being uses on average . The average energy for every service and the CO2 per unit of energy is emitted . 
So let &apos;s take every factor individually . Let &apos;s look at and think about how we get that to zero . 
One of these numbers probably has to get very close to zero . 
Now , this is basic algebra . But let &apos;s go through it . 
First of all , we have the population living 
today . 6.8 billion people , 
and it &apos;s going to go to 9 billion . 
To those who are moving to 9 billion , if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , healthcare and reproductive medicine , we might well be 10 to 15 percent lower that . But right now we &apos;re seeing a 1.3 percent rise , 
the second factor . Are the services we use ? 
That includes all the food we eat . Clothing , television , heating . 
These are very good things . And poverty reduction means these services to almost everyone on the planet . 
Making them accessible . It &apos;s great . That this number is rising 
in the rich world , in the top billion . Could we possibly make cuts ? And use less , but on average , this number is going to rise every year . And so overall , more than double the number of services per person provided . 
Here we see a very basic service . Is there at home ? Light to read the homework . Can 
and these students don &apos;t ? So they go out and read their homework . Under the street light , 
now in effectiveness , the E , which gives the energy per service . It &apos;s good news at last . 
We have something that doesn &apos;t go up . 
Because of different successes in the lighting sector , by other types of cars , by new methods . In housing , there are many services whose energy use they dramatically reduce . Can they go down dramatically ? Can they go down ? 103.00 . 
05 : 50 . 000 . GT : 00 : 05 : 53 : 000 . Some services can be reduced by 90 % . 
Some services can be reduced by 90 % . Other services , such as fertilisers ( 105 : 00 - 05 ) 56 : 000 GT : 00 - 05 : 58 000 or Air transport Or Air transport Is the room for improvement ? Very much smaller . 
Overall , if we are optimistic , we may get a reduction . By a factor of three , or maybe even a factor of six . 
But for the first three factors , we &apos;re now from 26 billion to perhaps the very best . 13 billion tons went . And that &apos;s just enough . Not enough . 
So let &apos;s look at the fourth factor . And this is going to be a key factor . That &apos;s the amount of CO2 . The CO2 emitted per unit of energy is 
it . The question is whether you get that to zero . 
If you burn coal , no , 
if you burn natural gas , no . 
Almost every method of making electricity . Today , CO2 emits , except renewable energy and nuclear energy , 
so what we do on a global scale . Must a new system be 
created ? We need energy under 
, if I use the term &quot; miracle . &quot; I don &apos;t mean the impossible , 
the microprocessor . Is a miracle ? The PC is a miracle . 
The Internet and its services are a miracle 
, and people here have . And to develop many of these miracles , 
usually there is no deadline . That you can do a miracle by a certain date . 
Normally , you &apos;re just standing by . And some don &apos;t come . In 
this case , we have to give full gas . And a miracle in a very short time . 
Get , well , I wondered , how can I really get this over ? 
Is there a natural illustration , a demonstration ? Which is the idea of the people here , 
I remembered last year . When I brought mosquitos , and somehow people liked this , 
which became the idea . Really tangible to them , you know , there are people . They live with mosquitos for 
energy fell . I got this one . 
I decided that releasing fireflies was my contribution this year to the environment . 
So if there were some natural fireflies here . 
I was assured they didn &apos;t bite . In fact , they probably won &apos;t even leave the glass . 
Well , there are all kinds of game solutions like this , but they don &apos;t bring much . We do . 
Do you need solutions , either one or more , that make an unimaginable scale ? And unimaginable reliability , and though there are many directions where people are looking for it . I really see only five that are making these big demands . Can 
I have tides ? Geothermal fusion . And biofuels omitted . 
These may make a moderate contribution , and if they do better than I expect , that would be great . But my key message here is that we are working on all those five . And we can &apos;t give up any of them . Because they intimidate us , because everybody has significant problems . 
Let &apos;s first look at burning fossil fuels . Fuel burning . From either coal or natural gas , 
what you have to do there seems to be . Maybe just . But that &apos;s it . Not you have to have all that CO2 . That after burning from the chimney comes in . Liquid under pressure and then store somewhere . And hope it stays there . 
There are some pilot projects that will do that at a 60 / 80 level . But it &apos;s getting to 100 . It &apos;s going to be very difficult . And an agreement on the storage of CO2 is a big deal of a challenge . But the biggest problem here is the storage time question : Who 
&apos;s going to do it ? 
Ensure . Who can guarantee something ? What literally is many billion times bigger . As any kind of waste you get from nuclear and other things you 
imagine . Can that be a lot of volume ? 
So this is a hard nut . 
Next , nuclear energy . 
It also has three big ones . Problems : The cost , especially in highly regulated countries , is high . The question of security is that you really feel that nothing goes wrong . Can , despite human cooperation , that the fuel is not used for weapons ? 
And what do you do then ? With the 
garbage , because although it &apos;s not very big . Is there a lot of concern ? People have 
to feel good about it . 
184,00 10 20 000 GT 00 10 25 000 , three very difficult ones . Problems that might be solvable , three very difficult ones . They may be solvable and they may work on them . 
The last three of the five I summarized : It &apos;s 
renewable energy . As you &apos;re often called , 
and they have , even though it &apos;s great . They don &apos;t need fuel . They have some disadvantages . 
One is the energy density that these technologies generate . Dramatically lower than the power plants , 
these are low @-@ energy — you talk about many square kilometers , thousands of times . More space than a normal power plant . 
And these sources are also subject to interruptions . 
The sun doesn &apos;t shine all day long , it doesn &apos;t shine every day , and the wind blows the same way . Not all the time . 
So if you &apos;re going to depend on these sources , you have to have a way to keep energy in times when it &apos;s not available . 
There &apos;s a lot of price challenges here , there &apos;s challenges in transmission , for example , when we say that the energy source is outside the country . Don &apos;t you need it ? Just technology . You also need to deal with the risk . That the energy comes from where it 
comes from , and there &apos;s the storage problem and the dimension . 
So to show you , I &apos;ve got all kinds of batteries that are made . I &apos;ve looked at those for cars , computers . Mobile phones , flashlights for everything . And I &apos;ve got that with the amount of electronic energy that the world uses , compared to what I found . It turns out that all the batteries that we &apos;re now producing . Less than 10 minutes of total energy storage 
, so we need a big breakthrough here . Something that takes a factor of 100 will be better . So , when the approaches at the moment — 
that &apos;s not impossible . But it &apos;s not that easy . 
That happens when you try to get these interrupted sources to , say , 20 @-@ 30 percent of consumption . When they get 
100 percent based on that , they need an incredible wonder battery . 
Now , where are we going ? What &apos;s the right approach ? 
A Manhattan project : How do we get to the finish ? 
What we need is a lot of companies working on it , hundreds of people 
in each of these five areas . We need at least 100 people , 
many of whom will say they &apos;re crazy . That &apos;s good . 
I think here in the TED group there are many who are already engaged . 
Bill Gross has several companies , including one called Esolar , which has great solar thermal technologies . 
Vinod Khosla is investing . Dozens of companies doing great things and interesting opportunities . And I &apos;m trying to support that . 
Nathan Myhrvold and I are funding a company . Maybe surprisingly , it &apos;s pursuing the nuclear approach , 
there are some innovations in the nuclear field modular . 
Liquid , the development in this industry some time ago stopped . So it &apos;s not a big surprise . It &apos;s a lot of good concepts lying around , which means the Terrapower concept . 
It &apos;s that instead of a part of the uranium , the one percent , the U235 , we decided to burn the 99 . The U238 , that 
&apos;s a pretty crazy one . 
Idea , but actually , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time . But you could never simulate it sensibly . Whether it would work , but since there are modern supercomputers , you can simulate it . And you can see that , yes , with the right approach to matter , it looks like this . That it 
works , and because you burn these 99 , the cost profile is much better . In fact , 
you burn the garbage , and you can even burn the garbage from today &apos;s reactors as 
a drive . Instead of turning your head apart , they just burn it . A great thing : 
Uranium is gradually becoming . Consumes a little bit like a candle . 
You can see that it &apos;s a kind of column . It &apos;s often called a wandering wave reactor 
, which really solves the fuel problem . 
Here &apos;s a picture of a place in Kentucky . 
This is the waste . The 99 , you have the part that &apos;s burned today . It &apos;s taken out , so it &apos;s called &quot; depleted uranium . 
&quot; That &apos;s what drives the U.S. for hundreds of years . 
And if you buy ocean water cheap and easy to filter , you get enough fuel for the rest . Life of the planet 
, you know , there are many challenges there , but it &apos;s an example . Of many hundreds of concepts that we need . To move forward , 
we &apos;re thinking about how to measure our success 
. Should our testimony look like ? 
Well , we go to the goal that we need to achieve . And then we talk about the intermediate step . 
Many talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 . 
It &apos;s really , really important . That we get there , 
the remaining 20 percent is produced in poor countries . Are there still some agriculture ? Hopefully , forest threats and cement will happen by then . Be clean , 
so to reach that 80 percent . Do the developed world , including countries like China , have to completely transform their generation of electricity 
? The other note says , do we use zero emissions technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries ? And we &apos;re on the way to the rest . Getting 
that . That &apos;s great . Important . 
That &apos;s going to be a key element of this stuff . 
If we go back from there , how should that look like 2020 ? 
It should be back in the two elements . 
We should use the effectiveness measures to get reduction going . The less we emit , the lower the amount of CO2 will be . And so the temperature , 
but actually , this note is for the things we do , the things that are not completely going to lead to the big reductions . Just equal , right ? Even something . Less important . Like the other . Which one ? Speed ? Innovation ? For these breakthroughs ? 
Is this breakthroughs ? Do we have to track with full gas ? And we can measure that . In company numbers , in pilot projects and regulatory changes , 
there are lots of great books . On this subject 
, Al Gore &apos;s book , we have the choice , and David McKay &apos;s Sustainable . Energy without the Hot Air , you 
really do . You go through and create a framework . In which this can be widely discussed , because we need support for it . From all sides , 
there &apos;s a lot that comes together . 
Must that be a wish ? 
Very concrete . Wish that we invent this technology 
if you just want me a wish for the next 50 years . I could choose the president , a vaccine , and I love that . Or I could choose that wish . That &apos;s half the energy price . Without CO2 , it &apos;s invented . That &apos;s what I would like to 
see . This one has the greatest impact 
if we don &apos;t get that wish . Will the gap between long @-@ term and short @-@ term thinking ? People get terrible between the United States and China . Between poor and rich countries , and almost all live on these two . Billions get much worse . 
So what do we need to do ? 
What action do I appeal for ? 
We need to work for more research funding . 
If countries are in places like Koppenhagen , they should not just be talking about CO2 . 
They should be discussing this innovation strategy . And they would be shocked . Of the ridiculously low money that is being spent on these innovative approaches . 
We need market incentives , carbon taxes . Cap &amp; amp ; Trade , something that sends a price signal . 
We need to spread the message . 
We need dialogue , rationality and completeness . And the things that the government is doing 
, too , is an important desire , but I think we can do it . 
Thank you very much . 
Thank you very much . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . Thank you . 
Thank you very much . Just to make Terrapower a little better . First of all , you can give us an idea of the scale of this investment . 
Bill Gates : To simulate on a supercomputer , all the big scientists . To get what we &apos;ve done , we just need a few 10 million , and even a few million . If we put our materials to a Russian reactor to make sure it &apos;s working properly . Is it only in the 100s ? Millions , 
the difficult step is building . The first reactor is to find billions more , the regulations and the place that &apos;s actually building the first of them . 
Once the first is finished , when it &apos;s running as promised . Then everything is clear . Because the profitability , the energy density , is so different . As with nuclear energy , as we know it , 
CA : To understand that correctly . That means deep into the ground . Almost like a vertical . Pillar of nuclear fuel , that used . Urans , and then the process begins . Up there , and continues to work . Down there . 
BG : Exactly today , you have to refill the reactor . So there are lots of people and lots of controls that go wrong . Can this thing where you open it ? And things in there ? Or bring out ? That &apos;s not good . 
But if you have very cheap fuel , you can refill it for 60 years . Think of a column that you bury . Without all the complexities , 
and it sits there and burns . For 60 years , and then it &apos;s done . 
CA : A nuclear reactor . The self @-@ solution for the garbage . 
BG : Yeah . Well , what happens to the garbage ? You can sit it . There &apos;s much less garbage . So with this method , you take it and grab it . In the next reactor , you burn it further . 
And we start by taking the garbage . It already exists , which is in these refrigerators or dry tanks at the reactors . That &apos;s our starting fuel . So what is 
that for these reactors was a problem ? What we do in our fill , and that &apos;s dramatically reducing the volume of garbage . Reduced during this process , 
about , but while you &apos;re with different people in the world talking about these possibilities . 
Where is the biggest ? Interest ? This is really what ? Transposition . 
BG : Well , we haven &apos;t yet set ourselves in a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting . Disclosure rules for everything that nuclear carries in the name , there &apos;s a lot of interest , and the people of the company were in Russia , India . China : I was here and I met the energy minister . And I talked about how this fits into the energy agenda . 
I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the French and the Japanese have made something in the direction . 
This is a variant . One thing that was done . 
Was this an important step ? Forward , but it &apos;s like a quick one . Reactor and some countries have built this , so anyone who &apos;s building a quick reactor is there . Has a candidature for our first CA in your imagination 
, timeframe ? And probability , really , this is what ? To start life . 
BG : Well , we need one of these scalable . Power generating things that are very cheap . We &apos;ve got 20 years to invent . And then 20 years to insert , 
which is kind of the deadline that environmental models have shown us . We have to keep to 
that , and you know Terrapower , if it &apos;s going well . And that &apos;s a big wish . Could that keep 
it easy ? And fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds that , if their approaches work , work the same way . Promoting their pilots works for that , can offer it , 
and it would be best if several could do it , because then you could use a mix , and definitely you need it . 
We need a solution . 
CA : So , with regard to the big , possible breakthroughs , this is the biggest one . You know , 
BG : An energy break is the most important one . 
That &apos;s it . Without the environmental challenge . But it &apos;s still power . So much more important 
in the nuclear sector . Are there other innovative companies 
? You know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as they do ? But there &apos;s the modular method . That &apos;s a different approach . 
There &apos;s a liquid reactor type that seems a little difficult . But maybe they say that about us , 
and so there are different , but the beauty of that is that a uranium molecule is millions of times as much energy . Like a carbon molecule , let &apos;s say , and that &apos;s why , if you can deal with the problems , and they &apos;re mainly radiation . The footprint and the cost is that . So potential , the impact on the land . And other things , almost . In a league of its own , 
CA : If that doesn &apos;t work , what ? 
Then we have to take emergency action . To try to stabilize the Earth &apos;s temperature . 
BG : If you get into this situation , it &apos;s as if you eat too much . And just before a heart attack , what do you do ? You might need a heart surgery or something like that . 
There &apos;s a research that &apos;s called geoengineering . It &apos;s about different techniques to deal with the delay in warming . So that we can get 20 or 30 years longer to get together 
, which is just an insurance method . 
You hope we don &apos;t need that . 
Some people say you shouldn &apos;t be at insurance first . Because you might be lazy . So you eat further , because you know that you &apos;re going to save your heart surgery . 
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart . If you look at the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering . Whether you can have that at your disposal . Should things get faster ? Or this innovation ? It takes longer than we expect . 
About climate skeptics have one or two sentences for them , which might convince you . 
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps . 
Those who make scientific arguments are very little . 
Tell them that there are negative impacts . Those with clouds have to do with things moving . There 
are very , very few things they can say at all . Of those , there &apos;s a chance in a million , 
the main problem here is so similar . As with AIDS , 
you make the mistake . Now , and you pay a lot for it . Later , 
and that &apos;s why the idea is , now , if you have all sorts of urgent problems . Investing in something you &apos;re going to do later , what do you have and what comes to that ? That the investment is not so clear . In fact , the IPCC Report is not necessarily the worst scenario . And there are people in the rich world . They look at IPCC and say , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s not a big one . Drama , 
the fact is that this uncertainty is worrying us . But should 
my dream here be that if you make it economically and at the same time eliminate CO2 ? &quot; Then the skeptics say , &quot; Okay . &quot; I &apos;m not interested . It &apos;s not that it emits CO2 . I almost wish it did , but I &apos;m probably going to accept it . Because it &apos;s cheaper . It &apos;s the previous method , 
CA , and that would be your answer to Björn . Lomborg &apos;s argument that if you spend all of this time and energy to solve the CO2 problem . All the other goals , including poverty reduction , malaria control and so on , are suffering . That it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources . Investing money for it while there are better things . We can do that . 
BG : Well , the actual spending on research . We , the U.S. , should be spending 10 billion more a year . When you do that today , that &apos;s not so dramatic . 
Among other things , it &apos;s not something that 
should suffer . You get to big amounts of money . And here , reasonable people can disagree . If you have something that &apos;s not economic and you try to finance it . For me , most waste is happening here . 
Unless you &apos;re very short . Before a cost breakthrough , you only fund the learning curve . I think we should try more things . They have the potential , much cheaper . 
If the swab you get is a very high energy price , you can be a very low energy price . Then only the rich can keep up . 
I mean , each of us here could be five times as much spending on our energy . Without changing our lifestyle , for 
the bottom two billion , but is it a disaster ? And 
even Lomborg thinks about 
his new mesh , &quot; Why is research not going to be discussed anymore ? &quot; 
He &apos;s still being discussed because of his earlier stories with the skeptic camp . But he understood that this is a very lonely group . And so he &apos;s now bringing the research argument , 
and that &apos;s a thought . I think that &apos;s appropriate : 
Research . It &apos;s just crazy . How little support is given to this . 
CA : Bill , I think I speak for almost all the people here . When I say , &quot; I really hope that your wish will come true . &quot; Thank you very much . 
BG : Thank you . 
I &apos;d like to tell you something . What I did a few months ago when I wrote an article for Italian . Wired noticed , 
I always wrote my synonymous dictionary . But I was busy editing the text . I was done already , and I noticed that I &apos;ve never been looking at my life . What really hampers the word &quot; I 
read you the entry &quot; hampered . 
&quot; Adjective : Curved , helpless , useless . Destruined . Deceased . Mutilated . Wounded . Mastered . Hum . Separated . Exploited Weakened @ impotent @ castriert @ paralyzed @ geandicapt.htm @ senil @ age @-@ weak @ out of circulation @ pulled @ improved @ done @ broken @ borrowed @ counted ( See also injured ) @ useless And @ weak @ 
antonyme ( healthy , strong ) @ efficient 
I have this list read out loud to a friend . And I had to laugh first . It worked so ridiculous . But I just got ready and couldn &apos;t speak any more and had to stop . Read and collect myself first . After this assaulted flood of words and the emotional shock that it 
caused , of course . This was a fractured old synonym dictionary . I just thought that the issue was pretty old , right ? 
But in fact , it was an issue in the early &apos; 80s . When I was just beginning primary school , and that started my self @-@ image . Outside my family environment , I started building and shaping . Also , with regard to other children and the rest of the world around me . 
And thank God . I didn &apos;t use a synonym dictionary at the time . Would 
I take this entry seriously ? Take it into a world I &apos;d been born . Someone like me , who would perceive me as a person whose life in no way goes positive . But can I do it today ? Will I be able to work for the opportunities and adventures I &apos;ve experienced ? So 
I was celebrating the online edition of 2009 . And I expected to make a more appealing contribution here . 
Here &apos;s the updated version of this entry . 
Unfortunately , it &apos;s not much . 
Better , especially , the last two words shake me . Under Near Anonyms , it &apos;s all healthy , but 
it &apos;s not just about words , 
it &apos;s about what we &apos;re thinking about people . The words we describe with these words , 
it &apos;s about values . The words that are in those words , and how we construct those values , affects 
our language . Our thinking , and how we influence the world and the people around us . 
Many ancient societies , including Greeks and Romans , have . Really believed . That the debate of a curse has a great force . Because what you say loudly also manifests itself . 
So what do we want ? Actually manifest . A disabled person . People or a powerful person . People alone , 
a human being . Careless to call a child . Could it be enough to limit it ? And to impose ideas on you . 
Would it not be more beautiful to you ? Open doors . A human being 
. The doors that opened doors for me were my pediatrician . AM A.I. DuPont Institute in Wilmington , Delaware , 
he &apos;s called Dr. Pizzutillo , an Italo @-@ American whose name , you think , is . Can &apos;t most Americans be correct ? So he was always Dr. P. 
called . And Dr. P. always wore very colorful . Flies and was very good at working with kids . 
Simply made . I found the time I was in this hospital . Simply great . Except for my physiotherapy , 
I had to do some exercises , seemingly infinitely . With these thick elastic bands in different colors , you know , around my leg muscles . And I have hated these bands more . As anything else , I hated them , I cursed them . I hated them . 
And imagine I &apos;ve even been in the age of five with Dr. P. negotiating with Dr. P. And so this is how to stop these exercises . Natural , without success . 
And one day he cursed me at one of my exercises . These exercises were just tiring . And mercilessly , and he said to me , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful . And young girl , you &apos;ll one day tear one of these bands , 
and if you can do it , I &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot; 
That was , of course , just a simple trick . By Dr. P. , to do the exercises that I don &apos;t do . I wanted to do with the prospect that the richest five @-@ year @-@ old girl would be in the hospital on the second floor . But he actually got me to do my daily exercise horror with new eyes . So it turned into a new and promising experience . 
And I wonder today how much his vision of me is . As a strong and powerful young girl , my self @-@ image has shaped and I could imagine myself as one of nature &apos;s strong , powerful and atlethic people . To see , 
this is just one example . Of many , like adults in power positions . The imagination of a child can 
stimulate , but like the examples that I &apos;ve already mentioned from the synonymous dictionaries , our language doesn &apos;t allow us to imagine anything . What we all want would be for each and every one of us to be able to do . To be self @-@ confident , to be a powerful person , 
our language lags behind . To be able to follow the changes in society . In many cases , through technological change , which have been triggered from a medical point 
of view , can be : Of course , you say that my legs , laser surgery for visually impaired , knee joints made of titanium and artificial hip joints . For aging bodies that allow people to really all their possibilities to use . And beyond the limits that their natural destiny sets them . To develop . Not to speak at all . To talk about social networking platforms , people allow themselves to give their own identity . To give themselves a definition in their own way , 
and thereby to orient themselves globally to groups . They choose themselves , 
so maybe this technological change is a demonstration . More clearly than ever , that it &apos;s always been a different truth , that every human being in society has something very special and very powerful . And that human ability to adapt , our greatest plus , is . 
Human ability to adapt , that &apos;s an interesting story . Because people keep asking me to tell . How I deal with adversity , and I &apos;ll confess something to you , that sentence has . Never fit me , and I &apos;ve always been very uncomfortable . So I felt the questions people ask about it . And I think gradually I understand why . 
This sentence about dealing with adversity . Lives to the idea that success or happiness depends on it . To master a challenge . Without the experience that it entails , it &apos;s a challenge . As if my life had been so successful because I could fall to the possible traps of a life with a prosthesis . Could or whatever people could , with my disability , 
perceive me ? But the truth is that we change , of course . We are shaped by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physical , emotional or even both . 
And I claim that &apos;s good . 
Adversity is not an obstacle . We need to curve that to better understand our lives . 
Adversity is just part of it . Our lives , 
and I tend to be adversity as my shadow . See , 
sometimes I realize it &apos;s very present . Sometimes it &apos;s hard to see . But it &apos;s always with me . 
And I don &apos;t want to mean by any means the impact or severity of a human struggle to be reduced . 
There are adversity and challenges in life , and they &apos;re all too common . Real and every person goes with it . Different about it , but the question is not whether we can get clear or not with adversity . It &apos;s how we get clear with it , 
so we &apos;re not just responsible for it . The people we love to keep from blows of fate . They &apos;re also preparing to do it , good for it , clear for it . 
And we &apos;re showing our kids . No favor if we give them the feeling that they don &apos;t adapt . You can &apos;t . 
You have to separate two things clearly . One is that the medical fact of being amputated and the other is that society has a view about whether I &apos;m disabled . 
Or not . And to be honest , the only real and lasting disability with which I &apos;m dealing is the only real disability . It has to be that the world is constantly saying . It can use these definitions to describe me . 
In our desire to protect the people who care about us . And to tell you the cold , hard truth about your medical prognosis . Or even a prognosis about quality of life . To put those that you expect , we need to be careful not to lay the foundation for someone actually being disabled . 
Maybe the current concept is . That &apos;s just looking at what &apos;s broken . And how we fix that for each individual , greater disability than pathology . In itself , 
if we don &apos;t treat a person holistically and not all of his forces . And perceive and recognize opportunities . In addition to the natural struggle , let &apos;s create . You may need to lead another disease , 
we degrade . A person who is valued for our society , 
so we have to talk beyond patology , look . And look at all areas of human potential , 
most importantly , but most importantly , it &apos;s that there &apos;s a gap between perception of our inadequacies and our great inventive spirit . 
We should have these challenging times . Not depreciation . Or deny . We should not try to avoid them . We should not try to sweep them under the carpet . It &apos;s about getting opportunities in adversity . 
It &apos;s about recognizing , maybe , I &apos;m more interested in clarifying . That we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome adversity . It &apos;s that we &apos;re open to it . Embracing it . You &apos;re grabbing it in the head . Let &apos;s also use a combat expression , and maybe even dance with it . 
And maybe we can do it . Distasteful things as something natural , coherent and useful to see . And feel like this through . Your presence isn &apos;t like 
this . More so burdened . This year we celebrate the 200th . Birthday of Charles . Darwin : And when he was 150 years ago writing about evolution , Darwin , in my eyes , has something very true in human character . 
I would rewrite it that way : Not the strongest of its kind survives . Nor does it . The smartest of its kind , but the one that best adapts to change . Can 
conflict arise ? Creativity , not . 
Only Darwin &apos;s work we know that the human capacity to survive and flourish from the struggle of the human mind . It &apos;s determined to change through conflict . 
So again , change and adaptation are the greatest abilities . 
Of man , and maybe we know only from what wood we are carved from . If we &apos;re really tested , 
maybe that &apos;s the point . Of adversity , of perception . Of ego , of feeling our own strength . 
We can do something like that ourselves . 
We can give adversity a new meaning . Those beyond difficult times , 
maybe we can treat adversity as change . 
Adversity represents change . We &apos;re not yet adapted to that , 
I think the greatest damage we have done to ourselves . To believe is to believe . 
That we should be normal . Let &apos;s be honest . Who is normal ? 
There is no normal . 
There is the usual , the typical , but not the normal , and would you be that poor , gray person ? Really ? Want to know if there were really ? 
I don &apos;t think it would be great . 
If we wanted to counter this pattern of normality against another of the possibilities or the strength . In fact , to make it a little more dangerous , we could exchange it . So we can exchange the forces of very many children . And invite them to release their very special and valuable skills into society . 
Anthropolgen has found out . That we humans are made by the members of our society to always have one challenge . To be useful . And to contribute . 
There &apos;s evidence that there &apos;s already Neanderthals in the 60,000 years ago , older people and people with severe physical injuries , with worn with . And that might have happened because life experience in these people &apos;s struggle for survival was valuable to society . 
They don &apos;t break these people as broken and useless . They were seen as something special . And valuable was treated 
a few years ago . I went to the city . I grew up in a food market , in that Red Zone . In the northeast of Pennsylvania , and I stood in front of a bushel . Tomatoes . 
It was summer , and I had shorts , and 
I hear a guy behind me . Says , &quot; Well , if that &apos;s not Aimee Mullins , 
and I turn around and see this older man , I had no idea . &quot; Who he is , 
and I said , &quot; Excuse me . &quot; Sir , do we know ? I can &apos;t remember you , and 
he said , &quot; Well , you &apos;re unlikely to be . &quot; Remember me when 
I first saw you . Did I look at you ? Did I look at your mother &apos;s belly ? Bring 
it up ? Oh . 
So , the , and of course , it did , but click . 
This was Dr. Kean , a man . I just made the stories of my mother that day . Because , of course , I was typical of my birthday , two weeks late . 
Did the doctor come for prenatal diagnostics ? My mother was on vacation . And so my parents knew the man who gave me birth . Not at all . 
And because I was born without calf legs , and my feet were directed towards them . And I had only a few toes . On this one and a few toes on the other foot , he was the handler , this stranger had to bring the bad news . 
He said to me , &quot; I had to tell your parents . You would never walk . And never walk that mobile . &quot; He would be like other kids , or you would never live an independent life . And since then , they &apos;ve just lied to me . Really 
punished . Exceptionally , I found that he &apos;s collected newspaper clips of my entire childhood . Whether I was competing in a letter competition in second grade . Whether I was winning with the scouts at Halloween Parade , regardless of whether I was on my scholarship or one of my sporting victories . And he used these clips to get his students to teach . Medical students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School , 
and he called this part of his course . The X factor , the potential . The human will . 
You just can &apos;t stress enough how crucial this factor is . For a human being &apos;s quality of life , 
and Dr. Kean continued . He said , &quot; I learned that if children don &apos;t constantly say something else , and even if they &apos;re just a little bit supported , they get a little bit of support . If you leave kids to 
themselves , then children can do a lot . Look at Dr. Kean . 
Has his thinking changed ? He understood . That medical diagnosis and how someone deals with it , 
two different things . And I too have my thinking going through time . If you change me at the age of 15 , would you have asked me if I could have my prostheses exchanged for legs made of meat and bones ? Would I not have hesitated for a second ? 
I absolutely wanted to be normal at the time . 
If you ask me that today , I &apos;m not so sure . 
And that &apos;s what happened . Because I have experienced something with my legs . And not despite these experiences , 
and maybe this change could happen . Because I &apos;ve met so many people . Am the doors open to me ? Have people instead of meeting ? Who restrict me or muzzle me with 
an idea ? See , it needs . Really ? Just one person who demonstrates to you how they can manifest their forces . And they &apos;re through 
if they allow someone to make their own inner forces work . The human mind is so receptive . If they do that and for someone in a crucial moment , open a door . Then they &apos;re a very good thing for these people . 
They teach them to open doors to themselves . 
The real meaning of the word educate is rooted in the word educe , which 
means producing something . That in one is the potential to tickle out . Again 
, what potential do we want to retrieve now ? 
In the &apos; 60s , a case study was conducted in the United Kingdom . Back then , high schools were transformed into schools . 
They call that there . Streaming trials in the United States , 
we call that tracking . Students are becoming . Selected by grades , 
and the A students are being tested orally harder . Do the better teachers get , etc . 
, they have a three @-@ month period . Students with a sufficiently good grade given . They were told they were aces . They were very smart . And after those three months , they really wrote one . 
And of course , it breaks your heart . To hear that the other way around , the one @-@ serer students were told . They were just enough . And 
it was the same after the three months . But only 
those who still live in school were . Apart from the students who had thrown the school 
, it was very important . This study found that teachers were not inaugurated . 
Teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed . 
They were simply told that they were the Einser students , and that they were the students with the grade enough and have the same . They taught them something 
, and they treated the only real disability . Is a broken mind ? A spirit that was broken . Was not hopeless ? He finds nothing . More beautiful . He lacks our natural childlike . Curiosity . And our innate ability to imagination , but 
if we can do it , the human mind can help with it . And then hoping to hope for himself and other people around him . Lovely to find . Curiously curious and imaginative , then we put our forces in place . 
Really ? Positive : If a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new forms of existence . 
I want to end with a poem . This is from a Persian poet named Hafiz , written in the 14th century . And was written by my friend Jacques Dembois , who told me about it . And the poem is called &quot; The God who knows only four words . &quot; Every child doesn &apos;t know God , the God . The name doesn &apos;t . The God of prohibitions , but the God . The God who knows only four words , and repeats them all the time , he says , &quot; Only come dance . 
&quot; &quot; With me , come dance . &quot; With me , thank you very much . .
