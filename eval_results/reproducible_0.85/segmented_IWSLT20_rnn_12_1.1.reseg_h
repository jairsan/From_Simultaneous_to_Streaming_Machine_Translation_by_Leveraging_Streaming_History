Before a few years ago Here , at TED , Peter Skillman presented a design competition called &quot; The Marshmallow Challenge . 
&quot; The idea is . Quite simple . Four teams have to get the widest possible freestanding structure with 20 spaghetti . CA : 1m tape . CA : 1m thread . And one marshmallow build , 
the marshmallow has to get up on top . 
And though it &apos;s really simple , it &apos;s actually true , really hard because it &apos;s pushing people very quickly to work together . 
And so , I thought this was a really interesting idea . And I have it in a place of design . 
It was a huge success . 
It &apos;s been around 70 workshops since then , worldwide . It &apos;s been with students , developers and architects , even CTOs , the Fortune 50 companies , and there &apos;s something about this task . What depth of impressions into nature are . The collaboration allows and I want to share some of these with you . 
Normally , the majority of people start themselves with regard to the task of orienting themselves . 
They talk about this . They think about how it will look . They &apos;re hanging around power . 
Then they invest in a little time in planning . And organization , they sketch . And they put spaghetti out . 
They invest in a lot of their time in assembling . They &apos;re constantly growing structures . 
And finally , just before they don &apos;t have time anymore , somebody takes the Marshmallow . And they put it gently on top of the top . They take a step back and admire TA @-@ da . They admire their work . 
What , then ? Almost . Always , it happens that the TA @-@ da becomes an UH @-@ Oh , because the weight of the marshmallow causes the whole thing to bend and collapse , 
and there &apos;s a series of people who have a lot more UH @-@ Oh moments than others . And under the worst are freshness , BWL graduates . 
They lie , they cheat . They &apos;re confused . And they really produce poor entities . 
And of course , there are teams that have much more TA @-@ DA formations . And under the best are freshness among the graduates of the kindergarten , 
and that &apos;s quite amazing . 
How we have Peter told us , they not only produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all . 
What they might ask you is , how does this come about ? Why ? What is the point of those ? 
And Peter tells no one . The children are investing time in it . Head of Spaghetti GmbH , right ? 
They &apos;re not investing time in power struggles . 
It &apos;s there , however , another reason , 
and that &apos;s because BWL students were trained , who had a real plan to find . OK ? 
And he was then realized what he was going 
to do . If you were to put the Marshmallow at the top , you don &apos;t have time anymore . And what happens ? 
It &apos;s a crisis . 
Sounds familiar . What ? What else 
do kindergarten kids do ? Is that they do with the Marshmallow ? And prototypes build successful prototypes . Always with the Marshmallow at the Marshmallow top . So that they multiple times have the opportunity to build dilapidated prototypes to repair . 
Constructors recognize these kinds of collaboration . And with each attempt , the core of an iterative process is 
that the kids get immediate feedback . What works and what doesn &apos;t work . 
So this is the performance with prototypes to work with . It &apos;s essential . But look at this , how different teams operate . 
The average for the majority is about the average of about 50 centimeters . BWL students create half of it . Lawyers , a little bit more . But not much . Kindergarten kids are better than adults than adults . 
Who is at the most successful ? 
Architects . And engineers to be lucky . 
1M is that highest . What I saw is what I saw 
and why . Because they triangles understand . And self @-@ reinforcing geometric patterns are the keys to stable structures . 
CEOs are something about average . But here &apos;s where it gets interesting . 
Set it in an executive administrator . On the team , they become significantly better . 
It &apos;s incredible . They see themselves around and recognize and recognize this team will win . They 
can do that prediction . Why is this going ? 
Because they have special skills in process monitoring . 
They run the process . They understand it . 
And that team , which governs and controls and works , is going to do the performance of the team significantly better . 
Specialized skills and process skills and their combination lead to success . 
If you have 10 teams that have typical procedures , you get . CA : 6 : Stable structures have 
, I tried something now exciting . 
I thought , let &apos;s bring the poker bet in the same way . 
So , I offered a $ 10,000 prize of software for the winners , 
what do you think happened ? With these design students , 
what was the result ? 
That &apos;s what happened . Not a team had a stable structure . 
If anyone had a two @-@ inch @-@ high design , they would have the prize after 
they had been home . It &apos;s not interesting , then , that high betting has a strong effect . 
We repeated these exercises with the same students . 
What do you think ? Did it happen ? 
Well , now you understood the advantage of prototyping . 
So this is how the same bad team got . One of the best ones , 
they made the highest construction in the least time . 
It &apos;s like , there are profound lessons for us about nature of propulsion and success , and that &apos;s what we have . 
They like to ask . Why would someone actually have time to invest ? A Marshmallow 
Challenge to create , the reason I help create digital tools and processes , and I help teams help help . Cars , video games and visual effects to create . 
And what the Marshmallow Challenge does is it helps them create hidden assumptions , identify them . 
Because , frankly , every project has its own Marshmallow . The challenge is to 
create a shared experience . A shared language or attitude , the right prototype , 
to build . And this is the value of this experience . This one , this simple exercise , 
and those of you who are interested in it , can do . 
Marshmallowchallenge . COM : Visit : It &apos;s a blog where you can see . How to get the Marshmallows built . 
It &apos;s a step @-@ by @-@ step guide there . 
It &apos;s where you can find crazy examples from all over the world . How people do the system optimisation 
? And they refined it . There are also world records . 
And the basals lesson , I think , is the construction . In fact , a connecting sport , 
it requires that we all make our senses focused on the task . And that we make our thinking optimal use of how our feelings are . And our doing in the challenge of the challenge that lies ahead of us , 
and sometimes a small prototype . This experience , everything it takes , That we get from an UH @-@ Oh to a TA @-@ DA moment , 
and that can make a big difference . 
Thank you very much . 
Do we do it as if we have a machine , 
a big machine . A cool TED @-@ like machine , and that &apos;s a time machine . 
And everybody in this room has to enter and they can 
, in fact , go back to the past . They can go into the future . They can &apos;t go into the here 
and now . And I ask myself , what do you choose ? Would you vote because I would like to have my friends a lot lately ? These questions were asked , and they wanted to have everybody in the past . 
I know not . They wanted to go into time . Before it was cars , or Twitter or America or America is looking 
for the superstar . I know not . 
I am convinced that you somehow want to nostalgia for wishful thinking , to be drawn to . 
And that &apos;s what I understand . 
I &apos;m not part of this group , I have to say . 
I want not to be in the past , and not because I &apos;m an adventurer , I don &apos;t want to be in the past . It &apos;s because 
it &apos;s because opportunities on this planet are not going back . They &apos;re going forward . 
I want to be in this machine . And I want to be in the future . 
This is the greatest time , the greatest time it ever has on this planet . No matter what scale you &apos;re applying . Health , wealth . Mobility , opportunities , falling rates of disease . 
It was never before that time , like this . 
My great grandparents all died when they were 60 . 
My grandparents urged these numbers to be 70 . 
My parents are the 80 percent , the 80 percent , on their heels . 
There should be better , a nine percent , at the beginning of my death . 
But it &apos;s not even a question of people like us , because this is a bigger thing . It &apos;s 
a kid than a kid who &apos;s born today in New Delhi can expect to wait so long to live as long as the richest man in the world . Before 100 years ago , you 
think about it . That &apos;s a tremendous fact . 
And why is that so ? The 
smallpox , smallpox , has billions of people on this planet killed . 
They &apos;ve got demographics of the Earth . On a way , they &apos;ve reshaped it in a way that no war . The way that 
it &apos;s ever managed is they &apos;re gone . They &apos;re gone . 
We &apos;ve got them defeated . Puff 
in the rich world : There are diseases . The millions of us in the world , just a generation ago , who have threatened . Hardly any 
diphtheria is rubbing polio . 
White at all . Someone else knows what that is . Vaccines 
. Modern medicine . Our ability to reach billions of people . That &apos;s successes of the scientific method 
and from my point of view , the scientific method is to try things out . Look at whether it works . It changes when it changes when it doesn &apos;t . It &apos;s one of the greatest achievements of humanity , 
so that &apos;s the good news . 
Unfortunately , that &apos;s already the whole good news . Because it &apos;s a couple of other problems . And they &apos;ve been mentioned many times . 
And one of them is that despite all of our achievements , one billion people on this planet , every day , hungry to bed . Go to 
that number , rise , rise very quickly . And that &apos;s embarrassing . 
And not only that . We have our imagination to use to do that . 
These are the world that is devastated by : Drinking water , primal land , rainforests , oil , gas . They disappear and disappear soon . And if we look at it , we don &apos;t get out of this chaos . We also , 
the question is , can we do that ? I think we can . 
I think so . The billions of people who feed will be fed without the country where they live , raping . 
I think we can do this world with energy , and we can do it with energy . The world that they don &apos;t destroy at the same time . 
I think that &apos;s really what I think . And no . That &apos;s not wishful thinking . 
But that &apos;s what keeps me at night awake . One of the things that keeps me awake at night is , we have scientific progress never before so badly needed as we have never before . 
And we &apos;ve also been unprecedented . We &apos;ve never been able to make it reasonable . We &apos;ve been using it as we can today . 
We &apos;re on the threshold of the amazing . Amazing events on the threshold . Thank you very much . And yet , I really think that we have hundreds of 300 years before the Enlightenment , back to go back to a time to find a time . In the time we fight progress , in the time we talked about these things more violently , In more fronts than we do now . The 
people cover themselves in their pockets of faith . And that &apos;s so tight that you can &apos;t liberate them that way . 
Not even the truth becomes . They liberate 
and hear them . Everybody has a right to their right to opinion . Even a right to their opinion . 
But you know what they &apos;re not entitled to , 
they have no right to their right to their own facts . TSCHULTSCHULTUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUNGUN@@ And I &apos;ve got a 
while to get this out of the question 
about a decade ago . I &apos;ve got an article about vaccines for The New Yorker written , a little article 
and I was amazed at the resistance to it , to resistance to it , to what ended up being the most effective measure . In healthcare , in history of the human race , 
I knew I didn &apos;t know what to do . So , I just did what I always do . I wrote a paper and I drove on . 
And soon thereafter , I wrote an article about genetically modified organisms . The 
same thing , the same thing . Only bigger , 
people played crazy . 
So I got mad about it as well . And I could not understand why I was able to think people thought that was frankenfood . Why ? They thought molecules were on a certain molecule , rather than a random way of moving around , an attack on the territory of nature . 
But you know , I &apos;m doing what . I &apos;m doing . I wrote the article . I was going on . 
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist . 
We type , we type , we &apos;re rich . We go eating . That &apos;s okay . 
But this article did make me worry . And I could not figure out . Why ? And finally , I found out . 
And that &apos;s because it &apos;s because these fanatics who mad me , they made me crazy . Anyway , no fanatics were that . 
That was prudent people . Educated people , decent people . 
They were exactly like the people , like the people in this room . 
And that brought me that mess up . 
But then I thought , &quot; You know what ? Be let &apos;s be honest . 
We &apos;re at a point where we &apos;ve reached a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress . How we used to talk . 
Intermediate about that . 
We talk ironically about it with small quotation marks . So progress , 
okay ? For that there are reasons . And I think we know what we know why these are . 
We have that trust in institutions , in authority and sometimes sometimes in the science , in itself , lost . And it &apos;s not that reason . Why ? That &apos;s not . That &apos;s what 
you should be like . You can just name a few names . And the people are going to understand . 
Chernobyl , Bhopal , Challenger , Vioxx , weapons of mass destruction , the 2000 US presidential election . I mean , 
you know , you can have your own list . 
It &apos;s questions . And problems with the people of Chernobyl , of whom we believed they were always right , are they ? Be sure , be skeptical . Imagine if you 
ask questions , ask evidence . Forbid if you have evidence . 
Take evidence . Take it for granted . 
But now it &apos;s when you get evidence , you have to get evidence . And in it we &apos;re not good . And I can do that from 
the reason I say that we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear , like the one I still have never seen before . And hopefully never again see . Before I go 
about 12 years ago , a story was published . A terrible story . The one that the Autism epidemic with the measles , mumps and rubells , linked vaccine . 
Very scary , upsetting . 
Studies were done in ways that were done to see if that was true , 
upward studies . They were done . This is a serious matter . The data came in , 
the data came in , 
the data came in from the United States , the United Kingdom , Sweden , Canada , and they were all the same , no correlation . No connection , no connection at all . 
It makes no difference . It makes no difference because we have a anecdote belief . We believe what we see . What we see to believe to see , what causes us to really feel . 
We believe not in a bundle of documents from a government clerk who tells us data , And I understand that . I think that &apos;s what we all do . 
But you know what ? That &apos;s 
the result of this was catastrophic . 
Catastrophic because of that fact . The United States is one of the only countries on earth to do this . In that country , the vaccine rate for measles is falling , 
that &apos;s scandalous . And we should be ashamed . 
It &apos;s terrible . 
What is happening ? That we &apos;re doing this . 
Well , I understand that . That &apos;s what I do . Because did 
this somebody here have measles ? 
Has one in the audience ? The somebody there has died of measles is 
not very often what happens . 
In this country , not at all . But 160 000 times , 160 000 times in the world . In the last year . 
This is a lot of measles &apos; death : 20 per hour . 
But because that &apos;s not happening here , you can do it out of place . And people like Jenny McCarthy can do things . And messages from fear . And illiteracy of platforms like Oprah , and Larry King live live preach . And 
that can be done . Because they cause and correlation , not connect . 
They understand not that these things are the same as things seem to be . But almost never . That same thing is , 
and that &apos;s something that we learn to learn . And that &apos;s very fast . 
That guy was a hero . Jonas Salk : 
He liberated us from a guy of the worst scourges in humanity . 
No fear , no torment , polio . Puff disappeared . 
The guy in the middle , not so much . 
He &apos;s called Paul Offit . 
He has just been with a couple of other people a 
rotavirus vaccine . He can use life to 400 lives , 500,000 children per person a year . 
In the developing world , saving pretty 
well . Not . Well . That &apos;s good . Apart from being Paul walking around and talking about vaccines and talking about vaccines , and saying , how valuable they are . And that the people just stop doing that . To complain 
and complain , and he actually says that , Paul 
is , so that &apos;s a terrorist . 
If Paul is a public hearing , when he &apos;s talking , he can &apos;t say without armed guards . 
He gets calls to his home because the people tell him they like to tell him they know where his kids are going to school . 
And why ? Because Paul is using a vaccine . 
I need that not . Tell me , but vaccines are essential . 
Take it . Take it away . Turn back the diseases , terrible diseases . And that &apos;s what &apos;s happening right now . 
We have in this country now , measles 
and this is going to get worse . And pretty soon , kids will be back to die of it . Because that &apos;s just one question , the numbers . 
And they will not just be on measles , they will be dying . 
What is the case with polio ? Take the one . Why not ? 
A fellow militant of mine has given me a couple of weeks ago . And she said , &quot; She believes I &apos;m a little too shrill . 
No one has ever had that said before . 
She would tell her child not to be vaccinated against polio . She would never be 
fine . 
Why ? Because we don &apos;t have polio . And you know what ? 
We had in this country yesterday , no polio . 
Today , I don &apos;t know . Maybe this morning somebody went up in Lagos , in an airplane , and is just flying to Los Angeles . In the moment , he &apos;s over Ohio . 
And in a few hours , he lands . And he rents a car . And he comes after Long Beach . And he gets one of those fantastic TED dinner . Today evening , he goes to visit , 
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a paralyzing disease . And we know that as well , not . Because that &apos;s how the world works . 
Now , let &apos;s say , this is the planet we live on . They don &apos;t act as if it &apos;s not . 
We love it . We love it in lying . We love it . We have it . 
They have it this morning . All of them took their vitamins . 
Echinacea , a small antioxidant . That &apos;s what they &apos;re getting on the leaps . 
I know that they &apos;re doing that . Because the half of the Americans , that &apos;s what they do every day . 
They take that stuff and they take it as alternative remedies and it makes no difference . How often we find out that they &apos;re useless ? 
The data shows that all the time . 
They evaporate their urine . More do they do . Almost never . 
That &apos;s okay . They want to like 28 billion dollars for dark urine to pay . 
I agree with you completely 
: Dark urine , dark . 
Why do we do that ? Why do we do that ? 
Well , I think I understand , we hate the pharmaceutical industry . 
We hate a drug industry too strong a government . We have no confidence in the system . 
And that should be what we should not . Our healthcare system is bad . 
It &apos;s cruel to millions of people . 
It &apos;s absolutely amazing cold . And it &apos;s soul @-@ depressing , even to us who can afford it . 
We walk , therefore , away from where are we going ? We , 
we walk into our arms , into the placebo industry . 
That &apos;s great . I love the placebo industry . 
But you know , that &apos;s really a serious matter . Because that stuff is crap . And we give billions of dollars to do that . 
And I have all sorts of little props . Here &apos;s 
none of them . Gingko was cheating . Echinacea was cheating . Acai . There &apos;s me , I don &apos;t even know what that is . But we give billions of dollars to do that . It &apos;s cheating . 
And you know what ? If I do that , I scream at people shouting at me and saying , &quot; What cares you ? &quot; &quot; Let people , let &apos;s do what they want . &quot; So 
that &apos;s how they feel good . And 
you know what ? They have got wrong 
because it &apos;s not my concern . Whether it &apos;s the Health Minister , who says , &quot; Hmm , I &apos;m going to get the evidence from my experts on mammography , or any cancer quack liver that will treat his patients with coffee intakes . 
&quot; If you look at this path , you go where faith and magic prove . And science is replacing you , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be . 
You get to Thabo Mbeki , in South Africa . 
He brought 400 000 of his people around because he was on the insistence that red beds , garlic and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs . From those of whom we know they &apos;re going to be able to slow down the course of AIDS . 
Hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country worse than any other country of this disease plagued by it . 
Tell them to tell me , please don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences . 
The ones you have , they have . They always have . 
Well , the most brain @-@ free epidemic we &apos;re in is this absurd fight between the two who advocate genetically modified foods and the bio @-@ elite . 
That &apos;s a stupid debate . They have to stop . 
It &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors . 
That &apos;s ideology , not science . 
Everything that we eat . Every grain of rice . Every branch of parsley . Every sprouts has been cut by people . 
You know , there was no mandarin in paradise . 
It was not Cantaloupe melons . It was not Christmas trees . We have that all done . 
We have it in the last few 11 000 years . 
And some of it worked . And some of it didn &apos;t . 
We &apos;re got rid of it . What didn &apos;t work 
now can be done . Now we can do it more precisely . And of course , there are risks . But we can do something like vitamin A in rice , in rice . And that stuff can do to millions of people , millions of people . Their lives to prolong . 
That &apos;s what they don &apos;t want . Do 
I have to say , I understand . I don &apos;t . 
We reject genetically modified food . 
Why do we do that ? 
Well , what I hear all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture . We want no huge fields with huge fields with one thing . That &apos;s wrong . 
We want not to have companies live patenting . 
We want not to have companies seed @-@ owning . 
And you know what ? My answer to all of this is , 
yes . You have been right . Fix . We fix that . 
It &apos;s true . We have a huge food problem . But that &apos;s not science . 
That &apos;s what science has nothing to do with . 
It &apos;s right . Morality , patent crab . 
You know that the science is not a company . 
It &apos;s not a country . 
It &apos;s not even a idea . It &apos;s a process . 
It &apos;s a process . And sometimes it works . And sometimes it doesn &apos;t . But the idea that we &apos;re going to be unable to allow science to do its work , because we &apos;re afraid , is a real impasse . And it keeps millions of people in the flourishing world . 
You know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to get 70 percent more food to grow . As in the moment , 70 percent of 
this investment in Africa in the last 30 years has 
been shameful , shameful . 
You need that . And we &apos;re giving it to you . 
And why genetically modified food ? 
We want people not to be encouraged . This rotten stuff to eat like this , for example , 
Maniok Maniok , is something that &apos;s half a billion people eat . 
It &apos;s about like a potato . 
It &apos;s just a bundle of calories . It &apos;s bad . 
It has no nutrients . It has no protein . And scientists are building all this right in there . 
And then you could get people to eat it . And would not be blind . 
They would not starve . And you know what ? 
That would be nice . It would not be Chez Panisse . But it would be nice . 
And everything that I did to say about it is , why do we fight this ? 
I mean , questions . We ask ourselves , why do we fight this ? 
Because we don &apos;t push genes around . 
It &apos;s not about genes being moved around . It &apos;s not about chemicals . 
It &apos;s not about our ridiculous , ridiculous ones . Passion for hormones . Our insistence on bigger food . Better food . A unique food . 
It &apos;s here not about rice . Krispies : It &apos;s about people at life . It &apos;s here to keep people alive . And it &apos;s going to be high time to understand what that means . 
Because you know what ? 
If we do not do that , if we continue to do the same thing as we do before . We &apos;re going to be guilty of something we believe in , I don &apos;t want to be guilty of . High @-@ tech colonialism . 
There &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here . 
It &apos;s selfish . It &apos;s ugly . It &apos;s our not worthy . And we have to really stop that . 
After this incredibly funny conversation , we want you to say , &quot; Do you still want to get into this ridiculous time machine ? &quot; And in the future , go to any case 
. That wants me to do anyway . 
In the moment , she &apos;s in the present . But we have a tremendous opportunity , 
right ? We can do this time machine on everything that we want . 
We can put it where we want it to move . And we &apos;re going to move it there . Where we want it to be . 
We need to . These conversations are going , and we need to think . But if we &apos;re going to go into the time machine and into the future , we &apos;re going to be happy . That &apos;s what we &apos;ve done . 
I know that we &apos;re able to do it . And that &apos;s what I think is , as far as I &apos;m concerned , something the world needs now . 
Thank you . 
Thank you . Thank you . When Steve Lopez , a columnist of the Los Angeles Times , one day walked through the streets in the center of Los Angeles , he heard wonderful music . 
It came from a man , a African @-@ American , sympathetic , rough , homeless . The guy on a violin played the only violin that had two strings left . 
Many of you will see the story . Because from Steves &apos; articles about this later on , a book became . This , in turn , was filmed with Robert Downey Junior . When Steve Lopez and Jamie Foxx were filmed as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers , the contrabass player who was studying at the Juilliard Conservatory . And his promising career tragically early on through his paranoid career . Schizophrenia ends . 
Nathaniel left Juilliard , suffered a nervous breakdown . And 30 years later , he lived as homeless on the homeless on the streets of Skid Row in the center of Los Angeles . 
I recommend you all Steves &apos; book to read . Or you can watch the movie . So you don &apos;t just see the wonderful connection that exists between these two men , so you can understand how they relate to music . These connections connect helped and how they connect , and how they eventually were the instrument . When this play of words is allowed , it &apos;s half the way . Nathaniel , away from the street , to get away . 
I met Mr. Ayers . IM : 2008 , two years ago , in the Walt Disney Concert Hall . 
He had just had a demonstration of Beethoven &apos;s first . And fourth symphony heard and came and came behind the stage to get me to imagine . 
He spoke in a very cheerful way and sociable tone about the yo @-@ yo . MA : And Hillary Clinton and about how the Dodgers did it never in the baseball , world series , would never do it . And that &apos;s all because of the insidious passage of the first violin . In the last sentence of Beethoven &apos;s Fourth Symphony , 
&quot; We came up with the theme of &quot; Speaking Music . &quot; And a few days later , a few days later , I got an email saying that Nathaniel was in favor of violin lessons with me . 
I have to mention that Nathaniel is a medical treatment that he refused . Because he was already with electric shocks and with Thorazin . And handcuffs are treated . A trauma . That &apos;s what his whole life pursues 
him when he was a result of . He &apos;s now particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases . The ones are sometimes so bad that they can make him tear him apart . And he &apos;s disappearing for days . In the streets of Skid Row , he &apos;s always wandering around this horror and the torture torment of his own mind , 
and in just as much a stage of irritation , Nathaniel was when we were in our first lesson in Walt Disney Concert Hall , where we started our first class . He had this misconception of flickering in his eyes . And he worked completely lost . 
He spoke about invisible demons and invisible smoke and about how things like someone in sleep would poison him . 
I had been scared , not for my own sake , but for my fear that I could lose him , that he could sink into one of his states . And that I could give him his relationship with the violin to destroy . If I started talking about clay ladders and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic . Violin pedagogy to 
talk about . I started talking about just getting started playing . 
I played the first sentence of the Beethoven Violin Concerto , 
and as I played , I fell on the fact that in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes , a complete change was taking place . It was when 
it was as if under the influence of an invisible doctor . It was a chemical reaction of that catalyst . My game was Nathaniel . 
Manian anger turned into a sense of understanding , into a calm one . Curiosity and grace . 
And how through a miracle did a wonder take his violin ? And began after hearing . Some excerpts of violin concerts to play . And asked me then , to turn them to the end . Mendelssohn Chaikovsky , Sibelius . 
We started then , about music , to talk about . Beginning from Bach to Beethoven . Brahms Bruckner And all of the others . BS : From Bartók to Bendelssohn . And I became a salon , 
and I realized that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but he had it with her , but also a close personal relationship . 
He talked about her with a conversation with passion and understanding and understanding . That I would otherwise only talk about my colleagues in the Philharmonic of Los Angeles . I know by knowing music 
and playing about music and talking about music , it was from this paranoid that it was confusing . Man : He &apos;s just been through the streets of Los Angeles , who had just moved . A lovely , educated , excellent in Juilliard musician who had become a student . 
( Music is medicine . ) ( Music changes us for Nathaniel . 
) ( Music : Mental health , 
because music allows him to make his thoughts . ) And delusions with the help of his imagination and creativity into something real 
, And so , he escapes his tormenting state . 
I understood that exactly that is what the nature of art is . 
It &apos;s exactly that that &apos;s why we make music so that we can do something that is within all of us deep inside . Our feelings through our artistic lens , through our creativity , through our creation , can shape into reality . 
And the reality of that expression reaches us all . And moves , inspires . And unites us what 
Nathaniel was about . So that brought him music back , back to a community of friends . 
The redeeming power of music brought him to return . In a family of musicians who are bringing him to understand the talent that he knew and respected 
and I &apos;m going to keep on working with Nathaniel . No matter whether in the Walt Disney Concert Hall or in Walt Disney Concert Hall or Skid Row , because he reminds me of it . Why ? I musicians have become . 
Am many thanks . 
Bruno Giussani : Thank you very much . Thank you . 
Robert Gupta , 
Robert Gupta : I want to play something . That I shamefully , the cellist stolen . 
I hope you will forgive me . 
I am Jane McGonigal . I design computer games . I develop now since 10 years . 
I &apos;ve been playing online games . And my goal for the next 10 years is to do the same thing to make it as easy . The world in which reality is happening to save as it is in online games is 
to save . I have a plan for that . I want more people to convince , including all of you , more time playing with bigger ones . And more great games to spend . 
Right now , we spend three billion hours a week playing online . 
Some of you think maybe that &apos;s what it &apos;s like to spend a lot of time playing games . 
Maybe something about too much time . If you think about how many problems we &apos;re having in the real world , how 
many problems we &apos;re going to solve urgently . Do you actually have my research on the Institute for the Future , however , that &apos;s exactly the opposite ? Right ? 
Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough . It &apos;s not nearly enough to solve the world &apos;s most pressing problems . 
In fact , I &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to dramatically increase that time . 
I have calculated that the time needed is about 21 billion dollars a time of play a week . 
That seems to be something wrong at first . So I repeat , so I &apos;ll do it . It works . It can work if we can solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity . I think I think we need to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week until the end of the next decade . 
No . I mean , it &apos;s really serious . 
Why ? This picture 
describes quite exactly . Why ? I think that games are so vital to the survival of the human species . In the future , serious . 
This is a portrait of the photographer Phil Toledano . 
He wanted to express the feelings of playing . So he has in front of the players . He has built a camera . 
This is one of the classic expressions . 
In playing when you &apos;re not playing when you &apos;re not a player , you may miss some of the nuances in this picture . 
You can probably see this sense of urgency , some fear . But also , extreme concentration . Very deeply deepened . In the solution of a really difficult problem . 
If you also play , you can see some nuances . Here &apos;s the upward @-@ drawn eyes and the mouth are the ones that are a sign of optimism . The eyebrows show surprise . 
This is a player who is on the edge of what &apos;s called an epic victory . 
Oh , you know that ? OK . 
Great . So , we have some players . Here &apos;s 
an epic victory . Is an outcome ? That &apos;s so very positive that it &apos;s previously even not very well known that it was possible at all . 
It was almost beyond the imagination . And if you did , if you do , you &apos;re shocked that you actually get to be able to do 
that . That &apos;s a epical victory . 
This player is standing on the verge of an epic victory . 
And this is it , what we &apos;re doing on millions of faces of problem solvers all over the world . If we &apos;re going to break the hurdles of the next century , face of those who face the odds of all odds . AM : On the brink of an epic victory . 
Well , unfortunately , we &apos;re more likely to see this face . IM : In real life , when we face difficult problems . 
I call it &quot; the one in life &quot; . I &apos;m bad face . 
And it &apos;s actually my face , see . You know . OK . That &apos;s me . 
How I see that ? IM : In life , I &apos;m bad face . 
This is a graffiti in my life , my former home . IM : Berkeley , California , where I did my PhD study on why we &apos;re better at playing than in real life . 
This is a problem . This is a problem that many players have . 
We think we &apos;re not really doing so well in reality as we are in play . And 
I mean , not only less successful . Although that &apos;s part of it , 
we &apos;re doing more in game worlds . 
I mean , good in connection with the motivation , something important about doing . Inspired in collaboration with each other . 
When we &apos;re in a game world , I think many people in us think that we &apos;re in our best version , at any time and immediately , helpful , persistent . That problem of solving , trying to solve as long as necessary , after failure , again . Try and try , and in reality . 
If we fail , if we fail , if we encounter obstacles , we often feel different . 
We feel different , overwhelmed . We feel overwhelmed , defeated . We feel comfortable , threatened . Maybe depressed , frustrated . Or cynical , these feelings , 
we never have . If we play games in games , there are games , they just don &apos;t exist . 
And that &apos;s it . That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to study as a PhD student . 
Why is it in games ? It &apos;s impossible to think . You could not just think anything 
could be done . How can we do those feelings out of the games into the reality ? So , 
I looked at games like World of Warcraft . This is what the ideal environment for community problem solving is . 
And I have some things to say that epic victories in epic online worlds . 
So , making it possible first , if you &apos;re in one of these online games , especially at World of Warcraft , there is . It &apos;s a lot of different characters ready to give you a world saving mission . Confidence and trust it immediately . 
But not only any mission , but also a mission . The mission perfect for your current level at the game . 
Right ? So , you can do that . 
You get never a task . The one you don &apos;t solve . 
But always at the edge of your skills , so you have to make an effort . 
But it &apos;s not unemployment . In World of Warcraft , you &apos;re not sitting around . And you turn around , you have decks , you always have targets . Something important about doing . 
And it &apos;s kind of employees . 
Where you go , anyway . Hundreds of thousands of people who are working with you to get your epic mission done . 
That &apos;s what we have in real life , not that easy . This feeling that , if you have a fingertip , you have employees who are willing to do it in ways that are . 
And there &apos;s also this epic story . This inspiring story , why do we &apos;re there and what we &apos;re doing , is what we have to do . Then you get this whole positive thing feedback . 
You have probably heard about level up and 1 strength , and you know , you know ? Or 1 intelligence . 
This constant feedback gives you no idea what &apos;s true in life . 
If I do this stage , I have no one talking , I don &apos;t have one . And one crazy idea . 20 crazy idea . 
I get 20 real life . 
This feedback , not so . That problem with online collaboration . How World of Warcraft is that the problem is so satisfying that it is . Anytime , on the edge of an epic victory , that we prefer to stand all our time in these game worlds . 
They &apos;re just better than the world of reality . 
Until now , all the World of Warcraft players have come together . Five percent ( 93 million years ) So spent the virtual problems of virtual Azerbaijan . 
That &apos;s not necessarily something bad . 
It sounds like bad . 
But to do it , in context , I think , five percent ( 93 million years ago ) started . Our first primate ancestors , we started 
walking upright , the first upright primacy . So OK , 
so if we talk about how much time we spend right now playing games with , it &apos;s going to be . That &apos;s just meaning . When do you get to spend time with regard to scale ? The human development . Before you look at what &apos;s extraordinary . But also appropriate . 
Because it &apos;s a fact that it turns out that by doing all this time at play , we &apos;re using it all the time . In fact , changing what we &apos;re doing as humans are able to do . 
We &apos;re developing into a community . Thinking , heartfelt beings . 
That &apos;s the truth . That &apos;s what I believe in . 
Look at this one interesting statistic . The recent by a researcher who &apos;s been researching Carnegie Mellon University , published this . The average young person of today , in a country with a strong playing culture , spends . Ten thousand hours with online games , up to the age of 21 . 
So 10 000 hours is a time of very interesting numbers from two reasons . 
First of all , for children in the United States , 10 080 hours is the exact total time they spend in school , from the time of fifth grade to the end of high school . If you never lack it , 
so we have here a complete parallel education path where young people are learning the same way . What it means is a good player to be . How do you do anything else you can in school ? And maybe you have 
some of you who have the new book by Malcolm Gladwell . Overflying skiers , so you know his theory of success . The theory of success , the theory of success , the 10,000 hours . 
You &apos;re based on the great research that cognitive science has done , that if we spend 10,000 hours with laborious study of any subject , until we 21 years of age , we &apos;ll have to do that . We &apos;re going to master it , 
we &apos;re going to do as well in whatever we do . How the most important people in the world . 
So what we &apos;re having here is a complete generation of young people , the master players , 
who are the big question , so what exactly are the players masterful ? All right . 
Because if we do that , if we could figure out , we would have , kind of , unprecedented human potential at our disposal . 
So many people have we at present in the world . The people who have at least an hour a day playing online . 
This is our master players : 500 million people , who are exceptionally good at something . 
And in the next decade , we have another billion players , and we have a million . The extraordinary good at what is also , whatever . 
If you do , you don &apos;t hear it yet , 
the game industry has developed . Consoles , the energy saving and the mobile network working instead of broadband Internet , so that players all over the world , especially India , China , Brazil , can play online . 
You &apos;re expected to have an additional billion players . In the next decade , 
we have a total of 1.5 billion players . 
So I have started to think about what it is . What we have in these games to master ? Make this one . 
Here are the four things I found . When I first came up with urgency optimism , 
OK ? Imagine if you can imagine extreme extremes of self @-@ motivation . 
Imagine urgency optimism , desire is immediate , to do something . A hurdle to overcome . Together with the belief that we can create a well @-@ founded hope of success . 
Players believe always in believing that a epical victory is possible . And that it &apos;s always worth it . It &apos;s trying and trying to do it , and that &apos;s the 
same : Players don &apos;t sit around . 
Players are masters in spiders . Poets of social networks . 
It &apos;s a lot of interesting research . The ones show that we people more like after we start working with them . Even if they let us down badly , 
the reason for that is because it &apos;s a lot of trust that requires someone to play a game with . 
We trust in the fact that somebody has time to spend with us , that the rules are being respected , that we have the same goal . And until the end of the game , so that allows us 
to play together . That allows us to grow bonds , trust and trust with each other . 
As a result , we build stronger social relationships , happy , productive 
. Fantastic . 
You know , there &apos;s a reason . Why ? Why ? The average word of Warcraft player plays 22 hours a week , as part @-@ time job , so to speak . 
The reason we play is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier . But hard to work than if we work hard to relax or nothing to do . 
We know that we are human beings , as human beings , working optimally . If we work hard , meaningful work 
and players are always players ready , hard to work . If they do the right job , 
and eventually , epic meaning , 
players love . It &apos;s part awe . Herring missions of planetary proportions to become . 
Here &apos;s a background information to get this right . You know , you probably all know Wikipedia . That &apos;s the biggest Wiki in the world . That &apos;s the 
second largest Wiki in the world . With almost 80 000 entries , it &apos;s the World of Warcraft . 
Wiki : Five million . People use it every month . 
They have more information about World Wiki about Warcraft . IM INTERNET COVERED THAN OVER ANY ONE OTHER THEME IN ANY OTHER THEME Wiki . 
IM WELTWELT You create a epic story . 
You create an epic source of the knowledge about the World of Warcraft . 
OK . IM : So these are four superpowers . IM : To a single result , players are super @-@ powerful , hopeful individuals . 
ES : People who believe that they are as individuals , the world is able to change . 
And that only problem is that the only problem is they believe they can change the virtual worlds . But not the real . That &apos;s what the problem is . 
That &apos;s the problem . The one I &apos;m trying to solve , 
Edward Castronova , is a scientist . 
His work is awesome . 
He &apos;s studying why people have so much time , energy . And money in online worlds , 
and he says , &quot; We &apos;re witnessing not less than no less mass emigration in virtual worlds . &quot; And online gaming environments , 
and this by an economist , so he &apos;s logical . 
And he says , &quot; Not as I do . &quot; I develop games . I &apos;m something exuberant . 
So he says that makes actually , in fact , sense . Because players can play in online worlds more than they can in real life . 
They can do in games stronger social ties , Than in real life , they get more feedback . And rewards in games . When in real life , 
so he says it &apos;s currently , it &apos;s perfectly logical that players have more time in virtual world than in real life than 
they have . I agree with you first of all , that &apos;s logical . 
But it &apos;s definitely not an optimal situation . 
We have to start to build the real world into a game . 
My inspiration comes from a moment of events . That second 500 years ago , 
it &apos;s been around , and there are these ancient cubes of sheep &apos;s cocks . You know , 
before these fantastic game econtrollers , there were sheep &apos;s cocks , 
and these were , so to speak , the first of people to develop . Play equipment , and if you &apos;re working with the works of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus . Do you know these stories ? The story about how and why and how games were invented . 
According to Herodotus , games became more accurate craps in the kingdom of Lydia . While playing famine , supposedly there were some famine 
, there was such a great famine that the king of Lydia turned into a crazy idea that the 
people suffered , the people fought . 
It was a extreme situation . You needed a extreme solution . 
So they invented , according to Herodotus . That dice game and agreed a national strategy on a day after day , you would eat , the next day you would . You would play 
and they would play so much into the dice game , you would be so deeply immersed . There &apos;s games so fascinating and so fascinating and satisfying , happy productivity surrounds us that they forget they would be , there &apos;s nothing to eat . 
And then , the next day , you would play , and the next day , you would eat . 
And according to Herodotus , they survived 18 years of life . These famines , by living on a day , and on a day of playing the next . 
The same is what I think we &apos;re playing today . 
A : We &apos;re playing games to help alleviate the suffering of the real world . We &apos;re playing games to help everything . That &apos;s what &apos;s happening in the real world . It &apos;s not working in everything that &apos;s not satisfying in real life . And we &apos;re catching up with what we need from the games . 
But that has to be the end , not the end . 
That &apos;s what &apos;s exciting . 
According to Herodotus , after 18 years , famine has not improved . So , the king decided to make a final cube game . 
She shared that kingdom in two : Halves . 
She played a cube game . And the winners were allowed to become an epic adventure , 
they left lydia and made lydia and set out to search for a new home , and they were going to leave . They left just like many people . How it was to survive food ? And they were looking with the rest for an area where there was a place where they could thrive . 
That sounds crazy , right ? 
But the latest DNA evidence shows that the Etruscans who later became the Roman Empire . The same DNA as the ancient DNA as the Lydians . 
So it was recently that scientists came to the conclusion that herodotus , crazy story , is actually true . 
And geologists found evidence of a global cooling down . The almost 20 years took , which was the explanation of famine . 
So maybe this crazy story could be right . 
Maybe you &apos;ve actually got your people through games saved by playing by getting 18 years old by playing games , fleeing 18 years . And then this inspiration had , and so much about the famine coexistence , learning that playing with each other would make it save the whole civilization . 
So , that &apos;s what 
we can . We play since 1994 Warcraft . 
That was the first strategy game in real time . The World of Warcraft series . 
That was before 16 years ago . 
It was 18 years of playing craps . We play craps for 16 years . 
I &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game . 
So , they sent half of their civilization to the search for the search for a new world . So , I &apos;m taking my 21 billion hours of play a week . We should be agreeing that 
the world is half of us , one hour a day , playing games . Until we reach the problems of the real 
world , we have solved them . I know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; How do we solve problems ? &quot; The real world in games . And 
exactly that question is one that I &apos;ve done my work on in recent years at the Institute for the Future . 
We &apos;ve got this banner in our office in Palo Alto , Palo Alto . It expresses out how we can make the future understand . 
We want not to try to make the future say beforehand 
what we want . Is the future to 
be created ? We want to make the best possible outcome . And then people get empowered to empower this idea into reality . 
We put ourselves in epic victories . And we give people the opportunity . They give them the opportunity to achieve it . 
I show you a very brief three games . The ones I designed to make it possible to try and emulate people epic victories in their own future . That &apos;s 
this world without oil . 
That game is from 2007 . 
It &apos;s a game online where there &apos;s a shortage of oil that you have to overcome . 
Oil scarcity is invented . But we have enough online content to do that . It &apos;s for you to become realistic , and you can live your real life . In fact , without oil , so if you live to play , you say to us where you live . And then you get news films in real time . The ones that show you how much oil costs , which is not there . How food supplies are affected , 
how transport is affected . Whether schools are closed , whether it &apos;s riots . And they have to figure out how to get their real life done . If it &apos;s true and we &apos;re asking you about it , blog videos or photos or stop it . 
We have this game with a one hundred and 700 players in 2007 . And we have them since then , over the last three years , been with them . 
And I can tell you it &apos;s been a changing experience . 
Nobody wants to live his life . Because it &apos;s good for the environment . It &apos;s good for us , or because we should . 
But if you &apos;re in an epic adventure , and you &apos;re told , &quot; Get us going . &quot; That oil from 
the oil . That &apos;s a fascinating adventure . It &apos;s something you can go to , 
and you can find out how they survive . Would the majority of our players have ? The ones in the game would retain the habits they learned . So they would 
have us vote for the next world saving game . A bigger , higher goal than the only oil shortage . 
We have that game , Superstruct , at the Institute for the Future . 
The starting point is to calculate a supercomputer that people only have to 23 years to go on the planet , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing . 
This supercomputer is called Global Dismortality Sensitization System . Of course , 
the call to players to sign up . Do we have almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer film ? 
They know Jerry Bruckheimer movies where it &apos;s the dream team . They have the astronaut , the scientist , the ex @-@ Sträfling , and only together can they save the world . 
But in our game , instead of just five people , instead of just saying , &quot; Everyone &apos;s on the dream team . &quot; And it &apos;s our job to do the future for energy , food , health , safety and the future of social justice , and it &apos;s a challenge to do it . Eight 
thousand players played this game . Eight weeks , 
They found 500 incredible . Creative solutions that they read about can be found . If you &apos;re Google Superstruct and Google 
the last game , we &apos;ll take the third of March out . It &apos;s a game in collaboration with the team of the World Bank . 
If you do the game , you &apos;ll get from the World Bank the social reformer award , 2010 graduation . We &apos;re 
working with universities all over Sub @-@ Saharan Africa . And we invite you to redesign social redesign , learn how to do it . 
We have a comic book on this . We have levels up for regional level . We understand knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and ingenuity . 
I want to invite you all . This game with boys and boys to share . Everywhere on the planet , especially around the world , in developing areas that benefit from this , they &apos;re all together . Their own social ventures to imagine , to imagine the world to 
save . I come now to the end . 
I want to leave you with a question : 
What do you think is happening ? 
When I say , next , we have all these fantastic players . We have games that give us a show . What we do can , but we have the real world , still not saved . 
Well , I hope you will tell me that you agree that players have human resources . The ones we work on in real life are the ones we can use . And that games are a big issue for change . 
We have these whole superpowers , happy productivity . The ability to have tight social networks . Urgency optimism and the desire for epiepiepical meaning that we need . 
I hope really that we together together will have important games to play on this planet to make another century of survival . 
And I hope you will , with me , play these games . And play 
when I go to the next decade ahead . I &apos;m going to do two things to make sure that we can create any imaginable future . And that we all can create all kinds of games . So I &apos;m going to say , let &apos;s play the world @-@ changing games . Let &apos;s start . 
Thank you . 
Since some time , I &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect . It may be strange that the placebo effect of a magician is interested in it . It &apos;s not unless you look at it like me , as a deception . The ones that lead to something real when someone is just tight enough to believe in it , 
in other words , have sugar pills . In some studies , a measurable effect has shown the placebo effect , and that &apos;s just because of it . Because the person thinks what to do with it is . A pharmaceutical or a kind of a kind of pain management , for example , if the patient is only firm enough to believe in it , there &apos;s measurable action in the body that &apos;s called the placebo effect . 
A deception is becoming something real , because somebody somebody like this perceives it so 
that we can also understand each other . I &apos;m going to give you a basic , very simple magic trick . 
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . That &apos;s a trick that &apos;s at least been around since the 1950s in every children &apos;s magic book . I myself have it from 
the cub scout magic . The scout scout in the 1970s learned , 
I &apos;m going to teach it for you . And he &apos;s going to explain it , 
and then I &apos;m going to explain why I explain it . 
So , you see what happens . 
That knife . That you &apos;re going to be able to study , my hand that you can study . 
I &apos;m going to just get the knife in my fist like that . 
I &apos;m going to push my sleeves back 
and make sure that nothing in my sleeves disappears or disappears from it or comes out of it . I &apos;m just going to put my wrist right here , 
just squeezing it together , so you can see that at no time is anything moving . As long as I can push here , nothing can go in my sleeve or come out . 
And that goal , in fact , is very simple . 
I &apos;m going to open my hand . And hopefully , if everything goes well , it &apos;s going to go through my bare physical 
magnetism . It &apos;s actually sitting so firmly on its place that I &apos;m going to shake it . Without it being the knife falling down , nothing moves 
into my sleeves , or comes out . No trickery . And they can do everything . 
TA @-@ DA : 
Now , this is a trick that I often do to small kids . The ones who are interested in magic , because you can do a lot about deception , because you can learn a lot about deception . If you &apos;re looking at it more closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick to do . 
I think many of you here probably know about this . This trick , it works . 
So here &apos;s how 
I hold the knife in my hand . 
I say that I &apos;m going to close my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or comes out , and this is a lie . 
The reason I &apos;m going to tie my wrist is because of this . The reason I hold my wrist is that it &apos;s the real secret of illusion . 
In the moment , when I &apos;m talking about my hand from you , so you can move it from behind , it moves this finger . Here &apos;s my index finger , just from where it was . In a position in which it was so 
stretched out , 
great trick . There &apos;s a guy sitting back there who 
had no childhood , so he &apos;s here . Right , 
and if I turn around , the finger changes its position 
and now , you could talk about it . Why ? That &apos;s a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that here down here , only three fingers are visible , because the mind and the mind and the way it sees information . They don &apos;t count individually . One , two , three , but they see them as a group . 
But that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about . Now here , actually , not at all . And then open . I mean , hand . 
Of course , it &apos;s held there . But not by the magnetism of my body , but by a trick , by my index finger , which is there now . 
And if I do my hand close , the same thing happens by turning back . By doing this motion , it &apos;s hidden that the finger moves back . I take this hand away and 
I take this hand away , and here &apos;s the knife . 
This trick can be done to your friends and neighbors . Thank you . 
Now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ? 
Well , a year ago or so , I read a study that really really bypassed me , actually . 
I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that &apos;s why for me . It was an amazing thing . 
It has turned out this way . It turns out that if you &apos;re using placebo in the form of a white pill , you &apos;re going to have a place . In the form of an aspirin tablet , it &apos;s simple . It &apos;s a round white pill that has a certain measurable effect . 
But if you want to change the shape in which you put placebo to , say , a smaller pill , for example . And these blue dyes and a blue letter on it is a blue pill that is actually measurably more effective . And that , 
even though none of them , any pharmaceutical ones , are just sugar pills . 
But one white pill is not a white pill as good as a blue pill . 
What that made me really freak out of it . 
It put itself , however , out that this hasn &apos;t all been done yet . 
If you put capsules , they &apos;re still more effective than tablets . Everybody , shape 
, color capsule , that &apos;s at one end yellow . And at the other side red is better than one white capsule , 
right ? Also , dosage plays a role . 
A pill twice a day is not that good as three times a day . I can &apos;t get myself to the one that &apos;s the exact statistics . Remember , I &apos;m sorry . 
That &apos;s the key . But 
is that the other thing is that dosage also plays 
a role ? And the shape plays a role . 
And if you take the ultimate placebo effect , you have to go to the needle . 
Right ? A syringe with a ineffective one . A couple milliliters , an ineffective substance , you can give to a patient . 
That creates a very strong image , right ? In the head , that &apos;s a lot stronger than a white pill . 
These are graphs that are really . I &apos;m going to give you another time . If we have a projector , 
the fact is that the fact is that the white pill isn &apos;t as good as the blue pill . The ones that aren &apos;t as good as a capsule . The ones that don &apos;t work as well as the needle . 
And nothing of that has any really pharmaceutical property . It &apos;s just our faith in it , which is in us stronger impact . 
I wanted to know if I could take this idea for a magic trick . 
I &apos;m going to take something that obviously is a deception . And let it really look like this . 
We know , of course , from that study , that you can grab a needle . If it goes to the point , 
this is a 18 @-@ inch @-@ long needle . It &apos;s very , very sharp . And I &apos;m going to start by giving you a little bit of sterilizing . That &apos;s 
this really my flesh . It &apos;s not Damian &apos;s special bred meat . 
That &apos;s this : My skin . That &apos;s not a special effect . It &apos;s not from Hollywood . 
I &apos;m going to put this needle in my skin . And through it , I &apos;m going to push it until it &apos;s back to the other side . 
If you &apos;re getting bad when you &apos;re slightly powerless , if you &apos;re going to get sick . I have this . I have some friends . Last night , in the hotel room . And some people who I &apos;m not familiar with . And there &apos;s a woman , almost powerless , getting out of it . 
I &apos;m suggesting , then , if you &apos;re going to get bad at you quickly , look for the next 30 seconds away , or you know what ? I &apos;m going to start the first delicate part . Here in the back , 
you can do it in a moment . You can see it also , if you want . 
So , it &apos;s going to be so accurate . Here , where my meat starts . AM : At the bottom of my arm , I &apos;m just going to make a little bit of 
a break . Do I really regret ? Do you do that ? 
Crazy ? And now . Simple , a little bit . By my skin and on my skin and on the other side , out again . 
Now , we &apos;re actually in the same situation . The ones we do with the knife trick , 
about , 
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers . Or ... So , 
I &apos;m going to show you . That &apos;s one , two , three , four , five . 
Now , yeah , 
I know what people think . If you think that 
, you say , okay . The one is certainly not so stupid . And it &apos;s self @-@ stifling , just around us , a few minutes long , to entertain . 
Now , then I &apos;ll tell you , How does 
that look ? Here &apos;s pretty good . 
Yes . I know . And the people in the back say , okay . I have that not right . The 
people in the adjoining rooms come now in . Let &apos;s 
let me tell you from it . The proximity is shown . 
This is really my skin . This is not a special effect . 
It &apos;s from Hollywood . This is my flesh . And I can do this around . 
I &apos;m sorry if you get bad . Look at it away . Look at it . Don &apos;t look at it . 
People in the back , or those who later . Sometime once , on video , you &apos;ll see it , &quot; Well , yeah , that looks pretty good . &quot; Impressive . But if it &apos;s real , it would look like it . You see , here &apos;s a hole . And there , if it &apos;s really real , it would bleed . Okay . 
Let &apos;s let me just add a little blood to you . 
Yeah , here it is . 
Normally it would be me now to take out the needle . 
I would take out my arm . And I would show you that there are no wounds there . 
But I think in this frame , here and with the one intent to get out of a deception something real , real . Will I take the needle ? There in there . And so , from the stage , 
we &apos;re going to go into the next few days , a few more times . 
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . Thank you very much . 
So I have a lot of life in my life known fish . 
I have only two loved . 
This first one , that was more like a passionate affair . 
It was a beautiful fish , tasty , good consistency , rich . A bestseller on the menu . 
What a good fish . 
Still better . It got better in aquaculture after aquaculture , supposedly the highest standards of sustainability . 
You could imagine , then , that you could feel sold it . 
I had a lot of beauty with this beauty , a relationship over several months . 
One day , the company &apos;s boss called and asked if I was going to show at an event . About the sustainability of the farm . 
Of course , I said , 
&quot; Here was a company . The one that tried to solve what this unimaginable problem was . For our chefs , it &apos;s become like , &quot; How do we keep fish on our menus in 
the last 50 years ? &quot; We , the seas , fish as we have , beaten forests bare . 
It &apos;s hard to destroy the destruction . 
90 percent of the big fish , the ones we love , the tuna , the cures , the salmon , the swordfish . They &apos;re collapsed . 
It &apos;s almost nothing more left . 
So it &apos;s likely to be aquaculture , or bad aquaculture , fishing . A part of our future . 
Many arguments against fishing facilities polluting fish farming , most of them polluting the environment , anyway . And they &apos;re inefficient . Take the tuna . A big disadvantage . 
It has a feed recovery of 15 percent to one . 
That means 15 pounds of wild fish are needed . So you can get a pound of farmed tuna , 
not very sustainable tastes . 
Also , not very good . 
So here was finally a company , which tried to get it right . 
I wanted to support them . 
AM : The day before the event , I called the head of public relations for the company , to name it . 
We call him Don Don 
, I just said , &quot; To get the facts . Right ? &quot; &quot; To have you famous for having them . &quot; So far out there in the sea , you grow the environment so that you don &apos;t pollute . That 
&apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; We &apos;re so far out there that the waste from our fish is distributed . It &apos;s not concentrated . And 
then he added , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re basically a separate one . 
These feed recycling of 2.5 percent to one percent , &quot; he said , 
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot; 
Two and a half percent to . One great , 
2.5 to . One thing that feeds ? You 
&apos;re sustainable proteins , he said . 
Great , I said , &quot; I put up , &quot; 
and that evening I lay in bed . And I thought , &quot; What the hell is a sustainable protein ? 
&quot; So , I called the next day . Shortly before the event , Don , I called . 
I said , &quot; Don , what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot; 
He said , &quot; He doesn &apos;t know . &quot; He &apos;s going to ask . 
Now , I telephoned with a couple of people in the company . Nobody could tell me a proper answer . Until I finally got to the head biologist &apos;s 
phone , we call him Don Don Don 
, too . I said , &quot; What , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot; 
Well , he mentioned some algae and some fishmeal and then then he said , &quot; Chicken pellets . &quot; 
I said , &quot; Chicken pellets . &quot; 
He said , &quot; Yes . &quot; Feathers , skin , bone meal . Remnants dried . And to feed processed . 
I said , &quot; How much percent of your food is chicken in the 
assumption of maybe two percent ? 
&quot; Well , these are about 30 percent , he said . &quot; 
I said , don . &quot; What is sustainable about this ? Chicken in fish ? Feeding 
. It was a long break in the world of leadership , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . 
I loved myself . &quot; I loved this fish . 
No . Not because I was a self @-@ righteous connoisseur . And , &quot; Good man , that &apos;s me , &quot; 
I actually am . 
No . I have no , actually , of this fish , because I swear by God , the fish after this conversation , after chicken tasted chicken , 
This second fish , that &apos;s a different species of love story . 
It &apos;s the romantic species that is the species where you &apos;re ever better . You know , you get to know your fish , the more you love the fish . 
I have it first in a fish restaurant in southern Spain . 
A friend journalist had been with us for a long time talking about this fish . 
She has been kind of cupping us . 
He came up with the table with a bright , almost shimmering white color . 
The cook had him cooked . 
&quot; Stop twice . 
&quot; Amazingly , he was still delicious . 
Who can buy a fish ? So good . Taste . Let &apos;s taste after he was cooked . 
I can &apos;t . But this guy can &apos;t call it . 
We can call it Miguel . In fact , he &apos;s called Miguel . 
And no . He has the fish , not cooked . And he &apos;s not a chef . At least to the way they cook and I under this , you and I understand . 
He &apos;s a biologist with Veta , La Palma . 
That &apos;s a fish rearing in which southwest corner . Spain , 
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river . 
Guadalquivir , right up to the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of Argentines . 
They grew meat cattle on what was in fact wetlands . 
They made this by making the river land drainage . 
They built these complicated sequences of this canals . And they pushed water out of the country , And out into the river . 
Now , they couldn &apos;t make it happen that didn &apos;t work economically . 
And environmentally , it was a disaster . 
It brought about 90 percent of the birds around , which is what this place is , many birds . 
And so it happened in 1982 , when a Spanish company with environmental awareness . This country bought 
what did they buy ? 
They bought the river , the river of water , the other way around . 
They had literally the lever laid over . 
Instead of the water pushing out , they used the channels to do it . This water was pulling back in . 
They were flooding the channels . 
They were creating an 11,000 acres of fish rearing , perch , sea ash , shrimp , eel . And in doing so , Miguel and his company have the ecological destruction completely reversed . 
The farm is incredible . 
I mean , they have something like this never seen before . They &apos;re 
staring out at the horizon of one million miles , a million miles away . And everything that they see is all flooded canals . And these density , lush march , 
I was there , even not long ago , with Miguel . 
He &apos;s a tremendous guy . Three parts : Charles Darwin . And one part : A crocodile to kiss . 
Okay . There were us . And we fought through . The wetlands and I chastise . And sweat has mud to the point where I kneel . And Miguel keeps in peace . A biology lecture . 
Here &apos;s where he lifts a rare track . 
Now , mentioned . He mentions mineral needs of phytoplankton 
and here , here he sees a pattern of bundles of bundles . That &apos;s what he calls the Tanzanian giraffe . Remembering 
it , it turns out that Miguel has the largest part of his career in Mikumi National Park in Africa , in Mikumi National Park . 
I asked him how he was going to get a fish expert like this . 
He said , &quot; Fish , I don &apos;t know about fish . 
I &apos;m a fish expert . I &apos;m an expert in relationships . And 
then he goes . &quot; And he falls into more talk . It &apos;s about rare birds and algae . And strange aquatic plants . 
And don &apos;t get me wrong . That was really fascinating . You know , the biotic community , unplugged ? So , in the way 
it &apos;s great . But I was in love . 
And my head got weak over over this cooked piece of delicious fish . That I was on the eve , 
so I got him interrupted . I said Miguel . How does it happen that your fish is so good ? He 
showed up the algae . 
I know boy , the algae of phytoplankton , the relationships . That &apos;s incredible . 
But what do you eat ? 
How is the recycling of feed ? Well 
, he goes on . I &apos;ll tell you that it &apos;s such a rich system . It &apos;s that the fish eat what they eat in the wild , they eat . 
The vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , that &apos;s what the fish feed . 
That system is like healthy . It &apos;s completely self @-@ explanatory . 
It &apos;s not food . 
The food is from a farm , which owns its animals that doesn &apos;t feed . Later on 
the day , I drove on this plot with Miguel around . And I asked him , &quot; I said for a place that was so natural to be , different from any place that would be on which I &apos;ve ever been . &quot; Like , how do you measure success ? In 
that moment , it was when it was like a film director demanding a stage change . 
And we bowed around the corner . And we offered ourselves the most incredible sight . Thousands and thousands of pinkers , flamingos , literally pinker carpet . So far as the eye can see . 
That &apos;s success . Said he , 
&quot; Look at her bellies . &quot; Pink , 
they &apos;re slugging . Sludge 
. I was totally confused . 
I said Miguel . Sludge them not your fish . Yeah 
. Said he . 
We lose 20 percent of our fish . And fish eggs to birds . 
Now , last year , this was on this plot 600,000 birds . More than 250 different species . 
It &apos;s today the largest . And one of the most important private bird reserves in Europe has become . 
I said Miguel is a good bird . It &apos;s not a thriving bird population . It &apos;s the last one . It &apos;s the one you have on a fish farm . He 
shook his head . No . 
He said , &quot; We &apos;re building extensively , not intensively . &quot; That &apos;s 
this : An ecological network . That &apos;s 
the flamingos eating the shrimps , 
the shrimps eating the phytoplankton . 
The closer the pinker the belly , the better . That system , 
okay ? Let &apos;s let &apos;s think about that . A farm that has its animals not feeding . And a farm that has its success on the health of its predators , 
A fish rearing . But also a bird reserve . 
Oh . And by the way , these flamingos should not even be there from the outset . 
They breed in a city 240 in a mile away , where the soil is better . For the nest maintenance 
every morning , they fly 240 in a farm . 
And every night , they fly 240 in a row . 
Back . They go back . Because they do yesterday &apos;s white line , the A92 highway , you can follow . 
In earnest . 
I had a very kind of journey , the penguins . So , I looked at Miguel . 
I said Miguel , &quot; Fly 240 kilometers to fly . &quot; The farm and fly them then , you know ? 240 kilometers back . AM Evening 
, you do that for the kids . He looked at me when 
he looked at me as if I had just heard Whitney Houston quote a song . 
He said , &quot; No , you do that because the food is better . &quot; 
I have not the skin of my lover &apos;s fish mentioned . The delicious was , and I like no skin of fish . I like it , not . Sauces me , I don &apos;t like it . Crispy , 
it &apos;s this biting , charred taste . 
I cook almost never with it . And 
yet , when I put it in this restaurant in southern Spain , I tried it at all , it didn &apos;t taste for fish skin . 
It tasted sweet . And it tasted pure as if you had a bite from the ocean . 
I mentioned that opposite Miguel . And he nodded . 
He said , &quot; The skin looks like a sponge . 
&quot; She &apos;s the last defense . Before anything happens in the body , 
she has become in the course of evolution , evolved to detect impurities and suck in , 
and then he added , &quot; But our water has no impurities , OK . &quot; 
A farm . The ones that don &apos;t feed their fish . A farm . The ones that measure their success in the success of their predators , 
and then I realized . If it says , &quot; A farm that doesn &apos;t have impurities , it undermines enormous . &quot; Because that water , which is through that farm , comes from the river Guadalquivir in the river . 
It &apos;s a river that has all of the things to do with it . It &apos;s rivers that are now prone to do with them . Chemical pollutants , outflow of pesticides 
and when it &apos;s through the river system , it &apos;s struggling with it , and it &apos;s leaving , the water is cleaner than it &apos;s come in . 
That system is so healthy . It cleans the water . 
So , not only a farm that &apos;s cleaning its animals , it &apos;s not feeding their animals . It &apos;s not just a farm that &apos;s successful in health , but also in measuring its success in the predators &apos; health , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water treatment plant . And not only for these fish , but also for you , too . And me , 
because if the water flows out , it sinks in the Atlantic , 
a drop in the ocean . I know , but I take it and I should take it , and you should . Because these love stories , romantic , whatever , are also revealing . 
You could say that they &apos;re a recipe , they &apos;re a recipe . They &apos;re going to be good food for the future , whether we &apos;re talking about meat or perch . 
What we &apos;re going to need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , of a concept in which food is . In fact , it tastes good . 
But for many people , that &apos;s a little bit too radical . 
We &apos;re not realists . We enjoy , we &apos;re lovers . 
We love weekly markets . We love little family businesses . We talk about regional food . We eat organic food , 
and if you claim that &apos;s what things are , the things that are the future of good food insurance . Someone somewhere on and says , &quot; Hey guys , I love pink . Flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ? &quot; 
How are you going to feed the world ? 
Can I honestly be honest . 
I like these questions , not . 
No . Not because we already have enough calories produced to make the world more than just to feed the world . 
One billion people will be hungry today . 
One billion . That &apos;s more than ever before . Because of stark inequalities in the distribution , not the total production . 
Now , I like this question , not because it &apos;s the logic of our food system , the last 50 years of it . 
Feed grain . Feed grains to vegetable eaters . Pesticides to monocultures , chemicals to ... The Earth chicken at fish and chicken at fish all the time , the agricultural industry just asked . If we want more people to feed cheaper , how horrible can that be ? That 
was the reason . It was the justification . It was the business plan of the American agriculture . 
We should feed them . What they are is a business in liquidation . A business that &apos;s quick to use environmental capital . That &apos;s exactly that production that allows , 
that &apos;s not a business . And it &apos;s not agriculture . 
Our grain chamber is threatened today . It &apos;s not because of decreasing supply , but because of decreasing resources , 
not the latest Moravian lawners . And tractor inventions , but because of fertile land , not by pumps , but by fresh water . Not by chainsaws , but by forests . And not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea . They 
want to make the world feed . Let &apos;s 
let &apos;s start with the question of , how are we going to feed ourselves ? 
Or better ? How can we create conditions ? The conditions that enable each community to self @-@ feed to feed that 
to do . Look at this . Don &apos;t look at the agricultural industrial model for the future . 
It &apos;s really old . And it &apos;s done . 
Capital , chemistry . And machines are in it on top , and it never has anything really good . To eat , look at it . 
Instead , we look at the ecological model . 
That &apos;s the one that &apos;s on two billion years of work experience . Look at it , Miguel . 
Farmers like Miguel , farms . The ones 
that don &apos;t exist are farms that restore themselves . Instead of using up farms that grow extensively , instead of just intensive farmers , who not only are producers , but are experts in relationships . 
Because they are the ones who are experts for taste , too . 
And if I really honestly am honest , they are a better cook than I am , ever being , ever . 
You know , that &apos;s right for me . Because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious . 
Thank you . 
I grew up with a lot of science fiction . 
In my school days , I drove . I grew up by bus to school every day . A hour per way . And my 
nose stuck always in my nose in a book , a science fiction book . That &apos;s my thoughts into other worlds that kidnapped me . And on narrative terms , my deep into me , insatiable , insatiable curiosity 
satisfied me . These curiosity showed up as well in the fact that whenever I was not in the world of school , I was always straying through the woods . And rehearsals collected frogs . And snakes . And beetle And pond water , everything brought home . And under the microscope , 
I looked at , I was totally science @-@ excited . 
You know , it was always going on , trying to get the world to understand . And the limits of what could be done , 
and my love of science fiction seemed to be in my environment reflected . Because back then , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon . And we explored the deep sea . 
Jacques Cousteau came to our living rooms with his fascinating shows , which we had animals . And places and a world full of wonders , showing us the wonders we never would have imagined before . 
This has then probably got very good at that science fiction role . 
And I was an artist . 
I could draw . I could paint 
and I could paint , and because it &apos;s neither video games nor this saturation with computer @-@ generated films , nor the whole visual language . In the media landscape , I had to give the pictures in my head . 
That had to be what we all had at the time . If we were kids , we had to read a book , we took the author &apos;s description and projected it . It was taken on the canvas in our heads . 
My reaction to that was drawing . And painting was aliens . Aliens worlds , robots , spacecraft and all of that . 
What in math class did I get constantly taught by the teacher ? 
How did I get hidden in the textbook , and creativity had to sort of get out of it . 
And in doing so , something interesting happened . What struck me about Jacques Cousteaus was shows that I was fascinated by the idea of a totally unknown world . Here , on our planet . Even certainly , 
I would never ever have an alien world with an spaceship , I would never reach . That seemed to me to be pretty unlikely . 
But here was a world that was me , actually , able to enter . Here , on Earth . And you know , it was just as fascinating . And exotic as all of that . What I was always imagining was what I had imagined when I read these books . 
So , I decided when I was 15 , when I was a diver . 
That only problem with this was that I was in a small village in Canada , living in 1,000 kilometers from the nearest ocean , 1,000 miles away . 
Of this , I left myself . But not discouraged . 
I was annoyed by my father until he finally got a diving school in Buffalo , New York , to find out . It was right on the other side of the border where we lived . 
I made my diving certificate in a pool that was in the middle of winter in Buffalo , New York . 
The ocean . But one real ocean got me . I got only two years later to see it . When we went to California 
since then , in the 40 years since , which have passed , I &apos;ve got about 3,000 hours under water underwater , and I &apos;ve been living in the ocean for a few years . 500 hours of that in submersible boats , 
and I &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea itself is in the flatter oceans . So rich in fascinating life , it &apos;s as rich as we really hardly imagine it . The imagination of 
nature knows no one &apos;s limits , unlike anything else we own , miserable human imagination . 
Until the present day , I still feel the deepest awe for what I have to say on my dives . 
And my love for the ocean keeps on with the same intensity . Like ever . 
And ever since I was then , as an adult , an adult , I chose a job , it was filmmaking . 
That seemed to be the best way to make my inner urge to tell stories . With my need to take pictures , 
to combine them as a child , to draw . I was constantly drawing comic books , and so films were the way . 
Pictures and stories were the way to bring together , and that fit . Together . 
Of course , the stories I was telling were the stories I chose from the science fiction field , Terminator Aliens . And 
Abyss at Abyss could I do my preference for the love of the underwater world and diving with filmmaking . 
So , the intertwined , kind of , my two passions . 
Something interesting happened at Abyss to get a narrative problem in the context of this movie to solve . And that was , we had to sort of have a liquid water system created , attacked . We were looking at computer @-@ generated animation CG . 
What &apos;s coming out of this was the first computer @-@ generated soft surface figure . The ever @-@ in @-@ a @-@ movie character 
that was shown , the film didn &apos;t bring money , and in fact it played . It just played its production costs , right ? But he noticed something fascinating . That audience on the whole world was a bit hypnotized . It was a magic that 
was thought to have been , according to Arthur Clarke &apos;s law , advanced technology and magic are no longer to be distinguished . 
They saw , then , something magical . 
And that found me incredibly exciting . 
And I thought , &quot; Wow , that absolutely must be into the art of film . So 
they went to Terminator 2 , my next movie . &quot; Still a lot further along 
with ILM , they created . We made the guy there from liquid metal , the success was hanging . Very much of that . AB : How this effect would arrive ? 
And it worked . Again , we had something magical created . And the effect in the audience was the same . But there we have with the film already a little bit more money we &apos;ve been recording 
from these two experiences . So starting with this , a whole new world was reached . A whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for filmmakers . 
So , I started a company together with my good friend , Stan . Winston , who was at that time the best make @-@ up and creature designer , called Digital Domain . 
The basic idea of this company was to start the phase of analog processes with optical printers , etc . , and jump over to digital productions and start doing it right away . 
And so we did . And we did , and we did , for a while , 
a competitive advantage . But in the mid @-@ 1990s , we realized that we had a creature and character design , what we were doing for the company , which we actually founded . 
And too slowly , I had this piece of Avatar written . That was the bar in visual terms . And computer @-@ generated effects , all at new heights , was supposed to push with realistic human expressive characters . The ones using CG made were CG @-@ based , and the main characters were supposed to be CG @-@ shaped . And the world was supposed to be CG . 
But the bar pressed very nicely . And the people in my company , they told me that we were still not in the company for the time being . That &apos;s how to do it , so it shifted . 
I shifted that , and I did this other movie about the big ship . 
That goes down to the studio , I got that as Romeo and Juliet on a ship , and I sold it to the studio . It became a love movie of epic proportions , a passionate film 
, in secret . But did I actually want to become a real wreck ? The Titanic , diving 
down , so I made the film . 
That &apos;s the truth . That studio knew that . But not me . 
I have it . But convinced by being saying , &quot; We dive to the wreck . &quot; We film that real wreck . 
We &apos;re going to do it in the opening sequence of the film . 
That &apos;s tremendous . It &apos;s a good trailer for the marketing . And 
I persuaded them to make an expedition to finance . 
Sounds crazy . But that can be done again . That &apos;s because the one &apos;s imagination is a reality that 
can create . We created then actually six months . Six months later , a reality where I got into a Russian submersible boat , a reality that I found myself in . Four kilometers below the surface of the North Atlantic and myself , the real Titanic , through a bullet . That was 
not a movie . No HD . That was real . 
So , that got me really bypassed . 
And the preparations for that were enormous . We had to have cameras and headlights and everything and everything . 
And I fell on how much I noticed these deep @-@ sea dive gears resembling a space mission . 
Well , you were also highly technical . And they needed extensive planning . 
You go up into this capsule . Then you float in this dark dark , hostile environment , where there &apos;s no hope of salvation . If you do not , you don &apos;t , yourself , get back , 
and I thought , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s the same as if I were in a science fiction movie . 
&quot; That &apos;s real cool . I 
was pretty obsessed with exploring . I was obsessed with deep sea . Anyway , 
of the part that &apos;s curious and science about . It was all . It was adventure . It was curiosity . It was imagination . 
And it was a real experience that I had not had Hollywood to give me . 
Because , you know , I could get a creature for myself to imagine , and then we could create a visual effect . But I could get no idea what that was that I was outside the window , what I was going to see . 
And for some of the expeditions that followed , I &apos;ve got to see beings in thermal springs . And sometimes things that I still see before , things I &apos;d never seen before . Sometimes also things that are still at all things that nobody had ever seen before . And for those who are science &apos;s at the time we saw them . Still , none 
of the words found were words . So that really turned me around . And I wanted more 
and so , so I met a couple of unusual decisions . 
After that success , after Titanic , I said , &quot; Okay . I want to do my main job as a filmmaker . &quot; In Hollywood , on ice and in Hollywood , I &apos;m going to be a full @-@ time researcher for a while . And 
then they started to expeditions , and we started planning them . 
We showed up to Bismarck . And we explored them with robotic vehicles . 
We returned to the wreck . The Titanic , back . 
We took little robots , which we built , and we took them . The ones that ran a fiberglass cable , 
and our intention was to dive in . And we got inside the ship . And we looked at what never has been done before . 
Nobody had ever had the inside of the wreck explored . You had another one , you had no means of doing that . So we developed the necessary technology . 
So , what ? And there I am now sitting on the deck . The Titanic . In a submersible boat , and I see planks planking these boards here that are quite similar . And from those I know are those that once the band there played , 
And I fly with a little bit of robotic vehicle through the aisles of the ship . 
I operate it , actually , only , but my consciousness is within the vehicle . 
It felt like it was like the way I was physically inside the ship wreck of the Titanic . 
That was the surreal form of a déjà vu . The one I &apos;ve ever experienced , because before I was each around a corner , I knew I &apos;d always . What &apos;s going to happen in the light cone of the vehicle , because I walked over the movie set for months . When we walked the film , 
the set was actually a set , a precise copy of the ship &apos;s blueprints . 
That was , then , a very strange experience . 
It made me this telepresence experience conscious that you could have such robotic avatars . And so , your own consciousness in that vehicle , into that other form . The existence of 
that can be laid , it was really incredibly profound . 
And maybe it was also a little bit of a look at it . That which might be in a few decades , perhaps . If you could have cyborg bodies to do some research or other things to do . In all sorts of post @-@ human future scenarios that I think I can imagine as a science fiction fan . 
After these expeditions , we started doing what we were down there , what we had seen . Really ? Estimate to learn . Learn , for example , these deep @-@ sea equals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . This is sort of alien . But here on Earth . 
They live with the help of chemosynthesis . 
They exist not in a species that is based on sunlight . How do we do this 
? And so this is how you see animals right next to a 500 degrees centigrade . Hot water cloud live . And 
you can live . And you can &apos;t imagine they survive there . 
To the same time , I was also very interested in space science . That was again the science fiction influence from my childhood . 
And so it landed with me , people who were interested in the space world . And the people with NASA , at the same time , and at the NASA expert council , and they &apos;re planning real space missions . They &apos;re going to Russia . They &apos;re going through before the mission , the biomedical protocol , and all the drum and drum flying . Then to the International Space Station , and they &apos;re taking our 3D camera systems . 
That was fascinating . 
But at the end of the day , it was that I was going to be a space scientist with us in the deep sea . 
I was going to take them and I was going to give them access to the world . And down there , astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were working on these extreme situations . I was going to take them to the sources so they could look around , take samples and test instruments . And so on . 
We turned , well , documentaries were being made , but actually science . More specifically , space science , 
so the circle between my circle of existence as a science fiction fan closed . Back then , when I was a kid and I was a reality . 
In the course of this discovery journey , I learned a lot . 
I learned a lot about science , a lot . But I learned a lot about science , too . 
Now , think about leadership , I &apos;m sure a director must be able to lead . A leader must be like a ship captain or something . 
I understood , but I didn &apos;t understand much about leadership . Before I started these expeditions , 
because I was on a certain point , I had to tell myself , &quot; What am I doing ? &quot; Actually , here . 
Why are I doing this ? What &apos;s going to come out of this ? These 
stupid movies bring us no more money . A &quot; We Play 
Just &quot; -- the production cost . A one of fame , no trace . 
Everybody thinks , I &apos;m between Titanic and Avatar . Walked away and would have somewhere else the nails on a towel on the beach . 
I &apos;ve all got these movies . These documentary films for a very small audience made . 
No fame , no honor . No money . What are you doing ? 
You &apos;re doing it around the task for the sake of the challenge . And the ocean is the most challenging environment that it has . You &apos;re doing it of exploratory noise . Because of and because of the strange connection that emerges when a little group of people are creating a team . 
Because we have all of this with just 10 to 12 percent people , and we &apos;ve done it . The years of continuous collaboration , sometimes they &apos;ve been two to three months in a row at sea . 
And in this community , you can see that the most important thing is respect , respect , that you have for each other . Because you have a task to do . The one you don &apos;t know anyone else can explain 
when you return to land . And you say , &quot; We had to do it . &quot; That fiberglass , the sound attenuation . And that &apos;s all around . The whole technology . And the difficulties . That human power . If you look at sea , you can work at sea , you can &apos;t explain that to others . That &apos;s like the policemen or policemen , or soldiers who do something in common . And you know they do never do it to 
explain anyone . There &apos;s a connection . There &apos;s 
mutual respect when I do come back to my next movie , Avatar , to try to make the same leadership style , which is that you respect your team . And you get in return for the respect that it deserves , 
and that really changed the dynamics . 
Because there I was , again , with a small team , unknown terrain . We turned Avatar with a new one , technology that it used to be , and it didn &apos;t exist before . 
It was incredibly exciting , 
it was a tremendous challenge . 
And we became , for a period of four and a half years , a real family . 
And so this changed my way of making films . 
It completely changed . There were people who thought we had these ocean properties , really good @-@ done , and we were transporting them to Pandora . For 
me , it was more of a principled way of doing my job . The real process of doing this is the result of what has changed . 
So what can we do about all of this ? 
What lessons do we have ? We learned . 
I believe in first place , the curiosity is . 
It &apos;s the most powerful human property . Our 
imagination is a force that is even a reality that creates a reality . 
And the respect for your team is more important than all laurels . This world to 
me comes with young filmmakers . The people who say , &quot; Give me a advice like me . &quot; So this is how to do this . And 
I say , &quot; Don &apos;t limit yourself . 
&quot; A , &quot; Get this . &quot; Other people for you . &quot; Do not do it for you . &quot; &quot; Self bet , not against yourself . &quot; But take risks . Take risks . 
NASA has . So , a favorite sentence : Failure is not an alternative . But 
in the arts and in the exploration , failure must be an alternative . Because there , it guarantees a benefit of trust . 
No important undertaking . That innovation demanded was ever realized without risk . 
You have to be ready . Such risks on 
your own . That &apos;s the idea that I thought to you with on your own . Failure is quite a way of thinking . Fear . But is not thank you . 
If I can tell you one thing today , it &apos;s a way of bringing together all the data that we consume , that &apos;s greater than the sum of your parts . And instead of doing that , instead of thinking about overloading information , I want you to think about how we are information . So , how we can use patterns to create patterns . And we can use them to identify trends that otherwise have not become visible . 
So , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical death chart based on age . 
That program , which I &apos;m using here , is a little experiment . 
It &apos;s called Pivot . And what I &apos;m doing with Pivot is what I can do after a certain cause of death filter . Say , accidents . 
And immediately , I see another one pattern . This is what emerges , 
and that &apos;s because in the middle , here , people are most active . And they &apos;re over here , most frail . 
We can have a step further out and sort it out . The data , then , refresh and see that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects . But not for everyone . 
If we now go further and look at age , we say 40 years or younger or younger , we see that accidents , even the main cause , are the ones that people worry about . 
And who &apos;s going to study , you see that this is particularly true for men . 
They recognize , therefore , that reputation for information and data is in this way very much related to swimming . In a living information graph , 
and if we remember this for raw data , why can &apos;t we do this for content ? 
Even what we &apos;re doing here now is the cover images . Everybody , every single Sports Illustrated , who has ever been printed . 
It &apos;s all here . It &apos;s all online . 
It &apos;s all online . You can test it after my talk in your rooms . 
With Pivot , you can dive into a decade . 
You can dive in , into , for a certain year . 
You can dive directly to , for a certain issue . 
If I &apos;m here to look , I see the athletes , who are in this issue . And the sports , 
I &apos;m a Lance Armstrong fan . So click on here . What &apos;s causing me all the issues to show Lance Armstrong in which I &apos;m mentioned ? 
Now , if I just look at a bigger picture , I could think . OK . What if I wanted to get all of this about cycling ? So 
I &apos;m going to take a step back . And I &apos;m going to expand the perspective . 
Now , I &apos;m going to see Greg Lemon , 
and so you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , more targeted , wider , more pure , zoom out , you don &apos;t look for it or surf . You don &apos;t just look at it . Just 
you do something . That &apos;s actually a little different . Is 
it something in between ? And we think it changes the way it changes the way it changes the way information can be used . 
I want to share this idea now a little bit more . With about what a little bit crazy is , 
what we &apos;re doing here is we &apos;re having every single wikipedia page taken . And they &apos;re going to take you down to a little summary . 
The summary contains a short overview of this . And a symbol of the range of the area from which it comes from , 
I &apos;m just going to show you the top 500 of the most popular wikipedia pages . 
But even in this limited view , you can see a lot of things . 
Immediately , we get an idea of the topics . The ones on Wikipedia are most popular , 
I &apos;m going to move on to government . 
Now , after I &apos;ve elected government , I realize that the Wikipedia categories that are on the most cover are Time Magazines , people of the year . 
This is really important . Because this is a realization that is not in a single individual Wikipedia page . 
This is just too recognizable . If you want to go one step back and look at the whole thing , 
looking at one of these summaries . I can then go into the subject of Time Magazines , &quot; People of the Year . &quot; Go and everybody together . 
See , if I now see all these people , I realize that the majority of them are government officials . Some of them come from science . Some of them come from even less business . Here &apos;s my boss . And one comes from the music sector . 
And interestingly , Bono is also a TED Prize winner . 
So you can now jump . And you can take a look at all the TED Prize winners . 
You can see we surf the web . That first time , as if it &apos;s really a web network , not just from the side to the side , but much more abstract . 
And so , I want to show you something else . What a little surprise is . Could 
I show you here just just just the New York City Times website ? 
Pivot , this application . I want it not to be a browser . It &apos;s really not a browser . But you can do websites with it . And we bring these zoom technology to you . Everybody , every single website . How this ? 
I can do it a step back . And right back to a specific section , jump . 
That &apos;s why it &apos;s important because you can only look through looking at websites in this way and look at them all over the Internet , and in the same way , look at it . 
I can , therefore , go back into my course , zoom in in in a certain 
time frame . Here &apos;s the state of the whole demonstration . The one I &apos;ve kept up to this point , 
and I can sort of do everything I &apos;ve seen so far . Again , bring 
back , and when I take a step out again , and look at everything , I can refresh my course . Maybe after my search past . Here &apos;s where I &apos;ve been looking for nepotistic . Here &apos;s Bing , or Here &apos;s live labs : Pivot . 
And from here , I can go into the page . And you can go back to 
it . It &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s always coming to use . And every time it does that , it does the overall picture . Bigger than the sum of the data pieces 
at the moment , in this world . Think about it , data is a curse . 
We talk about it . Curse of the abundance of information . 
We talk about drowning in information . 
What if we could get this situation going ? And that Internet on the head . Imagine this so that instead of always being led from one to the other . Start from many things to the other . Thank you . Go to many things . And by doing this , you can see patterns that would otherwise have been hidden . 
If we could do this , then it will be this data trap that we &apos;ve had so far . Maybe a new source of meaningful information . 
And instead of just just looking at information , you can just move around and get knowledge from it . 
And if we know , then then you can maybe even experience wisdom from it . 
So that &apos;s what I stop . Thank you . 
Everybody talks today about the happiness of happiness . 
I have some people who have the number of books . Let &apos;s have the number of books with happiness in the title in the last five years . And they gave up after about 40 , right ? And it was still a lot more . 
It &apos;s a huge wave of the interest in happiness among the researchers . 
It &apos;s very , very happy coaching . 
Everybody would like to see people happier . 
But despite all of this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps . The ones that , it &apos;s kind of , make it almost impossible . Sure . About happiness , thinking about happiness . 
And my talk . Today , the main thing that &apos;s happening today is these cognitive traps . 
That &apos;s the case for laymen . The ones who talk about their own happiness . And it &apos;s the case for scientists who think about happiness because happiness turns out we &apos;re exactly the same mess . How everyone else who &apos;s 
the first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity . 
It turns out it &apos;s the same word happiness that &apos;s just not a useful word anymore because we &apos;re putting it on too many different things , too . 
I think it &apos;s a certain one meaning on which we apply it to , you know ? But in the big picture , it &apos;s something that we can give up , you know . And we &apos;re going to take the complicated view . That &apos;s what well @-@ being is , 
the second case . Is it a confusion of experience ? And memory in fact is it &apos;s between happiness , you know ? In his life and happiness , you know , about his life or happiness . With his life 
and that &apos;s what two are very different concepts and they are both different , they &apos;re thrown together . In the idea of happiness and happiness 
and the third is the concentration illusion . And that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that the fact is that we don &apos;t think about one thing . The well @-@ being affects without its meaning distorting . 
I mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive trap . 
It &apos;s just not a way . It &apos;s right to get it right . 
Now , I &apos;d like to talk to you about an example of someone who had a question and answer session . After a one of my lectures , which told a story , unclear , he said he had heard a symphony . And it was absolutely magnificent . ( Music ) And at the very end of the recording , there was a terrible , creeping sound . 
And then , he added , &quot; Really , quite emotional . &quot; That &apos;s what all the experience has ruined . 
But that had it not . 
What it ruined had been the sound memories of the experience . 
He had the experience . 
He had 20 minutes . Great music . 
You counted not because he had to deal with a memory . The memory was ruined . And the memory was everything . What he did to keep it was 
what we had really got , and what that really tells us is that we talked about ourselves and about other people . In the sense of two kinds of self , 
there &apos;s one surviving self . That &apos;s what &apos;s alive in the present , and the present knows is capable of the past . Again , experiencing . But in fact , just the present has 
it . It &apos;s the living self . That &apos;s what the doctor is acclaimed . You know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Is it hurting now ? &quot; When I ask you to touch you here , 
and then there &apos;s a memory self . And that memory self is that memory self that &apos;s widening . And the story of our lives , maintaining . And it &apos;s that that which is the doctor &apos;s addressing by telling you the question of , &quot; How did you last have felt or felt like ? &quot; 
Or , &quot; What was your journey to Albania or something like that ? 
&quot; This is two very different units , very different . This living self and this memory @-@ self . And the two to confuse is to be part of the union of the term happiness . 
Now , the memory self is a storyteller . 
And that starts really with a real fundamental reaction to our own memories . It starts immediately . 
We tell not only stories . When we think about it , stories become stories , 
our memory tells us stories . That means what we &apos;re talking about from our experiences is what we &apos;re allowed to keep is a story . 
And let &apos;s not forget about it with an example . 
It &apos;s a old study . 
That &apos;s real patients . That &apos;s one that &apos;s undergoing a painful procedure , and 
I &apos;m not going to go into detail . You know , it &apos;s no longer painful today . But you know , it was painful . When these studies were done in the 1990s , 
they became real patients , and they were asked to report their pain every 60 seconds . And 
here &apos;s two patients . That &apos;s their records . 
And they &apos;re asked , who of both has more suffered from both ? And 
that &apos;s a very simple one . 
Patient B has clearly more suffered from this . His intestinal reflection was longer . And each minute of pain , the patient A had had had patient B and more and more . 
But now there are a different one : How much did these patients think that they suffered and here they suffered , 
and here &apos;s a surprise ? And 
the surprise is that patient is patient A , much worse reminder of the intestinal reflection , had . When patient B , 
the stories of intestinal reflections , were different , and because a very critical part of the story is . How they end 
and not one of these stories is very edifical . Or great . But one of them is this one that is clear . But one of them is clear . Worse than the other is clear . 
And the ones that are worse was the one where the pain was all at the end of its peak . It &apos;s a bad story . 
Where do we know that ? 
Because we have these people after they &apos;re reflecting their intestinal reflections . And also , much later . How bad was the whole thing ? Overall , 
and it was much worse for A than for A than for B in memory . 
Now , that &apos;s a direct conflict between the survivor himself , right ? And that memory self 
from the point of view of the survivor himself , B had clearly a worse time . 
Now , what you do with patient A was , and we have actually clinical experiments , we &apos;ve done . And it &apos;s done . And it works . You could actually do the intestinal reflection of patient A by extending it simply by just putting the tube inside without having to be too much at it . 
That &apos;s going to make it happen that the patient suffers , but only a little bit less than before . 
And if you do that a few minutes , you have a few effects on the effect that the living self of patient A gets worse off . And you have a effect on the memory self of patient , patient A , getting much better off . Because now , you have patient A , getting a better story about your experience . 
What makes you draw a story from ? 
And that &apos;s true of the stories that the memory tells us . And it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent . 
What makes a story unique is that upheavals are significant moments and ends . 
End is very , very important . And in this case , the dominant end was end . 
Now , the living self lives its life continuously . 
It has moments of experience , a moment after moment . 
And they ask what happens to what happens to these moments ? 
And the answer is really simple : They &apos;re for ever lost . 
I mean , most moments of our lives and I have lost that , of all things . They know , psychological presence is true as something like three seconds long . What does knowledge mean ? Do you know that in a life it &apos;s about 600 million of them . In a month , there &apos;s something like 600,000 , most of them , leaving behind . No trace . 
The majority of them are completely uncovered . Of the memory self , 
and yet , somehow , they get the impression that they should count , that what &apos;s going to happen during these moments of experience . Our lives are 
it . It &apos;s the limited resource that we consume . While we &apos;re on this world , 
and how we use it , it would be . It seems important . But that &apos;s not the story . The one that reminds the self for us . 
So , we have the remembering self . And that living self . And they are really pretty different . 
The biggest difference between them is that they deal with time , 
from the point of view of the living . Even if they do a vacation , and they have a second week just as good , as the first . Then there &apos;s the two @-@ week vacation twice as good as the one @-@ week vacation . So 
that &apos;s how it works . It doesn &apos;t work at all for the memory . Even 
for the memory self , it &apos;s a two @-@ week vacation . Hardly better than the one @-@ week holiday , because there &apos;s no new memories added . 
They have the story , not changed . 
And on those terms , time is . Actually , the critical variable that a memory self distinguishes from the memory self from a living self has time . Very little influence on these stories . 
Now , the memory self makes more than just remembering . And stories about telling . 
It &apos;s actually the one . That decision makes , because if you make a patient who has a patient who , let &apos;s say , has two intestinal reflections with two different surgeons . And it decides which one to choose . Should then be , is the one who chooses the one who has the memory , who is less bad ? And that &apos;s the surgeon , the one who will be selected . 
That survivor himself has no voice , in this choice . Actually , 
we don &apos;t choose between experiences . We choose between memories of experiences , 
and even experiences . When we think about the future , we think about our memories of our future . Normally not as experiences . We think about our future , after . When 
we think about our future , as anticipated memories , 
and basically you can look at that . You know , as a tyranny of remembering self . And you can imagine that remembering self is . Think as one , which is , so to speak , dragging the living self through experiences that the living self doesn &apos;t need . 
I have the impression that if you think about vacation , that &apos;s very often the case , that means . We make holidays as much as possible in the service of the memory . Even 
and that &apos;s a little bit hard to justify . Think I . 
I mean , how much tiring . We from our memories , 
that &apos;s a one of the explanations that are for dominance of memory self given to memory self . 
And if I talk about that , I think about a vacation , which we &apos;re going to spend a few years ago in Antarctica . The one that &apos;s clearly the best vacation I &apos;ve ever had was . And I think relatively often about that in relation to how much time I think about other vacations , 
and I think I probably heard about my memories of it . These three @-@ week trips . I would say something like 25 minutes long in the last few four years . 
Drilled . Now , if I ever ever had the folder opened with the 600 images in it , I would have another hour spent . 
Now , these are three weeks . And that &apos;s at most one and a half hours . 
There seems to be disagreement there . 
Now , I like a little extreme . You know , in that , how little appetite ? I &apos;m looking for feeding memories . But even if you &apos;re more of it , there &apos;s a real question . Why are we giving memories ? So much weight . In the scourge of weight . That we experience . That &apos;s 
why I want you to talk about a thought experiment . So 
imagine what you &apos;re going to do next vacation . You know that on the end of your vacation , all your images are destroyed . And you get a amnesty drug . That &apos;s how you get nowhere . Remember nothing . 
Now , you would have the same vacation . And if you had another vacation , you would have a different vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two kinds of self . And you have to think about how you &apos;re going to decide this conflict . And that &apos;s really , really not obvious at all . Because if you &apos;re going to be in the sense of time , you get an answer . And if you &apos;re in the sense of memory , you could think of another answer , you could get a different one . 
Why ? We , the vacations , choose . The ones we choose is a problem . That &apos;s what we face with a choice between the two , with a choice of self . 
Now , the two types of self throw two terms from the happiness : 
It &apos;s actually two concepts of self @-@ happiness . The ones we can apply are one per self . 
They can , therefore , ask how happy is . That living self . 
And then they would ask , how happy are the moments of happiness in the life of the living being ? Even 
and they are all happiness . For moments . Is a pretty complicated one ? Process . 
Which are the emotions ? The ones that can be measured ? 
And by the way , we are now able to have a pretty good idea . From happiness , the living self , to time . 
When you look after happiness , the memory self , is it the happiness of the memory self , it &apos;s a very different thing . 
That &apos;s not about it . How happy a person lives . 
It &apos;s about how satisfied or how pleased . The person is when that person is about his or her life . 
Very different terms . 
Everybody who thinks about these terms doesn &apos;t differentiate will study the study of happiness . And I belong to a lot of happiness researchers , about well @-@ being . The people who study happiness for a long time have masked up on this very way , 
the distinction between happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness . And the happiness of memory self . It &apos;s been recognized in recent years that . And now , you &apos;re trying to make the two separate measurements , 
the Gallup Organization , has a global survey of the two , where more than half a million people have been asked questions . And what they &apos;re asking about their lives . Think about and think about their experiences . And it was other efforts in the process of doing that . 
In the last few years , we &apos;ve started to think about happiness , the happiness of the two kinds of self . 
And the main lesson that we have , I think , learned is that they really do differ from one another . 
They can know how satisfied someone is with their lives . And that teaches them really doesn &apos;t teach them much . That &apos;s how happy he is . Life lives . And vice versa . 
Only to give you an idea of the correlation to the correlation . The correlation is about five . 
What that means is that if you &apos;re somebody you would meet and you would meet them , &quot; Oh , his father is a two @-@ meter man . &quot; How much would you know about his height ? You know , 
well , you &apos;d know something about his size . You know , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty . 
You have that much uncertainty . 
If I give you a message that someone is going to spend their life as eight on a scale of 10 . Have you got a lot of uncertainty about that ? How happy he is with his life survivor ? 
Even the correlation is , therefore , low . 
We know something about what the correlation is about happiness self happiness . 
We know that money is very important , goals are very , very important . 
We know that happiness is essentially about happiness , being satisfied with people who we like , time to spend . With people who we like , 
it &apos;s other pleasure . But that &apos;s dominant . 
If you &apos;re doing happiness , then , for the two kinds of self to maximize , you will end up with very different things . The conclusion from 
the conclusion of what I said here is that what we &apos;re doing is that happiness really shouldn &apos;t be imagined . When you replace happiness with well @-@ being , 
it &apos;s a completely different term . 
Now , very briefly . A different reason for that is why we don &apos;t know clearly about happiness is that happiness is not something that we &apos;re not paying attention to . When we talk about life , when we think about life , and when we actually live 
, when you ask the simple question of how happy people in California are , they &apos;re not going to be given the right answer . 
When they do that question , they think they &apos;re people who are in California happier . When they say , &quot; We &apos;re living in Ohio , &quot; 
and what happens is that when they talk about life in California , they think about life difference between the California and other places . And this difference is , say , in climate . 
Now , it turns out that it &apos;s climate not very important for climate to the living self . And it &apos;s not even very important , even for the thoughtful . Even that decides how happy people are . 
Now , because that thoughtful self is responsible , the thoughtful self can eventually lead some people to be . AM : End up moving to California , 
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track . What happens to people ? The ones to move to California , hoping to be happier , 
Well , their self @-@ living is not going to be happier . 
We know that . 
But one thing is going to happen . You &apos;re going to think you &apos;re happier . Because if you talk about that , you &apos;re reminded that you &apos;re terrible . That weather in Ohio was , and you &apos;re going to feel that you &apos;re making the right decision . 
It &apos;s very difficult , clear about well @-@ being . And I hope I have to tell you an idea of that , how difficult it is . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question for you . 
You &apos;re very grateful . 
Well , when we started thinking a few weeks ago , when we were talking to me , you told me that it was a pretty interesting result . That was from this Gallup survey . 
Is that something that was what you &apos;re participating in ? Let &apos;s be because you can now have a few minutes left . 
Daniel Kahneman : Sure . 
I think that &apos;s the most interesting result . That we have in the Gallup survey . It &apos;s a number that we had absolutely not expected to find . 
We found that in terms of the number of happiness of the survivor himself . 
If we look at how feelings are connected to income , we look at how feelings vary , 
and it turns out that under an income of 60,000 dollars a year , Americans are . And that &apos;s a very large , big sample of Americans . About 600 000 . But it &apos;s a big representative . Under one income of 600 000 , 000 dollars a year . 
CA : 60,000 . 
DK : 60,000 , 
60,000 , 60,000 dollars a year , are people unhappy ? And they &apos;re getting increasingly unhappy . JE : The poorer they get about it . 
We , an absolutely flat line . 
I mean , I rarely think I have such flat lines seen . 
What happens is obviously that money is giving you no experience of happiness . But that lack of money gives you a certain amount of misery . And we can get this misery very , very clearly measured . 
In the sense of the other , even the remembering self , you get a different story . 
The more money you make , the more satisfied you are . 
That &apos;s not true of emotions . 
CA : But Danny , throughout the American endeavor , it &apos;s about life . Freedom , the aspiration for happiness . 
If people want to be serious about this finding , I mean , it seems . Everything on the head . Everything that we believe to be , for example , in tax policy and so on . 
Is there a chance that politicians will have that country in general , a finding like the seriousness of the finding ? And that &apos;s based on that , would make politics . 
DK : You know , I think there &apos;s recognition for the role of gambling research in politics . 
The recognition is slowly going to be . In the United States , no question . But in the United Kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now . And in other countries , it &apos;s happening right now . The 
people are in the process of recognizing that they think of happiness . If you think about politics , 
it &apos;s going to take a while . And it &apos;s going to be people who will discuss whether they want to explore experience happiness . Or whether they want to explore life assessment . So , we need to have this discussion . Quite soon , 
how to lead happiness increases , you know ? Go very differently . Depending on how you think . And whether you think about the memory self , or whether you think about the living self , or whether you think about the living self . 
That &apos;s what will influence politics . Think about it . In the coming years , 
in the United States , you &apos;re going to be tightening on the happiness of the people . 
That &apos;s going to , I think , be the next one or two decades , part of the national statistics . 
CA : Well , it seems to me , this is a subject that &apos;s going to , or should , be at least the most interesting political debate to follow . About the next few years , 
many thanks . For the invention of behavioral economics . 
Thank you . Danny Kahneman : Today 
I &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate . 
And that &apos;s surprising . Maybe something because the reason my full @-@ time work at the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds , about things that we invent . And deliver . To provide to the poorest two billion , a better life for them . 
But energy and climate are extremely extreme , important . For these people , in fact , even more important than for everyone . For others on the planet , 
climate degradation means that their seeds are growing for many years to come . It means we &apos;re too much , or too little rain . The things are going to change that way . How it changes your fragile environment , how it can &apos;t stand . 
That leads to starvation . It leads to insecurity . It leads to unrest . 
So it becomes climate change terrible for you , you know . It &apos;s 
also the energy price for you . Very important . 
The fact is , if you &apos;re just talking about one thing , you could reduce the price , you &apos;d reduce poverty , energy would be by far the most effective . 
Now , the energy price is above time , down . In fact 
, the progress society is based on energy advances , which drove 
coal evolution , the industrial revolution . And even in the 20th century , there was a rapid fall in the electricity price , and so we have refrigerators , air conditioning . We can use modern materials . And so many things we do . 
We &apos;re here . So , in a wonderful situation , with electricity in the rich world . 
But if we do the price down , we let ourselves be the price halved , hit . We hit a new barrier and we hit this barrier with a CO2 barrier , 
CO2 warms up the planet . And the equation for CO2 is the actual pretty clear . 
It &apos;s summing up the CO2 emitted , which leads to temperature increase . And these temperature increases have some very negative consequences . Effects on the weather . And maybe worse , the indirect consequence is that the natural ecosystems are so rapid changes in the world that they cannot adapt . And so whole systems collapse . 
Now , the exact link between a CO2 increase and a CO2 increase in the resulting temperature change . And where their further consequences lie , because there are some of the ambiguities . But not very many . 
And there are certainly some ambiguities about how bad this impact is going to be . But they &apos;re going to be extremely bad . 
I have the top scientists asked several times , &quot; Do we really have to get down to near zero ? 
&quot; Is it not enough ? The half or the quarter , 
the answer is , until we get near zero , we get there . The temperature will keep rising . 
That &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge . 
It &apos;s quite different from what we say . We have a three and a half feet truck that &apos;s under a three @-@ meter bridge , and it &apos;s got to come here . It can be done , you know , squeezing 
it down . That &apos;s what has to be downward @-@ down to zero . 
Now , we hit zero every year . One lot of carbon dioxide out of over 26 billion tons . 
Every American , about 20 tons . People from poor countries , less than one in average 
, are the average , about five tons for everyone on the planet . 
And somehow , we need to create change . The ones that do that to zero . 
It &apos;s been constant up to 
now . Only different economic changes have made it even affect . And we need to be affected by rapid growth to reduction . And then to reduce to a reduction to zero . 
These equations have four factors . One bit of multiplication . They have this thing on the left , CO2 . That they &apos;re heading towards zero . And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be done by the number of people , by the services that every human being uses on average . The average energy for every service , for every service . And that CO2 . That per unit of energy emits 
is , let &apos;s leave everybody factor alone to look at . And think about how we can do that to zero . 
Probably , a single one of these numbers has to come very close to zero . Now , this is basic algebra . 
But go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and do it . By 
first , we &apos;ve got the population . 
Today , six to eight billion people live 
, and it &apos;s reaching nine billion . 
The ones that are going to nine billion . If we &apos;re very successful in new vaccines , new pre @-@ health vaccines and reproductive medicine , we might be able to do that by 10 to 15 percent . But to date , we &apos;re seeing a climb of 1.3 percent of 
the second factor is the services that we &apos;re using . That includes all of 
this . That &apos;s the food that we eat : Clothing , television , heating . 
These are very good things . And poverty reduction means these services almost to everyone on the planet accessible to everyone . 
It &apos;s great that these numbers are rising up 
in the rich world , in the upper billion , if we could probably make cuts . And less use , but on average , these numbers will be used every year . And they will be increasing overall , more than doubling the number of services per person per person that are provided . 
Here &apos;s where we see a very basic service : Is there a light at home ? So that you can read the homework 
and these students have these . It &apos;s not . So , they go out . And they read . Their school tasks . Under the street light . 
Now , effectiveness , the E , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news . 
We have something that &apos;s not going up . 
Because of different successes in the lighting sector , because of other types of cars , because of new methods . In building houses , there &apos;s a lot of services that have an energy consumption . They &apos;re drastically able to reduce them . 
Drastically reduced . 103 : 00 05 50 : 000 : GT : 00 05 : 53 : 000 : Some services : Let &apos;s go 90 percent down . Some individual services : Let &apos;s go 90 percent down . 
In others , services like manufacturing , manufacturing fertilizers 105 : 00 05 56 : 000 GT : 00 05 58 : 000 or air transport or air transport , the room for improvement is a lot smaller . 
Overall , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a reduction of maybe one factor three or maybe even a factor three , or maybe even a factor six . 
But in the first three factors , the first three are now 26 billion to maybe the very best 13 billion tons , or maybe the best . And that &apos;s 
just not enough . Look at the first three factors . And this is going to be a key factor . That &apos;s the amount of CO2 that we have per unit of energy emitted . 
It represents a number of questions as to whether you can do that to zero . 
If you &apos;re burning coal , no , 
if you &apos;re burning natural gas , no , 
almost every method of producing electricity . If you emit CO2 today , except for renewable energy , you emit CO2 . 
And nuclear energy , so what we do on a global scale , is a new one , a new system to 
create . We need energy under . 
If I &apos;m going to use the term &quot; wonder , &quot; I don &apos;t mean . That impossible of 
microprocessor is a microprocessor . The PC is a miracle . 
That Internet and its services are a miracle . 
The people here have become the ones who have evolved many of these miracles . 
Normally , there are no deadline for you to do a miracle up to a certain date . 
Normally , you &apos;re just standing next to it . And some people come not . In 
this case , we have to do full gas . And a miracle in very short order of time 
is getting , well , I wondered , how can I really get this over ? 
Is there a natural illustration ? Is there a demonstration that illustrates the idea of people here ? 
I remembered . Last time last year , when I brought mosquitos . And somehow , the people liked that , 
the idea became for them really tangible . You know , it &apos;s people there who are with mosquitos living 
for energy , falling . I did this , right ? 
I decided that this was releasing mosquitoes from fireflies , my contribution this year to the environment , would be here . 
Here are , then , some natural fireflies . 
You have me assured me that they &apos;re not biting . Actually , they &apos;re going to be . They &apos;re probably not even going to leave the glass . 
Now , there are all kinds of game solutions like this . But they bring all of them not much . 
We need solutions . Either one or more of them , which are an unimaginable scale and unimaginable reliability . And though it has many directions , in which people are looking for it . I really see only five of them looking for these big challenges . 
I have tides , geothermal fusion and biofuels omitted . 
These are perhaps doing a moderate contribution and if they do better , than I expect , it would be great . But my key message here is that we &apos;re working on all those five . And we can &apos;t do any of them because they give up because they intimidate us . Because everybody has significant problems . 
Look at them first . That &apos;s burning fossil fuels . Look at burning either coal or coal or natural gas , which is 
what you have to do there . Does it just seem like ? But that &apos;s it . You have to do all that CO2 . That &apos;s what you have to do after burning out of the chimney , and it &apos;s getting under pressure . Liquid and then somewhere else . And hope that it &apos;s there . 
It &apos;s got some pilot projects that are going to do that at a 60 @-@ 80 level . But it &apos;s going to get it to 100 , and it &apos;s going to be very difficult . And it &apos;s going to be an agreement on storing CO2 , and it &apos;s a big challenge . But that &apos;s the biggest problem here , the question of storing time . 
Who &apos;s going to make sure ? 
Who can make sure ? Who can guarantee something ? What literally is many billion times bigger . As any kind of waste that you &apos;re dealing with from nuclear and other things , 
imagine , That &apos;s a lot of volume . That &apos;s 
so , a hard nut . So 
next , nuclear energy 
, which has three major problems . The cost before all , especially in highly regulated countries , is high . The question of safety is that you really feel that nothing is wrong . Despite the human collaboration , that the fuel is not for weapons , that it &apos;s not used . 
And what does you do ? Then , with the waste . 
Because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concern . The 
people have to get good at that . 
184 : 00 10 20 000 GT 00 10 25 000 000 . So three , very difficult problems . The ones that may be solvable , three , very difficult problems . The ones that may be solvable and where you can work on that . 
The last three of the five have been summarized . It &apos;s 
the renewables . It &apos;s the renewables , as they &apos;re often called . 
And it &apos;s the renewables that have , although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel . They have some disadvantages . So 
one is that energy density is the energy density that these technologies generate dramatically lower . When the energy density 
of power plants is low , it &apos;s low @-@ energy . You talk about many square kilometers , thousands of times more space than a normal power plant , and you &apos;re 
also subject to . These sources are interruptions , 
the sun doesn &apos;t shine all day long . They shine all day long , not every day . And just as much as the wind doesn &apos;t blow all the time . 
So that &apos;s why , if you &apos;re from these sources , you have to have a way to use energy even in times . If you don &apos;t have it 
available , you have here . So there are big price challenges . It &apos;s challenges in terms of transmission . If we do say , for example , that the energy source is outside the country , you don &apos;t just need technology . You need to have technology at risk as well , that the energy is from where it 
comes from , and there is . That storage problem . 
And to address the dimension , the storage problem . I &apos;ve looked at all kinds of batteries that are made . The ones for cars , computers , mobile phones , flashlights for everything , and I &apos;ve compared that to the amount of electronic energy that the world uses . I found out that all batteries were the batteries that we &apos;re now producing , less than 10 minutes of total energy storage . 
Could we need to do this ? Well , we need a big breakthrough . Something that , to do a factor 100 , will be better . When the approaches to the moment are 
— this is not impossible . But it &apos;s not that easy . 
This is what happens when you try to find these interrupted sources , say , 20 , 30 percent of consumption . 
When you get around 100 percent of that , you need to have an incredible miracle battery . 
Now where are we going to go ? What is the right approach ? 
A Manhattan project . How do we get to the finish ? 
What we need is a lot of companies . The companies that work on it , hundreds 
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people . 
In many , they will say , &quot; They &apos;re crazy . &quot; That &apos;s good . 
I think here in the TED , I think there are a lot of people who are already engaged in this . 
Bill Gross has several companies under the leadership of , say , Esolar , who has great solar thermal technologies . 
Vinod Khosla is investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things . And interesting opportunities have , and I &apos;m trying to support that . 
Nathan Myhrvold and I are funding a company that might surprisingly , surprisingly , be taking a nuclear approach . 
It &apos;s got some innovations in the nuclear field : Modular , liquid , 
development in this industry . Before a while ago , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts have been around . 
That Terrapower concept means you have to replace a part of the uranium that &apos;s one percent , the U235 . We decided to take the 99 to burn . That &apos;s the U238 . That 
&apos;s a pretty crazy idea . 
But actually , you had about it for a long time . But you could never make reasonable simulations . Whether it works would . But since it became modern supercomputers , it &apos;s been possible to simulate it . And you can see that , yes , with the right approach to matter . It &apos;s like that it works . 
It works , and because you burn these 99 % . That cost profile is much better . In fact , 
you burn the garbage , and you can even burn the garbage from today &apos;s reactors . 
When you &apos;re using it as a drive , rather than breaking your head , you just burn it . A great thing . 
That uranium is gradually consumed . A little bit like a candle . 
You can see that it &apos;s kind of a column . Often , as a wandering wave , it 
&apos;s called a reactor , which really solves it . That fuel problem . 
Here &apos;s a picture of a place . In Kentucky , 
this is the waste . The 99 . You have the part of the one that &apos;s burned today . You have taken it out . So it says , &quot; Abused . &quot; Uranium : That shoots . 
The U.U. : For hundreds of hundreds of years . 
And if you want to buy ocean water cheaply and simply filtrate , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet &apos;s 
life . You know , there &apos;s still some more challenges . But there &apos;s a case of example of many hundreds of concepts . The ones we need to move forward is to get ahead . 
Think about it . How do we make our success measured ? 
How should our testimony look ? 
Well , let &apos;s go to the finish line . That we achieve must , and then talk . We talk about the intermediate step 
, many talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 . 
It &apos;s really , really important that we get there . 
The rest of the 20 percent are going to be produced in poor countries , and still some agriculture . Hopefully , forest threats and cement will happen . Until then , clean . 
So , to that 80 percent , you have to get the developed countries , including countries like China . Your generation of electricity will have to completely change . 
The other note says whether we &apos;re going to change zero emissions technology , whether they &apos;re going to be used in all developed countries . And we &apos;re going along the way , they &apos;re going to 
go to the rest . That &apos;s great , important . 
That &apos;s going to be a key element of this stuff . If we 
&apos;re going back from there , how should that be 2020 testimony ? 
It should be back to the two elements . 
We should be back to using the effectiveness measures to get reduction down the road . The less we emit , the less we emit the CO2 will be . And so , too , will the temperature . 
But actually , this note is for the things that we do . The things that we don &apos;t do completely , which lead to the big reductions . Only the same , or even a little less important . How the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs , 
These breakthroughs need to be fully gas @-@ tracked . And that can be measured . In company numbers , in pilot projects and regulatory changes , 
there are many great books on this subject . 
That Al Gore book . We have the choice . And David McKay &apos;s Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air . They 
go it really through . And they create a framework in which this is widely discussed . Because we need to have support for this from all sides . 
It &apos;s got some things that have to come together . 
That &apos;s a wish . 
It &apos;s a very concrete wish that we can invent this technology . 
If you tell me just one wish for the next 50 or so years . I could give the president a choice : A vaccine , and that &apos;s what I love . I , right ? I could choose that wish . I could choose that one . That is : Halved energy price . Without CO2 , it &apos;s invented . That wish would be my 
choice . This one has the greatest impact . If we take that wish , 
if we don &apos;t get that wish , the gap between long @-@ term and short @-@ term thinking will be . People , terrible , will be between the United States and China , between poor and rich countries . And almost all live in these two billion , and a lot worse will 
be . What do we have to do ? So 
what measures do I appeal for ? 
We have to work for more research funding . 
If countries are to be in places like coppenhages , they should not only be meeting on CO2 . 
They should be talking about this innovation strategy . And they would be shocked by the ridiculous low money that they spend on these innovative approaches . 
We need market incentives . We need carbon taxes . CAP &amp; amp ; Trade , something that sends out a price signal . 
We need to get the message across . 
We need dialogue , more rational and complete . And we also need to have the things that the government is doing . 
It &apos;s a very important wish . But I think we can do it . 
Thank you very much . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . Thank you . 
Thank you . Thank you very much . Just to get Terrapower a little better . First of all , you can give us an idea of the scale of this investment . 
Bill Gates : To simulate the simulation on a supercomputer , everybody , big scientists , get it . What we did was what we needed only a few 10 million . And even if we were to use our materials in a Russian reactor , to make sure that it was working properly . Is it just in the &apos; 100s that you were taking 
the difficult step ? Is building the first reactor ? More billions to find , the regulations and the place of the actual place that was the first to build . 
Once the first one is finished , when it &apos;s running the way it promised , everything is clear . Because the economy , the energy density , is so different from nuclear energy as we are . 
It &apos;s about about about that , right ? That means deep . In the ground , building almost into the ground like a vertical . Pillar : Nuclear fuel . This consumed uranium . And then the process starts at the top . And it works on going down . 
BG : Exactly . Today , you have to always have the refill reactor refilled . So there &apos;s a lot of people and a lot of controls going wrong . Can this thing , where you can open it ? And things in or out ? That &apos;s not good . 
If you do , though , very cheap fuel , you can use it for 60 years . Think about it . A column that you bury . Without it all the complexities . 
And it sits there . And it burns for 60 years . And then it &apos;s done . 
CA : A nuclear reactor . The self , a solution for the garbage , provides . 
BG : Yeah . Now , what about the garbage that happens ? You can do it . Let it be a lot less garbage with this method . Then take it . And grab it and put it in the next reactor . And burn it further . 
And we start by starting by putting the garbage . The one that already exists , which is in these refrigerators or dry tanks , at the reactors . That &apos;s our starting fuel . So that &apos;s 
what kind of stuff these reactors have had a problem with . That &apos;s what we have in our fill , and that &apos;s what dramatically reduces the garbage volume . While this process is 
going on , about , but as they &apos;re going to talk to different people in the world about these possibilities . 
Where is that biggest ? Interest , like that . What &apos;s really going to happen ? 
BG : Well , we &apos;ve got no time yet to get stuck to one place . And it &apos;s got a lot of interesting disclosure rules for everything . That nuclear in the name is wearing it . There &apos;s a lot of interest . And the people of the company were in Russia , India . China , I was here . And I have the Energy Minister . And that &apos;s how this led to the energy agenda . 
I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the French . And Japanese have something in their minds in the direction . 
This is a variant . One thing that was done , 
that &apos;s a very important step forward . But it &apos;s like a quick @-@ reaction engine . And some countries have these built these . That &apos;s why anyone who &apos;s building a quick @-@ reaction reactor is a candidate for our first one . 
CA : In your imagination , timeframe and probability . So this is really what you want to create . 
BG : Well , we need one of these scalable , power @-@ generating things that is very cheap . We have 20 years to invent . And then 20 years to invent , and then to use . 
That &apos;s kind of the deadline . The deadline that environmental models have shown us , which we have to comply with . 
And you know , Terrapower ? If everything is going well and that &apos;s a big wish , could it ? That &apos;s 
easy to hold and fortunately there are dozens of things that are happening today , and we need hundreds that are just the same . If their approaches work , the promotion of their pilots works , right ? For that , they can offer , 
and it would be best if several could do it . Because then , you could mix a mixture . You could definitely need a mix . So anyway , 
we need a solution . 
CA : So , with regard to the big , possible breakthroughs , this is the biggest one . That &apos;s what you know . 
BG : An energy break . Is that the most important thing ? 
That would be it without the most environmental challenge . But the power is still there . More importantly . 
In nuclear , there are other things that are innovative companies . 
You know , we know what their work is not as good as these . But it &apos;s the modular method that exists . That &apos;s a different approach . 
It &apos;s a liquid reactor type , which is a little bit difficult . But maybe you &apos;re saying that about us . 
And so there &apos;s different ones . But that &apos;s nice about it is that a uranium molecule , a million times as much energy as a say , has . We , a carbon molecule , and that &apos;s why , if you can deal with the problems , and they &apos;re mainly the radiation of the footprint . And the cost is that potential is playing out . So , the impact on the land and other things , almost in one &apos;s own league . 
CA : If that doesn &apos;t work , what 
do we have to do is take emergency action to try and stabilize the temperature of the Earth ? 
BG : If you &apos;re in this situation , it &apos;s like it &apos;s like you &apos;re eating too much . And for a moment before a heart attack , what do you do ? Then you need , maybe , a heart surgery or something like that . 
It &apos;s got a research that &apos;s going on called geoengineering . It &apos;s going to be looking at different techniques to get warming delayed . So that we can 20 or 30 years longer to get ourselves together . 
That &apos;s just one insurance method . 
You hope that we can &apos;t do that . 
Some people say you should even say you shouldn &apos;t get to insurance first because you can get that lazy , maybe , so you eat on , because you know you &apos;re going to save you from heart surgery . 
I know not whether that &apos;s smart . If you look at the importance of this problem , you think about it , but there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you can do that , whether you should have it . If the things get faster or faster , or this innovation takes longer than we expect . 
CA : Climate skeptics , do you have one or two sentences for those around ? You might want to convince ? 
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps . 
Those who are scientific arguments are those who do very little , 
say . They say it &apos;s negative effects . There are negative effects with the clouds . They &apos;re shifting things . 
It &apos;s very , very few things that they even say . There are very few of them that have a chance in a million . That &apos;s 
the main problem here , and it &apos;s similar to AIDS . 
You make the mistake . Now , and you pay very much for it much later . 
And that &apos;s why the idea is , now , if you can solve all sorts of urgent problems . In something to invest , from what you &apos;re only going to have later on . And to do that , the investment is not so clear that it &apos;s not so clear . In fact , the IPCC Report is not necessarily . That &apos;s the worst scenario . And it &apos;s people in the world of rich people who are getting to look at IPCC . And they say , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s not a big drama . The 
fact is that these uncertainty is giving us cause for concern . 
But my dream here is that this is that if you look at it economically and at the same time eliminate CO2 . &quot; Then they also say , &quot; Skeptics . &quot; Okay . It &apos;s interesting to me not that it doesn &apos;t emit CO2 . I wish it almost did , that it did . But I &apos;m going to accept it , because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method , I think . CA 
: And that would be your answer to Björn Lomborg . ( Laughter ) The argument that if you were to spend all this time and energy on the CO2 problem , you would have to solve it . All of the other goals , including those of poverty reduction , the fight against malaria , and so on , that it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources . Money . For that to be invested . While it &apos;s better things that are happening that we can do . 
BG : Well , actual spending on the research is , let &apos;s say , the U.S. should be 10 billion a year . More spending than they are doing today . That &apos;s not the dramatic thing . 
It should be other things that should not suffer . 
You come along to big amounts of money . And here you can have reasonable people contradictory . If you do have something that &apos;s not economically sound and you try to finance it . For me , this is where most waste happens . It &apos;s 
unless you &apos;re very , very short . Before you break through costs and only fund the learning curve . I think we should do more things , try and do the potential . Very much cheaper to be . 
If the swab hits you get , a very high energy price , is . Then you can only get the rich to keep up . 
I mean , each of us here could have five times as much for our energy , spend . Without his lifestyle , changing for 
the sake of the bottom two billion . 
But is it a disaster ? And even Lomborg thinks about 
his own new mesh , is now why is the research going to stop being discussed ? He 
&apos;s always going to be discussed because of his earlier stories with the skeptic camp . But he has understood that this is one very lonely group of people . And that &apos;s why he &apos;s now bringing the research argument , 
and that &apos;s a thought I think is appropriate . 
The research , it &apos;s just crazy . How little the research is supported 
? CA : Bill . I think I &apos;m speaking for almost everybody , I think . Here , if I say , &quot; I really hope that your desire will come true . &quot; Thank you very much . 
BG : Thank you . 
I would like to give you a little bit of a talk . What I &apos;m thinking about a few months ago when I wrote an article for Italian Wired . Is it me who wrote ? 
I always have my synonymous dictionary ready for use . But I was with the editing of the text . Already finished . And I fell on the fact that I &apos;ve never been in my life looking at it . What that word hinders really means , really . 
I read you the entry before 
you , disabled . Object : Curved . Helpless , useless , destroyed . Deceased , mutilated . Wounded , prepared , paralyzed . Separated . Keep it away . Determined , weakened @ impotent @ castriert @ paralyzed @ walking andicapt. @ senil @ age @-@ weak withdrawn from circulation @ improved , done @ broken @ borrowed @ counted ( see also injured ) @ useless And @ weak @ 
antonyme , healthy @ strong , powerful I have 
these list on my hands , read it out loud to a friend . And I had to laugh first . It worked like this ridiculous . But I came only until I was prepared and couldn &apos;t do any more . And I had to stop reading . And I had to collect first , after this invincible flood of words . 
And that with that emotional shock , Of course , that was a frayed old synonymous dictionary . I have become just wondering that I was issuing the issue pretty old 
. But actually , it was an issue on the early &apos; 80s . When I was just talking to primary school , and I started doing that , my self @-@ image outside of my family environment started to build . And to shape it , also in terms of other kids and other kids and the rest of the world around me . 
And God be thankful , I have at that time not used a synonymous dictionary . 
I would use this entry seriously . Take that , I would be in a world born of someone like me as a person who would perceive life as a person whose life in no way goes positive . Can today , however , I be voting in favour of opportunities and adventures that I have experienced ? 
Famous , so I &apos;ve immediately celebrated the online edition of 2009 , which I started to call myself . And I expect that I &apos;m going to make a more appealing contribution here . 
Here &apos;s the updated version . This entry , 
unfortunately , is not much better . In particular , 
I &apos;m shocked by the last two words under Near Antonym . Very much healthy . But 
it &apos;s not just about the issue of words . 
It &apos;s about what we &apos;re talking about about people . It &apos;s about what we &apos;re describing with these words . 
It &apos;s about the values that are in those words . And how we &apos;re describing these values . 
Our language is influencing our thinking and how we &apos;re shaping the world and people around us , and how we &apos;re seeing the world 
and the world around us . Many ancient societies , including those of the Greeks and the Romans , really believed that the Greeks and Romans &apos; pronunciation of a curse has a great force , because what you say loudly is manifesting itself can manifest itself . 
So what do we want ? Actually , you manifest a disabled person or a powerful person alone . Already , 
a person careless as a child to call it could be enough . You could restrict it and you could impose ideas on you , 
wouldn &apos;t it be more beautiful to open doors to you ? A person ? The 
one for me , who opened doors , was my pediatrician . AM : A.I.I. DuPont Institute in the Wilmington Institute in Delaware . 
He &apos;s called Dr. Pizzutillo , an Italo @-@ American whose name , as you can imagine . The majority of Americans , not correctly speaking , so he became always Dr. P. 
called Dr. P. And Dr. P. wore always very much colorful flies . And he was for work with the kids . 
Simple , how made . I found the time that I found in this hospital that I spent . Simply great , except for my physiotherapy . 
I had to do some exercises , seemingly infinitely . With these thick , elastic bands in different colors . That &apos;s what you know about . My leg muscles build up , and I have these bands hated more . When everything else , I have them hated . I have them cursed . I have them hated . 
And imagine if you can , I have even already been as a kid of five with Dr. P. negotiated . And so , this is how these exercises try to stop . Natural , without success . 
And one day , he has me at a one of my exercises . These exercises were simple , tiring . And mercilessly and he said to him , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you &apos;re such a strong guy . Strong and young girl , you &apos;re going to be one of those tapes one day . 
And if you break it , give it to you a hundred dollars . &quot; 
That was , of course , just a simple trick by Dr. P. to get the exercises done . The ones I don &apos;t want to do with the prospect that the richest five @-@ year @-@ old girl in the hospital will be on the second floor . But he has me actually to do that . My daily exercise horror with new eyes , to see . So this has turned into a new and promising experience . 
And I ask myself today , how much his vision of the world as strong and powerful is that young girl . My self @-@ image has shaped and I have imagined myself like this , as one of nature , strong , powerful and atlethic people , to see myself . 
That &apos;s just one example of what many people like adults are . In power positions , the imagination of a child can 
inspire , but like the examples that I &apos;ve already mentioned from the synonymous dictionaries , our language doesn &apos;t allow us any space to imagine something . What we &apos;re all hoping for would be for each and every one of us to be able to make ourselves a powerful human being . 
Our language is lagging behind social change . The ones that in many cases are caused by technological change , caused by medical considerations , have the potential to do so . 
You can , of course , say that my legs , laser surgery for visually impaired visually impaired , knee joints made of titanium and artificial hip joints . For aging bodies , which make it possible for people to really all their possibilities . And to get to the limits that they have to know their natural destiny beyond the limits that they have . Even not to talk . Not to talk about social networking platforms . People are allowing themselves to have their own identity , giving themselves their own way of defining themselves . 
And they are defining themselves globally . They are oriented towards groups that they choose . 
Maybe that &apos;s why this technological change is clearer . Because ever before , it &apos;s always been a different truth . And that is , that every human being in society has something very special and very powerful to give . And that the human ability to engage in adaptation . Our greatest plus is 
the human being &apos;s ability to adapt . That &apos;s a really interesting story . Because people tell me time and again about asking me to tell me how to deal with adversity , and I &apos;m going to confess something to you . This sentence has a very important sentence for me . And I &apos;ve never been very happy with it . I &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable with answering people &apos;s questions , and I think I &apos;m beginning to understand . I understand why . 
This sentence from dealing with adversity is alive from dealing with the idea that success or happiness is dependent on it . A challenge to master without being challenged by it , without the experience that it entails . When it comes to my life as if it had been so successful , because I could see the possible traps of a life with a prosthesis . Or how , anyway , people people will tell me about my disability . 
But the truth is that we have to change . Of course , we are facing the challenge . No matter whether you &apos;re physical , emotional or even both , 
and I &apos;m saying that &apos;s good . 
Distastements are not an obstacle . That we curve , to get around with our lives better , clearer , clearer . 
Distasteful is just part of our lives . 
And I tend to be hostility as my shadow . 
Sometimes , I realize that he &apos;s very present . Sometimes he &apos;s hardly too visible . But he &apos;s constantly at me . 
And I want to make absolutely no sense of the impact or severity of the fight of a human being . It &apos;s in life 
adversity and adversity and challenges . And the challenges are all too real . And each person goes with it differently . So , to ask the question , isn &apos;t it whether we can get clear or not with adversity ? It &apos;s how we get clear with it . 
So we &apos;re not just responsible for that . The people who we love before we hit fate , but we save them from preparing them for it . All right . 
So , to get clear . And we do our children no better than we do . If we give them the feeling that we feel they &apos;re not adapting , You have 
to do two things clearly . So one is the medical fact : Amputee the medical fact and the other . The social opinion about whether I &apos;m disabled is whether I &apos;m disabled or not . 
And to be honest , the social opinion about whether or not I &apos;m disabled is the only real and lasting disability that I had to deal with , and that is that the world is constantly saying . It can tell me with these definitions , 
right ? In our desire to make people understand how to protect the people that care about us . And to give them the cold , hard truth about their medical prediction . Or even a prediction about quality of life . Imagine the ones that expect them , we need to be careful not to lay the foundation for someone actually being disabled . 
Maybe it &apos;s the current concept . That &apos;s just looking at what &apos;s going to break . And how we do that , for everyone , fixing it , making it a greater disability than pathology itself . 
If we do a human being not treat it holistically and not treat all of his forces . And possibilities , And acknowledging , we create , in addition to the natural struggle that you might need to fight . 
A further disease . We degrade one human being who is responsible for our society , a human being . 
So we need to talk about patology beyond patology . Look and look at everybody . We need to look at all areas of human possibilities . 
At the very most important point . But is it that it &apos;s between perception of our shortcomings and our great inventive spirit to 
connect between ? We should connect these challenging times , not devalue or deny them . We should not try to try to avoid them . We should not try to avoid them , nor should we sweep them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about recognizing opportunities in adversity . 
It &apos;s about maybe I &apos;m more about making it clear that we &apos;re not necessarily not necessarily going to have to overcome adversity , but that we &apos;re open to it . You &apos;re hugging it . You &apos;re in the pot to grab it , and you can also use a fight expression . And maybe even with that dancing . 
And maybe you can do it against adversity as something natural , coherent . And useful to see . And feel us like this through your presence , no more . So burdened in 
this year , celebrating this year &apos;s 200th birthday , Charles . Darwin and as he was 150 years ago celebrating evolution , written about evolution , Darwin , in my eyes , has something very true in human character , in fact . I would like 
to rewrite it that way , not the strongest of its kind survives . And also , not the smartest of its kind , but that of change in its best way to adapt . 
From conflicts , creativity does not just emerge 
from Darwin &apos;s work . Knowledge , we know that the ability of man to survive and flourish from struggle of struggle of the human mind . Determined is the result of conflict , to change . 
So again , change . And adaptation is the greatest ability to adapt is the human being . 
And maybe you know , we only know from what wood . We carved . When we &apos;re really tested , we know . Maybe it &apos;s that . 
The point of adversity . It &apos;s that perception of ego . It &apos;s that sense of our own power . 
We can feel that self @-@ same . 
We can give ourselves something to adversity , a new meaning , that goes beyond difficult times . 
Maybe it &apos;s that we can change adversity . 
Adversity is the way change is changing . The ones we &apos;re not yet adapting to . 
I think that &apos;s the greatest damage we &apos;re doing to ourselves . It &apos;s believing that we 
should be normal . Let &apos;s face it . Who is normal ? 
It &apos;s not normal . 
It &apos;s there . It &apos;s the usual . The typical , but not . That normal . And would you like to have those poor , gray person really know ? Learning to learn if it really wants them ? 
I think more of a bit of a thing . 
It would be great . If we could have this pattern of thinking of normality against another of the possibilities or the strength around it , even another little more dangerous , to put it in a way . Exchange could be done . So that &apos;s how we can exchange the forces of very many children . And they can invite them to release their very special and valuable abilities into society , to 
bring them into society . Anthropolgen has found out that we have human beings from members of our society , always one thing we have demanded : Being useful . And one contribution to make . 
It &apos;s evidence of how already , the Neanderthals , 60 years ago , older people , 60,000 people , and people with severe physical injuries , had worn . And that &apos;s perhaps because the neanderthal experience in survival struggle of these people for society is valuable to society . 
They have these people not as people broken . And useless . They &apos;ve been seen as something special . And valuable treated before 
a few years ago , I went to the city , the city where I grew up . In a food market , in that Red Zone , in the northeast of Pennsylvania , and I stood there in front of a cup of tomatoes . 
It was summer . And I had shorts on and 
I had shorts , and I hear a guy behind me say , &quot; &quot; Well , if that &apos;s not Aimee Mullins , 
and I turn around and see me see this older man . &quot; I had no idea . Who he is ? 
And I meant , &quot; Excuse me . &quot; Sir , do we know ? I can &apos;t get involved in you . I can &apos;t remember you . &quot; And 
he said , &quot; Well , you &apos;re unlikely to be . &quot; 
I remember when I reminded you of you for the first time , I looked at you from your mother &apos;s belly . &quot; 
Oh , so , he did . 
&quot; And of course it did . But click made . 
That was Dr. Kean , a man I only made of narratives of my mother about this day . Because I was , of course , quite typical of my birthday , two weeks late , the doctor for prenatal diagnostics . 
My mother was in vacation , and so I knew my parents knew the man who made me born , At all , not . 
And because I was without a calf &apos;s legs . And my feet were looking after them , and my feet were just one few toes , and I had one and a few toes . AM THE OTHER foot was it was the carrier of this stranger , and he had to bring the bad news . 
He said to me , &quot; I had to tell your parents that you never would walk . And never would you be so mobile as others would be kids , or you would never be an independent life . &quot; Could and ever since , they &apos;ve just lied to me . Punished , really 
? Exceptional , I found that he had newspaper clips of my entire childhood collected . No matter if I was competing for a letter in second grade , whether I had won . Whether I was competing with the scout scouts at the Halloween Parade on Halloween , whether I was traveling my scholarship or a scholarship or one of my sporting victories . And he used these clips to make his students go to teach . Medical students from the Hahnemann Medical School and the Hershey Medical School , 
and he called it this part of his course , the X factor . That potential of human will , 
you can just not do enough to emphasize how crucial this factor is to quality of life for a human being . 
And Dr. Kean told us , &quot; He said , &quot; I learned that when children are not constantly doing something else , they get something else . And so even if they &apos;re just a little bit supported , if you kids themselves , you leave them to themselves , children can do a lot . Look 
at it . DR : Kean has his . 
Think has changed . He had understood that the medical diagnosis and how someone could deal with it . 
Two different things are : And also , I have my thinking in the course of time changed . If you want to change me at the age of 15 , would you have asked me if I could have my prostheses against legs made of meat and bones ? Would that have made me not have hesitated for a second ? 
I wanted to do it normally at that time . 
If you would have me ask that today , I &apos;m not so sure . 
And that &apos;s what happened . Because I have something to do with my legs . And not despite these experiences . And maybe I could have 
done that change because I was so many people I &apos;ve met . The ones that open doors instead of people opening doors to me , instead of meeting people who restrict me or wanted to muzzle me with an idea . 
See , it takes really just a little person . The one who &apos;s demonstrating to you how they can manifest their forces . And they &apos;re through when 
they &apos;re doing it to somebody . His own inner forces to activate them . The human mind is like this receptive . When you do that and for you to be in a critical moment , a door to open to someone . Then there you are for these people . There &apos;s a very good teacher . 
You bring them to your own self @-@ teaching 
to open doors . The real meaning of the word educate is rooted in the word educe . It 
means something to produce that in a person who has the potential to tickle 
out , again , what potential do you want ? We do , we call out in 
the &apos; 60s , and in Britain , a case study was done . Back then , high schools were transformed into schools . 
They call this &quot; streaming trials . &quot; In the United States , we call this tracking , 
and students are becoming . After grades , they are divided 
and the A students become more severely audited orally . The better teachers , etc . 
, they then have a three @-@ month period of time , students with a sufficiently high grade , very well given . It was given to them . They were told that they were Aces that they were very smart . And after these three months , they have really a single letter . 
And of course , it breaks you the heart to hear that the other way around , the one @-@ serer students were told . They were just enough and just as 
much , it was . Then , after the three months , too . But only 
those who always have to go to school , still , apart from the students who were at school , who had to miss the school . 
All the more important in this study was that the teachers were not inaugurated . 
The teachers knew not that something was changed . 
They were just told that they were the Einser students and that they were the students with the grade enough and the same thing they gave them something they taught . 
And they treated the only real thing that &apos;s disabled is a broken mind . A mind that &apos;s broken has broken has no hope anymore . It finds nothing more beautiful . It lacks our natural , childish . It lacks curiosity . And our innate ability to imagine imagination , 
if we do , but we can create the human mind to help with it . And then hoping to continue to hope for ourselves and other people around us to find beautiful . It &apos;s curious and imaginative to be curious , and then we really put our forces in a positive position . 
A : If a mind is talking about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new forms of existence . 
I want to talk to you about a poem . That of a Persian poet called Poet Hafiz , in the 14th century , was written . And by the one that my friend Jacques Dembois tells me about , and the poem is called &quot; The God Who Only Words Four . &quot; Every child knows God , not the God . The name , not the God of Forbitions , but the God . The God Who Words Only Four Words , and repeats these all the time . 
He says , &quot; Just come dance with me . &quot; &quot; Come dance with me . &quot; Thank you very much .
