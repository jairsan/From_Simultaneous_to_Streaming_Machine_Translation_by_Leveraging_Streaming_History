A few years ago here at TED , Peter Skillman presented a design competition called &quot; The Marshmallow Challenge . &quot;
The idea is pretty simple .
Four teams have to create the widest possible freestanding structure with 20 spaghetti , about 1m tape , about 1m thread .
And build a marshmallow , the marshmallow has to get up on top .
And though it really seems simple , it &apos;s actually true .
Hard , because it &apos;s pushing people to work together very quickly .
And so I thought this is an interesting idea .
And I turned it into a design workshop .
It was a huge success .
Since then , I &apos;ve been doing about 70 workshops around the world .
With students , developers and architects , even CTOs , the Fortune 50 companies , and there &apos;s something about this task .
What deep impressions into nature .
It allows cooperation , and I want to share some of them with you .
Normally , most people start themselves .
With regard to the task of orienting , they talk about it , they think about what it looks like .
Will it hang around to power ? Then they invest .
A little time .
In planning and organization , they sketch and put spaghetti out . They invest a lot of their time .
In assembling constantly growing structures , and finally , just before they have time .
Does anybody take the Marshmallow ?
And they gently put it .
You take a step to the top .
Back and admire TA @-@ da .
You admire your work .
But what happens then almost always is that TA @-@ da becomes an UH @-@ Oh .
Because the weight of the marshmallow causes the whole thing to bend and collapse , there are a number of people who have much more UH @-@ Oh moments .
As others , and among the worst , are freshest BWL graduates , they lie , they cheat .
They &apos;re confused .
And they really produce .
Droughty entities .
And of course , there are teams .
They have much more TA @-@ DA formations and are among the best .
Fresh graduates of the kindergarten , and that &apos;s quite amazing .
As Peter told us , they not only produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting ones .
Structures of all , what you might ask .
Is this how does it come ?
Why ?
What about those and Peter ?
Does none of the kids tell us ? Is it time to invest in the head of Spaghetti GmbH ?
They don &apos;t invest time .
There &apos;s another reason in power struggles , but there &apos;s another reason , and that is that BWL students have been trained .
They have to find the right plan .
OK .
And then they have to realize what happens .
If you put the marshmallow on top , they don &apos;t have time anymore , and what happens ?
It &apos;s a crisis .
Sounds familiar .
What else do kindergarten kids do ?
What they do is they start with the marshmallow .
And prototypes build successful prototypes .
Always with the marshmallow at the top .
So they have multiple possibilities to repair dilapidated prototypes .
Constructors recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of an iterative process .
And with every attempt , the kids get immediately .
Feedback : What works ?
And what doesn &apos;t .
So the performance with prototypes is like :
Working essential , but let &apos;s see how different .
Teams act . The average for most is about 50 centimeters of BWL students .
Half of them do .
Lawyers do something about that .
More , but not .
A lot of kindergarten kids .
Are better .
Than adults . Who &apos;s most successful ?
Architects and engineers .
Fortunately , 1m is the highest I &apos;ve seen .
And why ?
Because you understand triangles .
And self @-@ reinforcing geometric patterns .
Are the keys ?
To build stable structures , CEOs are slightly above average .
But here it gets interesting .
You put an executive administrator on the team , they get significantly better . It &apos;s incredible .
You look around and you see this team .
You can predict that .
Why ?
Is that possible ?
Because you have special skills in process monitoring .
You run the process . You understand it , and that team that controls and pays attention to the work will significantly improve the performance of the team .
Specialized skills and process skills and their combination will lead to success .
If you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six that have stable structures .
I tried something exciting . I thought , let &apos;s get the poker bet right away .
So I offered a $ 10,000 prize .
Software for the winners . What do you think happened ?
With these design students , what was that ?
Result : This didn &apos;t happen .
A team had a stable structure .
If anyone had built a two @-@ inch construction , he would have borne the prize home .
So isn &apos;t it interesting ?
That high betting has a strong effect ? We repeated this exercise with the same students .
What do you think happened ?
Well , you understood the advantage .
The prototyping , it turned out to be the same bad team .
One of the best ones , they made the highest construction in the least time .
So there are profound lessons for us .
About the nature of propulsion and success , you may ask .
Why ?
Would anyone actually invest time ?
Creating a Marshmallow Challenge .
The reason is , I help digital tools .
And make processes to help teams .
Cars , video games and visual .
Create effects .
And what the Marshmallow Challenge does is it helps you identify hidden assumptions .
Because frankly , every project has its own Marshmallow that challenges .
A shared experience , a common language or attitude to build the right prototype .
And this is the value of this experience .
This simple exercise , and those of you who are interested in it , can be MarshmallowChallenge @ com.
It &apos;s a blog where you can see .
How to build the Marshmallows .
There &apos;s a step @-@ by @-@ step guide there . You can find crazy examples .
Around the world , like people optimize and refiner the system , there are also world records , and I think the basal lesson is :
Is the construction ?
In fact , a connecting sport .
Is it required ?
Is it that we all focus our senses on the task and that we use our thinking optimally ?
How our feelings and our actions in the challenge that lies ahead of us ?
And sometimes a small prototype .
This experience , everything it takes .
From an UH @-@ Oh to a TA @-@ DA moment .
To bring that to a point , and that can make a big difference .
Thank you very much .
Let &apos;s pretend we have a machine here .
A big machine .
A cool TED @-@ like one .
Machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
And everybody in this room has to go in , and you can go into the past , you can go into the future .
You can &apos;t stay in the here and now .
And I wonder what you &apos;re choosing .
Because I &apos;ve been asking my friends this question a lot recently , and they all wanted to go into the past .
I don &apos;t know they wanted to go back to time before cars existed .
Or Twitter or America .
Suck the superstar .
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re kind of drawn to nostalgia , wishful thinking .
And I understand that . I &apos;m not part of this group .
Do I have to say , I don &apos;t want to go back to the past , and not because I &apos;m an adventurer ?
It &apos;s because opportunities on this planet don &apos;t go back .
They go forward , so I want to go into this machine , and I want to go into the future .
This is the greatest time .
The time that has ever been on this planet , no matter what scale they &apos;re going to take .
Health , wealth .
Mobility , opportunities , declining .
Disease rates . There has never been a time like this : My great grandparents died .
Everybody when they were 60 , my grandparents pushed this number to 70 , my parents .
Are the 80 ?
On the heels .
So there should be a nine at the beginning of my death .
But it &apos;s not even about people .
How do we ? Because this is a bigger thing .
As a child born today in New Delhi , it can be .
Expect to live for so long .
Like the richest man in the world , think 100 years ago .
You think about it . This is an incredible fact .
And why is this ?
Skirts , smallpox , have killed billions of people on the planet .
They have the demographics of the Earth .
They have redesigned in a way that no war has ever managed .
They &apos;re gone .
They &apos;ve disappeared .
We &apos;ve defeated them .
Puff in the rich world .
Do diseases exist ?
The millions of us who threatened just a generation ago ?
Hardly any diphtheria is rubbing polio .
Does it know at all ?
Anyone else ?
What is vaccines ?
Modern medicine .
Our ability to feed billions of people , these are successes .
The scientific method , and in my view , the scientific method is things .
Try it out , see if it works .
It changes if it doesn &apos;t .
One of the greatest achievements of humanity , that &apos;s the good news .
Unfortunately , that &apos;s the good news .
Because there are some other problems .
And they &apos;ve been mentioned many times .
And one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people in the world every day .
Hungry to bed .
Go up this number and it rises very quickly .
And that &apos;s embarrassing .
And not just that .
We &apos;ve used our imagination to do that .
We &apos;ve used this world to thoroughly devastate : Drinking water , primal land , rainforests .
Oil , gas , they disappear .
And soon .
And if we don &apos;t innovate out of this chaos , we also disappear the question .
So can we do that ?
I think it &apos;s clear , I think , that we produce food .
Can the billions of people feed ?
Will it be without the land they live on ?
To rape . I think we can power this world .
It doesn &apos;t destroy it at the same time . I really think so .
And no .
That &apos;s not wishful thinking .
But this keeps me awake at night .
One of the things that keeps me awake at night : We &apos;ve never needed scientific progress so much .
How do we do it now ?
Never before .
And we &apos;ve never been able to make it reasonable .
We used to use it as we can today .
We &apos;re on the threshold of amazing , amazing events in many areas , and yet I really think that hundreds of 300 years before the Enlightenment , we &apos;re going back .
Would it take us to find a time ?
In the way we &apos;ve been fighting progress , where we &apos;ve been more violent about these things .
On more fronts than now , people are wrapping themselves in their faith , so narrow .
You don &apos;t liberate them .
Can &apos;t even be the truth .
You liberate and hear them .
Everybody has a right .
In fact , to their opinion , a right .
To their opinion on progress , but you know what they don &apos;t have a right to .
They don &apos;t have a right to their own facts .
You don &apos;t have a charge , and I took a while .
To figure out that out about a decade ago , I published an article about vaccines for The New Yorker .
A little article , and I was amazed at resistance .
I encountered resistance to what ended up being the most effective action in healthcare in the history of humanity .
I didn &apos;t know what I was doing .
So if I was to do something , I was just doing what I was always doing .
I wrote an article and I went on .
And soon afterwards , I wrote an article about genetically modified .
Food : The same thing .
Just bigger . People were crazy .
So I also wrote an article about this , and I couldn &apos;t understand .
Why ?
People thought that was frankenfood .
Why ?
They thought molecules were moving around in a certain way , rather than a random way , an attack on nature .
Was it , you know , I &apos;m doing what I &apos;m doing ?
I wrote the article . I kept going .
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist .
We type , we &apos;re rich , we go eating . That &apos;s okay .
But these articles worried me .
And I couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually found .
I found out .
And that &apos;s because these fanatics who made me crazy .
No fanatics at all .
Were these prudent people ?
Educated people , decent people , they were just like the people in this room .
And that got me so confused .
But then I thought , &quot; You know what ?
Let &apos;s be honest .
We &apos;re at a point .
We &apos;re not at the same point as progress .
As we used to talk .
Intermediate . We talk ironically about it . &quot;
With small quotes , that &apos;s why progress is okay , there are reasons for it .
And I think we know what reasons that are .
We have trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science .
In itself , lost , and there &apos;s no reason why that shouldn &apos;t be like that .
You can just name a few names .
And people will understand Chernobyl .
Bhopal , Challenger , Vioxx Weapons of Mass Destruction , the 2000 US presidential election , I mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
There are questions and problems .
With the people we thought were always right .
So be skeptical .
Ask questions , demand .
You demand evidence .
You take evidence .
You take nothing but given .
Go ahead , but now , if you get evidence , you have to accept that evidence .
And that &apos;s not good at us .
And I can say that for the reason .
That we are now living in an epidemic of fear , as I &apos;ve never seen before .
And hopefully never again , about 12 years ago , it was .
A story was published .
A terrible story .
The Autism epidemic with measles , mumps and rubells associated vaccine .
Very scary .
Haufenwise , studies were done .
To see if that was true , Haufenwise studies should be done .
That &apos;s a serious matter .
The data came in .
The data came in .
From the United States , from England , from Sweden , from Canada , and they were all the same .
No correlation , no connection .
No , no , it .
It doesn &apos;t matter .
It doesn &apos;t matter .
Because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see .
What we believe in seeing , what makes us feel real .
We don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents .
We believe in a government agency that gives us data , and I understand that . I think we all do that .
But you know what ?
The result of that was catastrophic .
Catastrophic because of this fact . The United States is one of the only countries in the world .
In which the measles vaccine rate is falling , this is scandalous , and we should be ashamed .
It &apos;s terrible .
What happened ?
That we could do that .
Well , I understand that .
That &apos;s what I do .
Because does anybody have measles here ?
Does one in the audience have a measles ?
The person who sees people die of measles doesn &apos;t happen very often .
Is it happening in this country ?
It doesn &apos;t happen at all .
But 160,000 times in the world .
Last year , these are many deaths from measles .
20 per hour , but because this doesn &apos;t happen here .
We can push it out .
And people like Jenny McCarthy can .
Walk around .
And messages of fear .
And illiteracy of platforms like Oprah and Larry King preach live , and they can do that .
Because they don &apos;t connect cause and correlation .
They don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same .
But almost never are the same , and that &apos;s something we learn .
It &apos;s very quick . This guy was a hero of Jonas Salk . He liberated us from one of the worst scourges of humanity .
Don &apos;t worry .
Don &apos;t worry .
No pain . Chestness .
Puff
Gone
The guy in the middle , not so much .
He &apos;s called Paul Offit .
He &apos;s just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a few other people .
He can live 400 , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
Save pretty well .
Not . Well , that &apos;s good .
Apart from Paul walking around talking about vaccines and saying how valuable they are .
And people just stop .
Should they complain ?
And that &apos;s what he says , actually , so Paul is a terrorist , so when Paul speaks in a public hearing , he can &apos;t do without armed guards .
Tell him he gets calls .
Home .
Because people like to tell him .
They know where his kids go to school , and why ? Because Paul made a vaccine .
I don &apos;t need that .
Tell me , but vaccines are essential .
Take them away .
Turn the diseases back .

Terrible diseases .
And that &apos;s what happens .
We have measles in this country right now , and that &apos;s getting worse .
And pretty soon , kids will die of it again .
Because that &apos;s just a question .
The numbers , and they will not just die of measles .
What about polio ?
Let &apos;s take that .
Why ?
Not .
A fellow militant .
I wrote to me a few weeks ago saying , &quot; She believes I &apos;m a little too shrill .
Nobody has ever said that before .
She wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against polio . &quot;
Absolutely not .
Fine , why ?
Because we don &apos;t have polio .
And you know what ?
We didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
Today , I don &apos;t know . Maybe this morning somebody went up in Lagos .
He &apos;s flying in an airplane and he &apos;s flying .
Go ahead .
Angeles .
He &apos;s over Ohio at the moment .
And in a few hours he lands and rents .
A car , and he comes to Long .
Beach , and he &apos;s going to be one of these fantastic TED dinner .
This evening , and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a paralyzing disease .
And we also know that .
Not because that &apos;s how the world works .
Well , that &apos;s the planet .
We live on . Don &apos;t do it .
It &apos;s as if it &apos;s not . We love it .
We love to lie . We love it .
Do you all have your vitamins this morning ?
Take Echinacea .
A little antioxidant , that &apos;s what it does .
Just jump on the jumps .
Does I help ?
I know .
You did that .
Because half of Americans do that every day .
They take that stuff .
And they take alternative remedies .
And it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
How often we find that they &apos;re useless ?
The data records that all the time .
They evaporate their urine .
They do more .
Never before .
That &apos;s okay .
They like 28 billion dollars .
I agree with you completely about dark urine .
Dark urine : Dark . Why ?
Let &apos;s do that ? Why ?
Let &apos;s do that .
Well , I think we understand .
Hate the pharmaceutical industry .
We hate too strong a government .
We don &apos;t have confidence .
We should not have confidence in the system , and that &apos;s not our healthcare system .
Mies , it &apos;s cruel .
Too many millions of people , it &apos;s absolutely amazing .
It &apos;s cold and soulful , even .
To us who can afford it , so we &apos;re walking away from it and where are we going .
We &apos;re walking into the arms of the placebo industry . That &apos;s great .
I love the placebo industry .
But you know that ?
Is it really a serious matter ?
Because that stuff is crap .
And we &apos;re giving billions of dollars for it .
And I have all sorts of little props here , no .
Of them , Gingko was cheating .
Echinacea was cheating .
Acai : I don &apos;t know .
Let &apos;s see what that is .
But we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it .
It &apos;s cheating , and you know what ?
When I say that , people scream at me .
And they say , &quot; What &apos;s it that cares about ? &quot;
&quot; Let people do it . &quot;
What they want , they feel good .
And you know what ?
They &apos;re wrong .
Because I don &apos;t care .
Whether it &apos;s the Health Minister who says , &quot; Hmm , I &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts on mammography . &quot;
Or some cancer quack salver who wants to treat his patients with coffee intakes when they go down that path .
Where faith and magic replace evidence and science , they get to a place where they don &apos;t want to be .
They get to Thabo .
Mbeki in South Africa : He killed 400,000 of his people because he insisted that red beds , garlic and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs .
We know they &apos;re able to slow down the course of AIDS .
Hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country worse than any other one of these diseases .
Will you tell me , please don &apos;t you tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences ?
They have . They always have . Well , the most brain @-@ free epidemic .
We &apos;re in this absurd battle right now between the advocates of genetically modified organisms .
Modified food and the bio @-@ elite . That &apos;s an idiotic one .
Debate : It has to stop .
It &apos;s a debate about words about metaphors . That &apos;s ideology .
It &apos;s not science .
Everything we eat , every grain of rice , every branch of parsley , every sprouts .
It &apos;s changed by people .
You know , there were no mandarin .
In paradise , there were no cantaloupe melons .
There were no Christmas trees .
We did all of that .
We &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
And some of it worked .
And some of it didn &apos;t .
We got rid of it .
What didn &apos;t ?
It worked . Now we can make it more accurate .
And of course , there are risks .
But we can do something like vitamin A in rice .
And the stuff can help millions of people .
Millions of people , their lives .
They want to prolong that .
They don &apos;t want to do that .
I have to say , I understand that .
We don &apos;t reject genetically .
Modified food .
Why ?
Let &apos;s do that .
Well , what I hear all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides .
Hormones .
Mono @-@ culture . We don &apos;t want huge fields .
One thing : That &apos;s wrong .
We don &apos;t want companies to patent lives . We don &apos;t want companies to own seeds .
And you know what ?
My answer to all of this is , yes , you &apos;re right .
Let &apos;s fix that .
It &apos;s true .
We have a huge food problem .
But that &apos;s not science .
That &apos;s not science .
It &apos;s right .
Moral patent crab . You know that science is not a company .
It &apos;s not a country .
It &apos;s not even an idea .
It &apos;s a process .
It &apos;s a process .
And sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t .
But the idea that we should not allow science to do its work .
Because we &apos;re afraid .
Is it a real impasse ?
And it keeps millions of people from flourishing .
You know , over the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to grow 70 percent more food .
Do 70 percent of the investment in Africa in the last 30 years have to be made ?
Shameful , shameful . You need that , and we give it to you .
Not , and why ?
Genetically .
Modified food .
We don &apos;t want to encourage people to do this rotten stuff .
Eating , like Maniok Maniok , is something that half a billion people eat .
It &apos;s like a potato .
It &apos;s just a bunch of calories .
It &apos;s bad .
It doesn &apos;t have nutrients .
It doesn &apos;t have protein .
And scientists are building all this right now .
In it , and then people could eat it .
And wouldn &apos;t it be blind ?
They wouldn &apos;t starve .
And you know what ?
That would be nice .
It wouldn &apos;t be Chez .
Panisse , but it would be nice , and all I can say is , why do we fight this ?
I mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why ?
Let &apos;s fight this .
Because we don &apos;t want to push genes around .
It &apos;s not about pushing genes around . It &apos;s not about chemicals .
It &apos;s not about our ridiculous ones .
It &apos;s about passion for hormones .
It &apos;s about insisting on more food .
It &apos;s about better food .
It &apos;s about unique food .
It &apos;s not about rice .
Crispies : It &apos;s about keeping people alive .
And it &apos;s high time to understand .
What that means , because you know what if we don &apos;t do that ?
If we go on as we do before , we start doing it .
Something guilty of it .
I don &apos;t think we do .
We want to be guilty of high @-@ tech colonialism . There &apos;s no other description .
For what &apos;s happening here , it &apos;s selfish .
It &apos;s ugly .
It &apos;s not worthy of us .
And we really have to stop that .
So after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; Do you still want to be in this ridiculous ? &quot;
Time machine and the future definitely go .
I definitely want that .
Right now , it &apos;s in the present .
But we have an incredible opportunity . We can put this time machine on everything .
What we want , we can move it .
Where we move it .
We want it , and we will get it there .
Move where we want it .
We need to have these conversations .
And we need to think .
But when we go into the time machine and go into the future .
We &apos;ll be glad we did that .
I know we can .
And as far as I &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs now .
Thank you .
Thank you .
When Steve Lopez , columnist of Los Angeles Times , one day , went through the streets in central Los Angeles .
Did he hear wonderful music ?
She came from a man , an African @-@ American , sympathetic .
Rough homeless , who played on a violin .
The only two strings left , many of them will know the story .
Because from Steve &apos;s article about it , later on , a book was filmed .
With Robert Downey Junior , when Steve Lopez and Jamie Foxx , as Nathaniel Anthony .
Ayers , the contrabass player who studied at the Juilliard Conservatory , and whose promising career tragically early on through his paranoid career .
Schizophrenia ended . Nathaniel left Juilliard , suffered a nervous breakdown , and 30 years later he lived on the streets of Skid Row as homeless .
In the center of Los Angeles , I recommend to you all Steves &apos; book .
Read or watch the movie .
So you can not only understand the wonderful connection .
The one that &apos;s been created between these two men , but also how the music creates that connection .
Helped and how it was eventually the instrument , when this play of words is allowed , that helped .
Nathaniel , getting away from the street , I met Mr. Ayers in 2008 .
Two years ago at Walt Disney Concert Hall , he just had a demonstration .
Heard about Beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine myself .
He spoke in a very cheerful and sociable tone .
About Yo @-@ Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and about how the Dodgers never made it into baseball world .
Series : And all of this because of the insidious passage .
The first violin in the last sentence of Beethoven &apos;s Fourth Symphony : &quot; We got to the topic . &quot;
&quot; Speaking music , &quot; and a few days later , I got an email saying , &quot; That &apos;s what I &apos;m saying . &quot;
That Nathaniel was interested in violin lessons with me , and I have to mention that Nathaniel refused medical treatment , because he was already with electric shocks and thorazine .
And handcuffs were treated .
A trauma that haunted him all his life as a result of that is now particularly vulnerable .
For these schizophrenic phases , which are sometimes so bad that they threaten to tear him apart .
And he disappears for days .
In the streets of Skid Row , this horror is always wandering around .
And exposed to the torturing torments of his own mind , and in exactly the same stage of attraction , Nathaniel was when we were in Walt Disney Concert Hall with our first lesson .
He started this crazy flicker in his eyes .
And he was totally lost .
He talked about invisible .
Demons and smoke and about how someone poisoned him in sleep .
Want I to be afraid ?
Not for me , but for me , I was afraid .
I was afraid I was losing him .
Could he sink into one of his states ?
And that I was destroying his relationship with the violin ?
Could I , when I started talking about clay ladders and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic ?
Violin pedagogy . So I just started .
Play . I played the first sentence of Beethoven .
Violin Concerto . And while I was playing , I noticed that in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes , there was a complete change .
It was as if he was under the influence of an invisible doctor .
A chemical reaction , whose catalyst was my game , turned Nathaniel &apos;s maniac anger .
Moving into understanding , into a calm curiosity and grace , and like a miracle , he took his violin .
And he began to listen .
Some excerpts of violin concerts to play .
And then asked me to finish them .
To play Mendelssohn , Tchaikovsky , Sibelius , we started playing about music .
To talk about , starting with Bach .
To talk about Beethoven , Brahms , Bruckner and all the other BS of Bartók .
To ESA @-@ Pekka Salonen , and I realized that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music .
But he also had a close personal relationship with her .
He talked about her .
He talked about her with a passion and an understanding that I usually only had from my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic .
Knowing by playing music .
And talking about music was this paranoid , confused man .
He was just pulled through the streets of Los Angeles .
A lovely , educated man .
Excellent at Juilliard .
Teacher @ musication.
Have become
( Music )
Is medicine ?
( Music ) Changes
For Nathaniel , music means music .
Eligible health , because music allows him to use his imagination and creativity to create his thoughts and delusions .
Reform into something real , and so he escapes his torment .
Status : I understood that this is the essence of art .
This is precisely why we make music .
So that we can make something deep inside of us all .
Our emotions through our artistic lens , through our creativity , into reality .
Forms can and the reality of that expression .
It reaches us all .
And moves , inspires .
And unites us what Nathaniel was about .
So the music brought him .
Back to a community .
Friends , the redeeming power of the music brought him back .
To a family of musicians who understood him , who recognized his talent .
And he respected him , and I will play with Nathaniel again and again .
Whether in Walt Disney Concert Hall or in Skid Row , because he reminds me why I became a musician .
Thank you very much .
Bruno Giussani : Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Robert Gupta : Robert Gupta : I want to play something .
I shamefully stolen the cellist .
I hope you forgive me . I &apos;m Jane McGonigal . I design computer games . I develop .
I &apos;ve been developing for 10 years now .
Online games and my goal for the next decade .
Is it just as easy to make ?
Save the world in reality .
How to save it in online games is , I have a plan for it .
I want to convince more people .
Including all of you , more time playing bigger and more amazing .
Spend games , we &apos;re spending three billion hours a week now .
With online games , some of you might think , &quot; This is a lot .
Time for games , maybe too much . &quot;
Time , considering how many problems we &apos;re going to solve urgently in the real world .
But in fact , according to my research at the Institute for the Future , that &apos;s exactly the opposite .
Right ? Three billion hours a week .
Are not nearly enough ?
To solve the world &apos;s most pressing problems , in fact , I &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we &apos;re going to have this time drastically .
I &apos;ve calculated .
That the time needed is 21 billion hours a week of play time , that may seem a little bit absurd first .
So I repeat , so that it can work if we can solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity .
I think we need to try and play online for at least 21 billion hours a week by the end of the next decade .
No .
I mean , it &apos;s really .
Ernst .
Why ?
This picture quite accurately describes why .
I think games are so vital to the survival of the human species in the future .
Are they serious ? This is a portrait of the photographer .
Phil Toledano : He wanted to capture the feelings of playing .
So he built a camera in front of the players .
This is one of the classic expressions of playing .
If you &apos;re not a player , you may miss some of the nuances in this picture .
You probably see this sense of urgency .
A little bit of fear .
But also extreme concentration , deeply deepened .
Solving a really difficult problem , even if you &apos;re playing .
See some nuances .
Here &apos;s the upward .
Eyes drawn .
And the mouth is a sign of optimism .
The eyebrows show surprise . This is a player on the edge of what &apos;s called an epic victory .
Oh , you know that ? OK .
Great .
So we have some players here . An epic victory is .
One result that &apos;s so extraordinarily positive that they didn &apos;t even know before that it was possible at all .
It was almost beyond imagination .
And if you get there , you &apos;re shocked that you &apos;re actually capable of doing that .
This is an epical victory .
This player is about to be an epic .
Victory , and this is what we see on millions of faces of problem solvers around the world .
Must we tackle the hurdles of the next century , the face of those who face the edge of an epic , contrary to all odds ?
Victory is , unfortunately , standing .
We see this face more .
In real life , when we face difficult problems , I call it &quot; being in life . &quot;
I mean , bad face .
And it &apos;s actually my face .
Look , yeah .
OK .
That &apos;s me .
How I &apos;m in life .
I &apos;m bad face .
Do this . This is a graffiti .
In my former home country in Berkeley , California , where I studied in my Ph.D. thesis why we &apos;re better at playing .
Than in real life , that &apos;s a problem .
That &apos;s a lot of players , we think we &apos;re not so good at reality .
Like in play .
And I mean , not only less successful .
Although that &apos;s part of it , we &apos;re getting more in play worlds , I mean good in connection .
Inspired in collaboration with each other by the motivation to do something meaningful when we &apos;re in a game world .
I think many of us are turning into our best version .
Anytime and immediately , helpful , persistent .
The problem to solve is to try to try again as long as necessary after failure , and in reality , when we fail , when we encounter obstacles .
We often feel different .
We feel overwhelmed .
We feel defeated .
We feel threatened .
Maybe depressed .
Frustrated , right ?
Cynical , these feelings have .
We never , when we play games , in games , they just exist .
Not , and that &apos;s it .
What I wanted to study as a PhD student is , why is it in games ?
Impossible .
Thinking you couldn &apos;t just achieve everything .
How can we put these feelings from games into reality ?
So I looked at games like &quot; World of Warcraft . &quot;
This provides the ideal environment for solving problems in a community , and I noticed a few things : Epic victories .
So in online worlds , making it possible , first of all , when you enter one of these online games , especially at World of Warcraft .
Are there a lot of different characters ?
They &apos;re ready to give you a world saving .
Mission , immediately , but not .
Just some mission , but a mission .
Perfect to your current level in the game .
Right ?
So they do .
They never get a task .
They can &apos;t solve it .
But always on the edge of their abilities , so they have to make an effort , but there &apos;s no unemployment .
In World of Warcraft , you &apos;re not sitting around .
And they turn around , dams .
They always have a very specific focus .
Something important .
To do , and there are a couple of times .
Staff members , wherever they go .
Hundreds of thousands of people working with them to complete their epic mission , we have in real life .
Not so easy .
This feeling that , when you have fingerprints , staff are willing to do it in ways that are available , and there are also :
It &apos;s this epic story .
It &apos;s this inspiring story , why we &apos;re there .
And what we have to do is we get this whole positive story .
Feedback . You &apos;ve certainly got from level .
Up and 1 .
Strength .
Listened .
Or
1 .
Intelligence .
This constant feedback .
Is there not ?
In real life , when I leave this stage , I don &apos;t .
1 . Speak and 1 .
Crazy idea .
20 .
Crazy .
Idea .
I get in real life .
This feedback , not so the problem of collaborative online worlds like World of Warcraft .
Is it so satisfying ?
Anytime on the edge of an epic victory .
To stand by that we prefer to spend all our time in these game worlds , they &apos;re just better .
As reality , to date , all World of Warcraft players have in common .
5.93 million years have spent solving the virtual problems of Azeroth .
That &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
It may sound bad .
But to look at it in context , 5.93 million years ago .
We started to erect our first primate ancestors .
So the first erect primacy , OK ?
So when we talk about how much time we spend playing at the moment .
Does that make sense ?
When do you get to know the time for the scale of human development ?
Well , what &apos;s extraordinary , but also appropriate .
Because it turns out that by going on playing all this time , we &apos;re playing .
In fact , changing what we as humans are able to do .
We &apos;re becoming too community .
Thinking , heartfelt beings .
That &apos;s the truth .
I think you can look at this interesting statistic .
The recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University .
The average young person today spends in a country with a strong playing culture .
10,000 hours playing online until the age of 21 .
So 10,000 hours is a very interesting number .
For two reasons : First , for children .
In the United States , 10,080 hours is the exact total time they spend in school .
From fifth grade to high school .
If you never miss it , so here &apos;s a complete parallel education path where young people learn the same thing that it means .
Being a good player , like anything else they learn in school .
And maybe some of you have overflying the new book by Malcolm Gladwell .
So you know his theory .
Of success , the theory of success , the 10,000 @-@ hour theory .
It &apos;s based on the great one .
Cognitive science research that if we spend 10,000 hours studying any subject with the laborious age of 21 , you know ?
We &apos;ll be able to master .
In that , we &apos;ll be as good at whatever .
To do as the most important people in the world , what we have here .
Is a complete generation ?
Young people , the master players , are the big question .
So , what exactly are players ?
Masterly good .
Because if we could figure out that out , we would have never known anything before .
Human potential available : So many people in the world right now , we have at least an hour a day playing online , and these are our master players , 500 million people .
They &apos;re exceptionally good at something , and they &apos;re extraordinary in the next decade .
Do we have another billion ?
Players that are exceptionally good ?
Anyway , if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
Have the gaming industry developed ?
Consoles , the energy .
Save and work on mobile networks .
Instead of broadband Internet , so that players around the world , especially in India , China .
Brazil can play online , you can expect .
An additional billion players over the next decade , so we &apos;ve got a total of 1.5 billion players , so I started .
Thinking about what it is , what we can master these games .
Here &apos;s the four .
Things I found first : Urgency optimism , OK ?
Imagine how extreme self @-@ motivation .
Urgent optimism is desire .
Immediately to do something .
Mastery a hurdle , along with believing that we have a reasonable hope of success .
Players always believe that an epical victory is possible .
And that it &apos;s always worth trying .
And that &apos;s equal to players .
Don &apos;t sit around .
Players are champions in spiders .
Poet social networks . There &apos;s a lot of interesting research .
They show that we like people more after we &apos;ve played with them .
Even if they &apos;ve defeated us badly , the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust .
To play with someone a game , we trust someone will spend time with us .
That the rules are being respected , that we have the same goal .
And to the end of the game , so playing together allows us to grow ties , trust and coexistence as a result .
We build stronger social relationships .
We build on happy productivity .
Fantastic .
You know , there &apos;s one reason why the average word of warcraft player plays 22 hours a week .
So as part @-@ time job , the reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier at it .
Working hard than when we relax .
Or nothing .
Do we know that we work optimally as human beings ?
When we do hard , significant work , and players are always ready .
Working hard .
When they get the right job and eventually love epic meaning , players .
It &apos;s part of awe @-@ inspiring .
Planetary Dimensions Missions .
So here &apos;s a background information to get this right .
You probably know all Wikipedia .
The biggest Wiki in the world , the second largest Wiki .
The world with almost 80,000 entries .
Is the World of Warcraft ?
Wiki : Five million people use it every month .
They have more information .
They &apos;ve collected more information about World of Warcraft online than about any other topic .
In any other Wiki in the world , they &apos;re creating an epic .
History : They &apos;re creating an epic .
Source of knowledge about the World of Warcraft : OK .
So these are four superpowers .
They lead to a single result : Players are super @-@ powerful , hopeful .
Individuals : They &apos;re people who believe that as individuals they can change the world .
And the only problem is they believe they can change the virtual worlds .
But not the real ones . That &apos;s the problem .
The one I &apos;m trying to solve is Edward Castronova .
A scientist , his work .
Is awesome ?
He &apos;s studying why .
People have so much time .
Energy and money .
In online worlds , he says , &quot; We are witnessing no less than mass migration to virtual worlds . &quot;
And online gaming environments , and this from an economist , so he &apos;s logical .
And he doesn &apos;t say , &quot; Like I &apos;m developing games , I &apos;m a little exuberant . &quot;
So he says , &quot; That makes sense , in fact . &quot;
Because players can achieve more in online worlds than in real life .
They can build stronger social ties in games .
As in real life , they get more feedback .
And rewards in games than they do in real life , so he says , &quot; It &apos;s perfectly logical right now . &quot;
That players have more time in the virtual world than they have in real life .
I &apos;ll just agree .
That &apos;s logical .
But it &apos;s definitely .
It &apos;s not an optimal situation .
We have to start turning the real world into a game .
My inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s been back 2,500 years .
There are these ancient cubes of sheep &apos;s cocks , you know ?
Before these fantastic game econtrollers , there were sheep &apos;s cocks , and these were , so to speak , the first of people to develop .
Play equipment , and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus , you might know this story .
The story about how and why ?
Play was invented according to Herodotus .
Play more precisely craps in the kingdom of Lydia during famine .
It was said there was such a great famine .
That the king of Lydia decided to become a crazy idea , people suffered , people fought .
It was an extreme situation .
It took an extreme solution .
So , according to Herodotus , they invented the craps and agreed a national strategy .
In one day you would eat .
The next day you would play , and they would play so much into the craps .
You &apos;d be deepened there .
Games so fascinating .
Are and we &apos;re more satisfying .
Happy productivity .
Surrounded by that , you would forget .
There was nothing to eat .
And then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat , and according to Herodotus , you would survive .
For 18 years , you would have this famine .
By eating one day and playing the next , I think the same .
Let &apos;s put in games today , we put in games to help the suffering of the real world .
We put in games to escape everything .
It doesn &apos;t work in the real world .
It works for everything in real life .
It &apos;s not satisfying .
It &apos;s what we need , and we get what we need .
It &apos;s from the games , but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
That &apos;s the exciting thing , loud , Herodotus .
After 18 years of famine , the king decided to start a final dice game , and they divided the kingdom into two halves .
They played a dice game .
And the winners were allowed to be an epic adventure .
They left lydia and they went looking for it .
A new home . They just left as many people as there were food to survive .
And they went to the rest of them looking for an area where they thrive .
Could that sound crazy ?
Or , latest DNA evidence ?
Show that the Etruscans who later formed the Roman Empire , the same DNA as the old Lydians .
So scientists recently came to the conclusion that herodotus is indeed a crazy story .
And geologists found evidence of global cooling .
It took almost 20 years to explain the famine .
So could this crazy story be true ?
Maybe they actually have their people through play .
Saved .
By fleeing games for 18 years , and then having that inspiration .
And so much about coexistence .
Play learned that it saved the whole civilization .
So we can play that as well .
Since 1994 Warcraft , that was the first strategy game .
In real time , the World of Warcraft series , that was 16 years ago .
They played for 18 years .
Craps , we &apos;ve been playing for 16 years .
Warcraft : I claim we &apos;re ready .
So for our own epic game , they sent half of their civilization .
They were looking for a new world , so I take my 21 billion hours of play a week .
We should agree that half of us have an hour of play a day .
Until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world .
I know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; How do we solve problems of the real world ? &quot;
In games , and that &apos;s exactly the question I &apos;ve been working on in recent years at the Institute for the Future .
We have this banner in our office .
In Palo Alto , it expresses how we understand the future .
Should we not try ?
The future of saying what we want before is the future .
To create , we want the best possible outcome .
Imagine , and then empower people to do it .
To turn that idea into reality , we face epic victories .
Imagine and give people the opportunity to reach them .
Let me show you very briefly .
Three games I designed .
Have to try to make people epic victories in their own future .
This is world .
Without oil , the game .
Is from 2007 ? It &apos;s an online game .
In which you have to overcome an oil shortage , oil scarcity is invented .
But we have enough online content to make it realistic for you .
And you actually , your real life without oil .
So , live when you sign up for the game .
Tell us where you live .
And then you get real @-@ time news movies .
They show you how much oil costs .
What &apos;s not there , how food supplies are affected , how transport costs .
Whether schools are closed .
Are there riots ?
And you have to figure out how to shape your real life .
If it were true , and we ask you to blog about it .
So , to set up videos or photos , we have this one @-@ game game .
700 players .
We tested it in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompanying it for the last three years .
And I can tell you , it was a changing experience .
Nobody wants his life .
Change because it &apos;s good for the environment .
Or because we should .
But if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and you &apos;re told , &quot; We &apos;re going to get the oil out . &quot;
This is a fascinating thing .
Adventure .
You find the way you &apos;re going .
You figure out how you survive .
Would most of our players have it ?
Keep the habits learned in the game .
So we &apos;ve got a bigger , higher goal for the next world saving game .
We &apos;ve just put oil scarcity . We &apos;ve got the game .
Superstruct at the Institute .
For the future .
Designed starting point .
Is the calculation ?
A supercomputer that humans only have 23 years left on the planet .
This supercomputer is called the Global Dismortality Sensitization System , of course , the call .
To players to sign up .
Did we almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie ?
You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies , where there &apos;s the dream team .
You have the astronaut , the scientist , the ex @-@ Sträfling , and just together .
Can you save the world ?
But in our game , instead of just five people , we say , &quot; Everyone is on the dream team , and it &apos;s our job . &quot;
The future for energy , food , health .
Security and the future of social justice . 8,000 players played the game .
For weeks , they found 500 incredible .
Creative solutions that they can read when they Google Superstruct and bring the last game .
We released March 3rd . It &apos;s a game .
Working with the World Bank when you complete the game , you get .
You get the World Bank Award for Social Reformer 2010 . We work with universities .
All over Sub @-@ Saharan Africa , and invite you to redesign socially .
Learning : We have a comic book on this . We have levels high for regional understanding .
Knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
I want to invite you all to share this game with young people .
All over the world , especially in development areas , that benefit from it .
Imagine , together , your own social ventures to save the world .
So I &apos;m going to finish .
I want to ask you something .
What do you think ?
Next happens ?
We have all these fantastic players .
We have games that show us what we do .
But can we not have saved the real world yet ?
Well , I hope you agree with me that players are human resources .
We can use them to work in real life , and that games have a great significance for change .
We have all these superpowers , happy productivity .
The ability to build tight social networks , urgency optimism and the desire for epics .
Importance : I really hope that together we play important games .
To survive another century on this planet , and I hope you will play with me like this .
Design and play .
When I look forward to the next decade , I &apos;m on two things .
Certainly , we can create every imaginable future and we can play all kinds of games .
So can I say , let &apos;s play the world @-@ changing games .
Let &apos;s start . Thank you .
I &apos;ve been interested in Placebo for some time now . It may seem strange .
It may seem that a magician is interested in it unless you look at it as a deception that becomes something real .
If someone just believes it hard enough , in other words , sugar pills have had measurable effects in some studies .
The placebo effect , and that &apos;s just because the person thinks what happens to her .
Be a pharmaceutical .
Or a kind of pain management .
For example , if the patient believes it hard enough , there &apos;s a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect .
A deception .
Will become something real ?
Because somebody perceives it like this .
So that we understand each other , I want to give you an elementary , very simple magic trick .
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works .
This is a trick .
It &apos;s been a trick that , at least since the 1950s , has been in every magic book for kids .
I myself have it from the Cub Scout Magic .
The scout in the 1970s , I &apos;m going to do it for you .
And then explain it , and then I &apos;m going to explain it .
Why ?
I explain it .
So you see what happens .
The knife you can look at , my hand you &apos;re looking at .
Can I just hold the knife in my fist like that ?
I &apos;m pushing my sleeves back .
And to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeves or comes out of it .
Will I just push my wrist right here ?
So you can see that .
You can &apos;t move anything at any time , as long as I &apos;m pressurizing here .
Can &apos;t move in my sleeves ?
Or come out , and the goal is , quite simply , I &apos;m going to open my hand .
And hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife will be through my bare physical magnetism .
It &apos;s actually stuck so tight .
In its place , I can shake it .
Without the knife falling down , nothing moves .
In my sleeves , or comes out , no trickery , and you can study everything .
TA @-@ DA : Well , this is a trick that I often teach small kids .
They &apos;re interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception .
If you look more closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick to do .
I think many of you in this room probably know .
This trick , it works .
Here &apos;s how I hold the knife .
In my hand , I say I &apos;m closing my wrist to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeve .
Or comes out , and this is a lie .
The reason I &apos;m holding my wrist is because it &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
The moment I turn my hand away from you .
So that you see it from behind , this finger moves here .
My index finger just moves from there .
Where it was , in a position where it &apos;s stretched out like this .
Great trick .
There &apos;s somebody sitting back there who had no childhood , so he &apos;s right here , and when I turn around , the finger changes its position , and now you could talk about it .
Why ?
The one thing is deception . Why ?
You don &apos;t perceive .
That &apos;s just three fingers down here .
Because the mind and the way it processes information are not individually .
Number one , two , three .
It &apos;s a group that sees it , but that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about .
Now , here , actually , not at all .
And then I open my hand , of course , it &apos;s held there .
But not by magnetism .
My body , but by a trick .
By my index finger , which is there now , and when I close my hand , the same thing happens by turning back .
By this movement , it &apos;s hidden that the finger is moving back , I take that hand away .
And here &apos;s the knife .
This trick you can show to your friends and neighbors .
Thank you .
Now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ?
A year ago or so , I read a study that really bypassed me .
Does I not have a doctor ?
Or a researcher , and that &apos;s why it was for me .
It was an amazing thing .
Because what it turned out is that if you offer a placebo in the form of a white pill , you can see that there &apos;s a placebo .
In the form of an aspirin tablet , that &apos;s easy .
A round white pill .
It has a certain measurable effect , but if you give the shape in which you give the placebo , for example , to a smaller pill , you change it .
And you color this blue and you embosse a letter on it , it &apos;s actually measurable .
More effective , and that &apos;s even though none of these are any pharmaceutical ones .
Just sugar pills , but a white pill is not so good .
Like a blue pill , which made it .
Really ?
Flipping out , but it turned out that &apos;s not all that .
If you take capsules , they &apos;re even more effective than tablets of any shape .
A colored capsule that &apos;s yellow at one end and red at the other .
Is better than a white one ?
Capsule : The dosage .
Does it matter ?
A pill twice .
Not so good every day .
Like three pills , I can &apos;t remember the exact statistics now .
Sorry .
But the key thing is that dosage also matters .
And shape matters .
And if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to grab the needle .
Right ?
A syringe .
With an ineffective one , a few milliliters , an ineffective one .
Substance that you inject into a patient , which creates a very strong image .
In your head , that &apos;s a lot .
Stronger than a white pill . This graph is really , I &apos;m going to show you another time .
So if we have a projector , the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work so well .
Like the blue pill , which doesn &apos;t work so well .
Like a capsule .
Not so good .
It works like the needle .
And none of it .
Does any really pharmaceutical ?
Feature : It &apos;s just our belief in it .
It &apos;s having a stronger effect in us .
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a magic trick .
Could I take something that is obviously a deception ?
And let it be real .
Look , we know .
From that study , you have to grab the needle when it comes to the matter .
Should this be an 18 @-@ inch @-@ long needle ?
It &apos;s very , very sharp .
And I &apos;m going to sterilize it a little bit first .
This is really my flesh .
It &apos;s not Damian &apos;s .
Special bred meat , this one .
Is my skin ?
This is not a special effect .
Hollywood : I &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin .
And drive through it until it leaves on the other side .
If it gets you wrong , if you &apos;re easily fainted , I have some friends .
Last night .
Shown in the hotel room and some people I didn &apos;t know , and there &apos;s a woman almost fainthearted .
So I propose , if you &apos;re getting sick quickly , look for the next 30 seconds away .
Or you know what ?
I &apos;m going to do the first delicate part here in the back .
You can see it in a moment .
But you can also look away if you want .
So , it &apos;s going to be so accurate here .
Where my meat starts , at the bottom of my arm , I &apos;m just going to make a little bit of a break .
Do I really ?
Sorry .
That &apos;s crazy .
And now , just .
A little bit .
Through my skin and on the other side , back out like this .
Now we &apos;re actually in the same situation .
We had the knife trick , about , but now you can &apos;t count my fingers .
Or so I &apos;m going to show you .
This is one , two , three , four , five . Well , yeah .
I know what people think .
If you see that , you say , &quot; Okay . &quot;
That &apos;s certain .
Not so .
Bold and pierce yourself .
Skin just to entertain us for a few minutes .
Now , then I &apos;ll show you .
What does this look like ?
Very good .
Yes .
I know , and people in the back .
Say , okay .
I don &apos;t have that right .
See .
People in the side rooms are now coming in .
Let me tell you .
Close up , this is really my skin .
This is not a special effect .
Hollywood , this is my flesh .
And I can turn this around .
Sorry if you &apos;re getting bad , look away .
Don &apos;t look .
Go .
The people in the back , or those who see this sometime on video .
Will say , &quot; Well , that looks pretty good . &quot;
Impressive .
But if it were real , he would see , &quot; Here &apos;s a hole . &quot;
And there , if it was really real , it would bleed . Okay ?
Let me squeeze a little blood out for you .
Yeah .
Here it is .
Normally I would take out the needle now .
I would clean my arm .
And show you that there are no wounds there .
But I think in this frame here , and with the intention of doing that .
A deception , making something real .
Will I just put the needle in there ?
Let &apos;s go from the stage , we &apos;ll have a couple more meetings in the next few days .
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that .
Thank you very much .
So I &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
I just loved two .
This first one was more like a passionate affair .
It was a beautiful fish .
It was tasty , good consistency .
Hold , a bestseller .
On the menu , what a fish it got even better .
In aquaculture , according to the supposedly highest standards of sustainability , you could feel comfortable .
Selling it , I had a relationship with this beauty for several months . One day , the company &apos;s boss called and asked if I would be speaking at an event .
Could about the sustainability of the farm ? Of course , I said , &quot; Here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem became for our chefs .
Is it like , do we keep fish ?
On our menus over the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the seas .
How we &apos;ve been barking forests , it &apos;s hard to overestimate destruction .
90 percent of the big fish we love , the tuna , the curative butte , the salmon , the swordfish .
They &apos;ve collapsed .
It &apos;s almost nothing more .
So , there &apos;s probably some aquaculture left , or bad aquaculture .
Fish farming , part of our future .
His many arguments against it .
Fish farming plants pollute the environment , most of them anyway , and they &apos;re inefficient .
Let &apos;s take tuna .
A big disadvantage .
It &apos;s got 15 to one feed recovery , which means 15 pounds of wild fish .
It &apos;s necessary to get one pound of farmed tuna , not very sustainable .
It doesn &apos;t taste very sustainable either .
Very good .
So here was finally a company .
It tried to get it right .
I wanted to support it .
The day before the event , I called the head of public relations for the company .
Let &apos;s call him Don , said .
I just said the facts .
Right ?
You &apos;re famous for that .
So far out in the sea .
Growing .
You don &apos;t pollute the environment . That &apos;s true .
He said , &quot; We &apos;re so far out that the waste is distributed by our fish . &quot;
Not concentrated .
And then he added , &quot;
We &apos;re basically a world of our own .
This 2.5 to one feed recovery , &quot; he said , &quot; the best in the industry , 2.5 . &quot;
&quot; One , great , 2.5 to one . What do you feed ? &quot; &quot; Sustainable proteins , &quot; he said . &quot; Great . &quot; I said , &quot; I got up , and that evening I lay in bed and thought , &quot; What the hell ? &quot;
&quot; Is sustainable ? &quot;
Protein . &quot; So the next day , just before the event , I called .
Don : I said , &quot; Don , what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
He said , &quot; He doesn &apos;t know . &quot;
He &apos;ll ask , &quot; Well , I telephoned a few people in the company , nobody could give me a proper answer . &quot;
Until I finally telephoned with the leading biologist , let &apos;s call him .
Don Don , too , I said , &quot; What , for example , are they ? &quot;
Sustainable proteins . Well , he mentioned some algae .
And some fishmeal , and then he said , &quot; Chicken pellets . &quot; I said , chicken pellets . He said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Feathers , skin .
Bone flour .
Remnants .
Dried and foraged .
Processed . I said , &quot; How much percent of your food ? &quot;
Is chicken , assuming maybe two percent ? Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent .
He said , &quot; I said , don , what &apos;s sustainable ? &quot;
&quot; Feeding chicken to fish . &quot;
There was a long break .
In the lead , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much .
Chicken in the world . &quot; I fell in love with this fish .
No .
Not .
Because I &apos;m a self @-@ righteous connoisseur and a good man .
That &apos;s me .
Even no .
I &apos;m actually smashed of this fish .
Loved because I swear to God , the fish , after this conversation , tasted chicken .
Has this second fish ? That &apos;s another fish .
Type of love story . It &apos;s the romantic species . The way you ever know your fish .
Do you learn the fish ?
The more you love it .
I first ate it in a restaurant in southern Spain .
A friend journalist .
She had long been talking about this fish .

It kind of cuffed us , and it came on the table .
It was with a bright , almost shimmering white color .
The cook had cooked it , just twice . Amazingly , it was still .
Delicious .
Who can make a fish ?
So good .
Taste .
After it was cooked , I can &apos;t , but this guy can call it .
We call it Miguel .
In fact , it &apos;s called Miguel .
And no .
He doesn &apos;t have the fish .
Chewed .
And he &apos;s not a chef .
At least in the way you and I understand it , he &apos;s a biologist at Veta .
La Palma , that &apos;s a fish rearing in the southwest .
Corner of Spain , it &apos;s near the mouth .
The river Guadalquivir , until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of Argentines , they grew meat cattle on what were essentially wetlands .
They did that by draining the land .
They built this complicated sequence of canals , and they pushed water out of the country .
And out into the river . Well , they couldn &apos;t make a difference .
That didn &apos;t work economically and ecologically .
It was a disaster . It brought about 90 percent .
The birds around , which is a lot of birds in this place .
And so in 1982 , a Spanish company with environmental awareness bought the land . What did they do ?
They reversed the river of water .
They literally relaid the lever .
Instead of pushing out the water , they used the channels to pull the water back in .
They flooded the channels .
They created an 11,000 hectares .
Fish farming , perch , sea ash , shrimp .
Eel .
And so Miguel and his company completely reversed the ecological destruction .
The farm is incredible .
I mean , they &apos;ve never seen anything like this before .
They &apos;re staring out .
They &apos;re on the horizon .
One million miles away .
Is , and everything you see is flooded .
Channels and this dense , lush march . I was there not long ago .
With Miguel , he &apos;s an incredible guy .
Three parts : Charles Darwin and one part : A crocodile .
To kiss , okay , there we were and fought .
We were through wetlands , and I chash and sweat , I have mud to my knees , and Miguel keeps quiet .
A biology lecture here , he highlights a rare track .
Now he mentions the mineral needs of phytoplankton , and here he sees a pattern .
Of bundles that he &apos;s looking at .
The Tanzanian giraffe reminds us .
It turns out Miguel has most of his career in Mikumi National Park in Africa .
I asked him how he became such a fish expert .
He said , &quot; Fish , I don &apos;t know .
On fish , I &apos;m an expert in relationships .
And then he goes and falls into more talk . &quot;
Rare birds and algae and strange aquatic plants , and you know ?
Not wrong .
It was really fascinating .
You know , the biotic community , unplugged , like this , it &apos;s great , but I was in love .
And my head got weak .
Over this cooked piece of delicious fish that I had on the eve .
So I interrupted it .
I said , Miguel .
How does it come about ?
That your fish tastes so good .
He pointed to algae . I know boy , the algae of phytoplankton .
The relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
But what do your fish eat ?
How is the feed recovery ? Well , he goes on .
To tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system .
That the fish eat what they would eat in the wilderness .
The vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , that &apos;s what the fish feed .
The system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self @-@ explanatory .
There &apos;s no food .
Ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , later on the day .
I drove on this plot with Miguel .
Around .
And I asked him , &quot; I said , for a place that seems so natural , unlike any farm .
On which I &apos;ve ever been , how do you measure success ? &quot;
The moment it was , a film director asked for a stage change .
And we bowed around the corner , and we had the most incredible sight .
Thousands and thousands of pinkers flamingos .
A literally pinker .
Carpet as far as the eye is .
Is that enough ? Is that success ?
He said , &quot; Look at her bellies . &quot;
Pink .
They &apos;re smuggling , slugging .
I was completely confused .
I said Miguel .
Don &apos;t mess .
Your fish .
Yes .
He said , &quot;
We &apos;re losing 20 . &quot;
Percent of our fish and fish eggs to the birds .
Now , last year , there were 600,000 birds on this site .
More than 250 different species .
It &apos;s the largest and one of the most important private bird reserves in Europe today .
I &apos;ve become a well @-@ thriving bird population , not the last one to be reared on a fish farm .
If he wants to shook his head , no .
He said , &quot; We &apos;re building extensively , not .
Intensive . This is what we &apos;re building . &quot;
Is an ecological network ?
The flamingos eat the shrimps .
The shrimps eat the phytoplankton , so the closer the belly , the better the system . Okay ?
Let &apos;s think about that .
A farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals .
And a farm that measures its success in the health of its predators .
A fish rearing , but also a bird reserve . Oh , and by the way , these flamingos shouldn &apos;t even be there from the outset .
They breed in a city 240 kilometers away .
Where the soil is better for nest maintenance , fly every morning .
They fly 240 kilometers to the farm .
And every night they fly 240 kilometers .
Back , they do that because they follow the dotted white line of the A92 highway .
Seriously , I had imagined a kind of penguins journey .
So I looked at Miguel . I said Miguel .
Fly 240 .
Kilometers to the farm , and then fly them .
240 kilometers back in the evening .
Do that for the kids .
He looked at me as if I had just quoted a song by Whitney Houston , and he said , &quot; No , you &apos;re doing that .
Because the food is better . &quot;
I don &apos;t have the skin of my lover .
I mentioned fish .
The delicious .
Was not , and I don &apos;t like , fish skin .
I like it .
Not sauté .
I like it .
Not .
Chespy .
It &apos;s this biting .
Cooked taste : I almost never cook with it , and yet , when I tried it in this restaurant in southern Spain , it doesn &apos;t have fish skin at all .
It tasted sweet .
And it &apos;s as if you were taking a bite from the ocean .
I mentioned that to Miguel , and he nodded , he said , &quot; The skin looks like a sponge . &quot;
It &apos;s the last defense .
Before anything enters the body , it &apos;s evolved over the course of evolution .
To suck up impurities , and then he added , &quot; But our water has no impurities . &quot;
Okay .
A farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish .
A farm that measures its success in the success of its predators .
And then I realized when he said , &quot; A farm that doesn &apos;t have impurities , it undermines enormously . &quot;
Because the water that flows through this farm comes from the Guadalquivir River .
In . It &apos;s a river .
It carries with it all the things that rivers nowadays tend to bring with them .
Chemical pollutants , outflow of pesticides , and when it &apos;s fought through the system and it leaves , the water is .
Cleaner than it &apos;s come in , the system is so healthy .
It cleans the water .
So , not just a farm .
It doesn &apos;t feed its animals , not just a farm that measures its success in the health of its predators .
It &apos;s a farm that is literally a water treatment plant , not just for these fish , but for you as well .
And me , because when the water flows out , it sinks into the Atlantic , a drop in the ocean , I know , but I take it , and you should .
Because this love story , however romantic , is .
It &apos;s also telling .
You could say it &apos;s a recipe for the future .
Good food , whether we &apos;re talking about beef or meat cattle , what we need now .
Is it radically new ?
The concept of agriculture , of a food that actually tastes good .
But for many people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
We &apos;re not realists .
We enjoy .
We love love weekly markets .
We love small family farms .
We talk about regional food . We eat organic food . And if you say that &apos;s the stuff that insure the future of good food .
Does anybody stand up somewhere and say , &quot; Hey guys , I love pink . &quot;
Flamingos : But how are you going to feed the world ?
How are you going to feed the world ?
Can I be honest .
I like this question .
Not no .
Not .
Because we &apos;re already producing enough calories .
To feed the world more than just one billion people .
Today , a billion are starving , that &apos;s more than ever before .
Because of stark inequalities in distribution , not total production .
Now , I like this question .
Not because you &apos;ve been defining the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
Feed grain .
Vegetable pesticides , monocultures , chemicals , the Earth .
Chicken of fish , and all the time , the agricultural industry has just asked .
If we feed more people cheaper , how terrible can that be ?
That was the reason . It was the justification . It was the business plan .
American agriculture . We should call it .
What it is a business in liquidation , a business that quickly takes up ecological capital that allows that very production . That &apos;s not a business .
And it &apos;s not agriculture .
Our grain chamber is threatened today .
Not because of decreasing .
Supply , but because of decreasing resources .
Not by the latest mower and tractor inventions , but by fertile ones .
Land , not by pumps , but by fresh ones .
Water , not by chainsaws .
It &apos;s by forests .
And not by fishing boats .
And nets , but by fish in the sea . They want to feed the world .
Let &apos;s start with the question : How are we going to feed ourselves ?
Or better .
How can we create conditions ?
Which each community can feed itself to do that .
Don &apos;t look at the agricultural industrial model for the future .
It &apos;s really old .
And it &apos;s done .
Capital , chemistry and machines .
They &apos;re on top of it .
And it never has anything really good to eat .
Instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
This is the one that has two billion years of work experience .
Take a look back at Miguel .
Farmers like Miguel .
Farmers like Miguel . Farms that don &apos;t have worlds for themselves .
Are farms that restore ?
Instead of using up farms that grow extensively , instead of just intensive farmers who are not just producers .
They are experts on relationships .
Because they are the ones who are experts on taste .
And if I &apos;m really honest , they &apos;re a better cook .
When I ever will be , you know , I &apos;m right .
Because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
Thank you .
I grew up with a lot .
Portion of science fiction . In my school days , I drove by bus .
To school , every day , an hour per way .
And my nose was always in a book .
A science fiction book , my thoughts .
Absorbing into other worlds and telling my deep .
Insaturable curiosity in me .
Satisfied that curiosity .
Also , it showed up in it .
That whenever I wasn &apos;t in school , I would stretch through the woods .
Migrated and sampled frogs .
And snakes .
And beetle
And pond water , everything .
Bringing home and looking under the microscope , I was totally enthusiastic about science .
You know , it was always about trying .
Understanding the world and exploring the limits of what could be , and my love of science .
Fiction seemed to reflect in my surroundings , because back in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea .
Jacques Cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows .
They brought us animals and places and a world full of wonders .
We could never have imagined before , and that &apos;s probably a very good thing .
It was a science fiction role that I was an artist .
I could draw , I could paint , and because it wasn &apos;t video games , nor this saturation with computer @-@ generated films , nor the whole visual language .
In the media landscape , I had to create the images in my head .
That &apos;s what we all had to do back then . When we read a book as kids , we took the author &apos;s description and projected it .
The canvas in our heads , my reaction to it .
Was drawing and painting ?
From alien alien worlds , robots , spacecraft and all of that .
In math class , I was caught by the teacher all the time .
As I was painting hidden behind the textbook , creativity had to sort of get out .
And something interesting happened , which fascinated me with Jacques Cousteaus &apos; shows .
Was the idea of a world that we were completely unfamiliar with ?
Here on our planet , certainly , I would never reach an alien world with a spaceship .
That seemed pretty unlikely to me .
But here was a world that I could actually enter .
Here on Earth .
And it was just as fascinating .
And exotic as all of the things I &apos;d always imagined .
When I read these books , so when I was 15 , I decided to become a diver .
The only problem with this was that I lived in a small village in Canada .
1,000 kilometers from the next ocean .
Far from that .
Let &apos;s go .
But I didn &apos;t .
Discouraging .
I annoyed my father .
Until he finally found a diving school in Buffalo , New York .
Right on the other side of the border where we lived , I made my dive certificate in a pool .
The YMCA , right in the middle of winter in Buffalo , New York , the ocean .
But I got a real ocean only two years .
Later on , I saw it .
When we moved to California , since in the 40 years that have passed .
I &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours underwater .
500 hours of it in submersible boats , and I &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flatter oceans , is so rich in fascinating life .
Is it really hard to imagine how we think ?
Can nature &apos;s imagination know ?
No limits .
Quite unlike our own miserable .
Human imagination to this day , I find deepest awe .
For what I see on my dives and my love of the ocean .
Keep on at the same intensity as ever , when I then chose a profession as an adult .
It was filmmaking .
That seemed the best way to make my inner urge .
Tell stories with my need to create images .
Unify as a child drew .
I keep drawing comic books .
And so films were the way , pictures and stories .
Put them together . That fit .
Together , of course , the stories I chose were the stories .
From the science fiction field : Terminator Aliens .
And Abyss at Abyss .
Could I share my love for the underwater world and diving with filmmaking ?
So , intertwined .
So my two passions , sort of , are interesting .
Did Abyss happen ?
To solve a narrative problem in this movie , and that was , we had to create a kind of liquid water system .
Let &apos;s take back computer @-@ generated animation , CG .
What came out of this was the first computer @-@ generated soft surface figure .
The one that was ever seen in a movie , the film didn &apos;t bring money .
In fact , it just played its production costs .
But I noticed something fascinating .
The audience around the world was hypnotized .
The magic that was thought to be Arthur Clarke &apos;s law , as you know , advanced technology .
And magic is no longer .
Differencing between them , so they saw something magical .
And I found that incredibly exciting .
And I thought , &quot; Wow , that absolutely must be involved in film art . &quot;
So we went to Terminator .
Two more movies to my next movie .
Together with ILM , we created the guy there .
Liquid metal . Success depended entirely on that .
How that effect would arrive and it worked .
Again , we had created something magical .
And the effect in the audience was the same , but we already recorded a little more money with the film from these two experiences .
So starting with this , it was a whole new world .
It reached a whole new world .
So creativity for filmmakers , I started a company with my good friend Stan Winston , who at that time was the best make @-@ up and creature designer , called Digital Domain .
The basic idea of this company was to start the phase of analog processes .
Skip with optical printers , etc . , and start with digital productions .
We did .
Then we did , and we also , for a while , got a competitive advantage .
But in the mid @-@ 1990s , we realized that we were in the Creature and Character Design , for which we actually founded the company .
We were moving too slowly . I had this piece Avatar .
It was written .
It was the benchmark for visual effects and computer @-@ generated effects at all new heights .
It was meant to push with realistic , human expressive characters made using CG .
And the main characters were supposed to be all CG .
And the world was supposed to be CG .
But the benchmark pretty much pushed back , and the people in my company told me that we &apos;re not yet able to do that for the time being .
So I shifted that , and I made this other movie .
Over the big ship that goes down , the film studio , I sold that as Romeo and Juliet on a ship .
It became a love movie of epic proportions , a passionate movie .
But in secret , I actually wanted to become a real wreck .
The Titanic , dip down , so I made the movie .
That &apos;s the truth .
The studio didn &apos;t know that .
But I convinced them by saying , &quot; We dive to the wreck . We film . &quot;
The real wreck , we &apos;ll show it in the opening sequence of the film .
That &apos;s incredibly important .
It &apos;s a good trailer .
For marketing , and I persuaded them to do an expedition .
Funding sounds crazy .
But that &apos;s okay again .
It &apos;s because your imagination creates a reality .
Can we actually create a reality six months later , where I was found in a Russian submersible ?
Four kilometers below the surface of the North Atlantic , and I looked at the real Titanic through a bullet .
This was not a movie .
No HD , this was real .
So this really blew me around .
And the preparations for this were enormous .
We had to build cameras and headlights and everything .
And I noticed how much these deep @-@ sea dive gears were .
A space mission looked like , &quot; Well , yeah .
They were also high @-@ tech .
And they needed extensive planning . You get up .
You get into this capsule . You float into this dark , hostile environment .
Down where there &apos;s no hope .
There &apos;s salvation if you don &apos;t get it back yourself . &quot; And I thought , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s the same as if I were in a science fiction movie . &quot;
That &apos;s really cool .
I was really obsessed .
I was obsessed with exploring the deep sea , at least the part that &apos;s related to curiosity and science .
Has it been ? It was all . It was adventure .
It was curiosity .
It was imagination .
And it was an experience .
I couldn &apos;t give Hollywood to me , because , you know , I could imagine a being for which we then create a visual effect .
But could I not imagine what I saw outside the window ?
If I were on some of the following expeditions , I saw beings in thermal springs .
And sometimes things I &apos;d never seen before , sometimes things that nobody had ever seen before .
And for those who were science at the time we saw them , not a word at all .
Found .
So that got me right .
Turned it around , and I wanted more , and so I met .
A little unusual .
Decision after success .
From Titanic , I said , okay .
I want my main job .
As a filmmaker in Hollywood , I &apos;m going to put on ice for a while , full @-@ time explorers , and then we started planning these expeditions .
We diving to Bismarck and exploring them with robotic vehicles , we went to the wreck .
The Titanic : We took small robots .
We built them that were running a fiberglass cable , and our intention was to do it .
Dive in and look inside the ship , which had never been done before .
Nobody had ever explored the inside of the wreck .
You haven &apos;t had any resources yet .
So we developed the technology to do that .
So , here &apos;s where I &apos;m sitting on the deck .
The Titanic .
In a submersible boat , and I see planks that are quite similar to these boards here .
And of those I know the band once played there .
And I &apos;m flying through the aisles with a little robot vehicle .
Of the ship , I &apos;m actually only operating it , but my consciousness is inside the vehicle .
It felt like I was physical .
Within the shipwreck of the Titanic , there was the surreal form .
One déjà vu I &apos;ve ever experienced , because before I was bogging around a corner , I always knew what was going to appear in the light cone of the vehicle .
Because I &apos;d been running over the movie set for months .
When we shot the film , the set was actually an exact copy .
So the ship &apos;s blueprints , that was a very strange one .
Experience : It made me realize this telepresence experience .
That you use robotic avatars like this , and so you put your consciousness into the vehicle in this different form .
It can move the existence . It was really incredibly profound .
And maybe a little bit of a view .
So what might happen in a few decades ?
Could if you have cyborg bodies to explore something ?
Or do other things ?
In all sorts of post @-@ human future scenarios that I can imagine as a science fiction fan .
After these expeditions , we started what we had seen down there .
Really ?
Learning to appreciate .
For example , these deep sea equals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals .
These are , like , aliens .
But here on Earth .
They live with chemosynthesis .
They don &apos;t exist in sunlight .
They exist in a system like we do that .
And this is how you see animals .
They &apos;re right next to a 500 degrees Celsius water cloud .
And you can &apos;t imagine they survive there .
Can interested people at the same time ?
I also really like space science , which was the science fiction influence again .
From my childhood , and so I ended up with people who are interested in space .
And they have to do with NASA and sit on NASA &apos;s expert board and plan real space missions .
They go to Russia .
They go through before the mission .
The biomedical protocol , including ,
Everything about it .
They then fly to the international .
Space Station and take our 3D camera systems with them . That was fascinating .
But in the end , it went on .
That I took space scientists with us into the deep sea , I took them with me , and I scaled them into the world .
Down there , astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in such extreme situations .
I took them to the sources so they could look around , take samples .
And test instruments , and so on .
We did documentary films , but actually did science , more specifically space science , so the circle closed .
Between my existence as a science fiction fan , then as a child , and implementation .
In reality , during this discovery journey , I learned a lot . I learned a lot about science .
But I also learned a lot about leadership .
Now you probably think a director must lead .
Can a leader be ?
Like a ship captain or something .
But I didn &apos;t understand much .
Leadership before I started these expeditions , because at a certain point I had to say , &quot; What do I do ? &quot;
Actually , here , why ?
Do I do that ?
What &apos;s going on ?
Well , these stupid movies don &apos;t bring us money .
One : We &apos;re just playing the production costs .
One of fame , no trace .
Everybody thinks I &apos;m between Titanic .
And Avatar walked away and somewhere I would have the nails on a towel .
I &apos;d been celebrating all these movies , these documentary films , for a very small audience .
Don &apos;t fame .
No honor .
No money .
What do you do ?
Only you do it .
For the sake of the task , for the sake of the challenge , and the ocean is the most challenging environment .
There are you , you make it of the exploratory noise .
Because of and because of the strange connection that emerges when a small group of people form a team .
Because we have all done this with just 10 to 12 people .
They &apos;ve worked together for years , and sometimes we &apos;ve been at sea for two to three months in a row and in this community .
Do you realize that the most important thing is respect that you have for each other ?
Because you &apos;ve done a job .
You can &apos;t explain that to anyone else when you return to land .
And you say , &quot; We had to do it . &quot;
The fiberglass , the sound attenuation , and all around it , the whole technology .
And the difficulties , the human performance .
When you work at sea , you can &apos;t explain that to the other .
This is like policemen or soldiers .
They &apos;ve gone through something in common , and they know they can never explain it to anybody .
And there &apos;s a connection .
So mutual respect comes out when I came back to my next movie , Avatar .
And I tried to use the same leadership style .
That is , you respect your team and in return deserve respect .
And that really changed the dynamics .
So I stood there again .
With a small team on unknown terrain , we turned Avatar with a new technology .
It wasn &apos;t before , incredibly exciting .
It was a tremendous challenge , and we became a real family for a period of four and a half years .
And that changed my way of making films .
It completely changed .
There were people who thought we had these ocean properties , yeah , really good .
They were mimics and transported to the planet Pandora , and for me , it was more of a principled way of doing my job .
The actual process that changed as a result .
So what can we conclude from all of this ? What lessons do we have ?
We learned . I think first of all .
Is curiosity ? It &apos;s the most powerful human property .
Our imagination is a force that even creates a reality .
Can and the respect of your team is .
More important than all the laurels of this world to me .
Come on young filmmakers who say , &quot; Give me a gift . &quot;
A advice on how I can do this .
And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t limit you . &quot;
Even one , that &apos;s already worried .
Others , for you , don &apos;t do it .
Bet yourself at bet .
Not against yourself .
Bring yourself .
Risk .
On you .
NASA .
Has such a favorite sentence ?
Failure .
Is not an alternative .
But in art and exploration , failure must be an alternative .
Because there it guarantees a trust advance , not an important one .
Do innovation ?
It was ever approached without risk , you have to be ready to take such risks .
That &apos;s the idea .
I &apos;d like to give you the idea of failure . Failure is an alternative .
Fear is not a thank you .
If I want to bring you one thing closer today , it &apos;s that the whole data we consume is larger .
As the sum of your parts , and instead of thinking about overloading information .
I want you to think about that .
How can we use information to create patterns ?
And we see trends that are otherwise invisible .
We would have become something we see here .
Is a typical death chart ?
Well , by age , the program I &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
It &apos;s called Pivot .
And what I can do with Pivot is I can filter for a certain cause of death .
Can we say accidents , and immediately I see another cause ?
Patterns that emerge , because in the middle , here , people are most active .
And they &apos;re most frail over here , we can go one step further and then rearrange the data .
And see that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects .
But not for everyone , if we go on and sort by age , say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are even the main cause .
People should be worried about them , and people should be looking at who &apos;s going to go on research .
That &apos;s particularly true for men .
So you can see that the image of information and data in this way is very much swimming .
In a vivid information graph , and if we can do this for raw data , why not content itself ?
So what we have here is the cover images of each individual .
Sports Illustrated , which have ever been printed .
It &apos;s all here , it &apos;s all online .
You can like to test it after I &apos;ve been talking in your rooms .
With Pivot , you can dive in .
In a decade , you can dive in a given year , you can jump directly to a particular issue .
So if I look here , I see the athletes who are appearing in this issue .
And the sports , I &apos;m a lance .
Armstrong .
Fan : So I click here .
What all the issues that Lance Armstrong is mentioned to me are showing up .
Now , if I get a bigger overview .
I want to think , OK ?
What if I was going to do everything about cycling ?
So I &apos;m going to take a step back .
And I &apos;m going to expand the perspective .
Now I &apos;m going to see Greg Lemon , and that &apos;s how you get an idea .
That if you look through this kind of information , you zoom in more targeted , wider , zoom out , you don &apos;t look .
Or you don &apos;t surf .
Just you .
Do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
It &apos;s something in between .
And we think it changes the way information is used .
Can I now take this idea a little bit further ?
With about something a little crazy .
What we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wikipedia page and reduced it to a little summary .
The summary contains a short overview .
And a symbol of the range .
This one , it comes from . I &apos;ll just show you the top 500 of the most popular ones .
Wikipedia pages , but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
Immediately , we get an idea of the issues .
The ones that are most popular on Wikipedia , I &apos;m going to vote on the issue of government .
Now , after I &apos;ve elected government , I realize that the categories of Wikipedia that are most likely to cover it .
Time Magazines : People of the Year .
Is this really important ?
Because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single Wikipedia page .
It &apos;s only to be seen .
If you go back a step and look at the whole thing , looking at one of these summaries .
Can I then go into the subject of Time ?
Magazines , &quot; People of the Year &quot; and see everybody together ? Now , when I look at all these people , I realize that the majority of them are government officials .
Some of them come from science .
Some of them come from economics , even less .
Here &apos;s my boss .
And one of them comes from music , and interestingly , Bono .
There &apos;s also a TED Prize .
Winners : So we can jump now and take a look at all of the TED Prize .
Winners throw , you see , we surf .
On the net , the first time it &apos;s really a net .
Not only side by side , but much more abstract .
And so I want to show you something else .
Which might be a little surprise . I &apos;m showing you .
Just the New York .
Times &apos; website Pivot : This application . I don &apos;t want to call it a browser .
It &apos;s really not a browser .
But you can look at websites with it .
And we bring this zoom technology to every single website .
Like this , so I can take a step back .
And jump directly to a specific section , which is important because you can only look at websites of this kind .
All the web history can be looked at in the same way .
So I can zoom in into my course in a certain time frame , and here &apos;s the state of play .
The whole demonstration that I &apos;ve been holding up to this point , and I can sort of look at everything I &apos;ve been looking at today .
I can get back .
And when I go out and look at everything , I can .
I can rearrange my course .
Maybe after my search past here , I &apos;ve been looking for nepotistic .
Here &apos;s Bing , or here &apos;s live Labs Pivot , and from here I can go into the page .
And call it again .
It &apos;s a metaphor .
It &apos;s used over and over again , and every time it does that .
Overall picture bigger .
As the sum of the data pieces that are currently thinking in this world .
We think data is a curse .
We talk about the curse of the abundance of information , we talk about drowning in information .
What if we could turn this situation around ?
And turn the Internet upside down so that instead of always moving from one to the other , we start .
From many things to many things .
To be able to see patterns that would otherwise have been hidden .
If we can do this , this hitherto data trap may become a new source of meaning .
Information , and not just information .
To move around , we can get knowledge from it .
And if we know , then maybe we can even learn wisdom from it .
So I stop . Thank you very much .
Everybody talks about happiness today .
I have some people counting the number of books .
Let those with happiness published in the title in the last five years .
And they stopped after about 40 , and there were many more .
There &apos;s a huge wave of interest .
Happiness among researchers . There &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching . Everybody would like to make people happier .
But despite all this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps .
They make it almost impossible to think clearly about happiness , and my talk today will be .
These cognitive traps are mainly about these .
This is true for laymen who think about their own happiness .
And it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness because it turns out we &apos;re just as confused .
Like everybody else , the first of these traps is a reluctance to complexity .
It turns out the word happiness is simply no longer a useful word .
Because we apply it to too many different things .
I think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we limit it to .
But by and large , this is something that we give up .
We need to get up and we will take the complicated view .
Do we need to take what well @-@ being is ?
The second case is a confusion of experience .
And memory , basically , is between happiness .
In his life and being happy about his life or being happy .
With his life , and these are two very different concepts .
And they &apos;re both thrown together .
In the notion of happiness , and the third is the concentration illusion .
And that &apos;s the unfortunate fact .
We can &apos;t think about one thing .
Well @-@ being affects without its meaning .
To distort , I mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive trap .
There &apos;s just no way .
It &apos;s right .
To get there , well , I &apos;d like to start with an example .
Someone who had a question and answer session , after one of my lectures , who reported a story , was unclear , he said he &apos;d heard a symphony .
And it was absolutely magnificent .
( Music ) And at the very end of the recording , there was a terrible one .
( Creating sound ) And then he added , &quot;
Really ?
Pretty emotional . &quot;
That &apos;s all the experience .
Ruined , but it didn &apos;t .
What it ruined was the memories of the experience .
It had the experience .
It had 20 minutes more glorious .
( Music )
It didn &apos;t count .
Because it had remained with a memory .
The memory was ruined .
And the memory was everything that he got to keep .
Did what that really tells us ?
Is that we &apos;re thinking about ourselves and about other people ?
Could it be in the sense of two kinds of self ? There &apos;s a living self that lives in the present .
And the present knows is capable of experiencing the past again .
But basically , only the present .
Is it the living self ?
That the doctor is acclaimed by , you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Is it doing it now ? &quot;
&quot; Woe if I touch you here , and then there &apos;s a remembering self . &quot;
And the remembering self is that which is mitzählt .
And keeps the story of our lives upright , and it &apos;s the one the doctor is addressing .
By asking the question , &quot; How did you feel lately ? &quot;
Or &quot; How was your journey ? &quot;
&quot; To Albania or something like that ? &quot;
Similar .
These are two very different units .
The living self and the remembering self and the two to be confused are part of the unity .
The concept of happiness .
Now , the remembering self .
Is a storyteller ?
And that really starts with a fundamental reaction .
It starts immediately on our memories .
We &apos;re not just telling stories when we get to it .
Telling stories , telling our memory .
Tales tell us stories .
That means what we can keep from our experiences is a story .
And let &apos;s just start with an example .
There &apos;s an old study . These are real patients undergoing a painful procedure . I &apos;m not going to go into detail .
It &apos;s no longer painful today .
But it was painful .
When this study was done in the 1990s , they were asked to report every 60 seconds about their pain .
And here are two patients .
These are their records .
And they &apos;re asked , &quot; Who of both suffered more ? &quot;
And that &apos;s a very simple question .
Patient B has clearly suffered more .
His intestinal reflection was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had A .
Patient B and more , but now there &apos;s another question .
How much did these patients think ?
They suffered , and here &apos;s a surprise .
And the surprise is that patient A has had a much worse reminder of intestinal reflection .
When patient B had the stories of intestinal reflections , different , and because a very critical part of the story is .
How it ends , and none of these stories is very edible .
Or great , but one of them is clear , but one of them is clear .
Worse than the other , and worse than the other , was where the pain was at its peak at the very end .
It &apos;s a bad story .
How do we know that ?
Because we asked these people about their gut reflection .
And much later .
How bad was the whole thing ?
Overall , and it was much worse .
For A , as for B , in memory . Well , this is a direct conflict .
Between the living self and the remembering self , from the perspective of the living .
Even B clearly had a worse time .
Now , what you could do with patient A , and we actually did clinical experiments .
And it &apos;s done .
It &apos;s been done .
And it works .
You could actually extend the intestinal reflection of patient A by just leaving the tube in there .
Without too much shake at it , that will lead to that .
The patient &apos;s suffering , but only a little bit less than before .
And if you do that for a few minutes , you &apos;ve done it .
That the living person himself is worse off by patient A.
And you &apos;ve made the memory self of patient A. much better off .
Because now you have patient A. A given a better story about his experience .
What does a story look like ?
And that &apos;s true of the stories .
The memory that gives us , and it &apos;s true of the stories .
The stories that we invent , which make a story unique .
Are upheavals ?
Significant moments and ends .
Ends .
Very , very important .
And in this case , the end dominated , well , the living self lives .
Its life continuous , it has moments of experience .
One after the other , and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
And the answer is really simple .
They &apos;re lost forever .
I mean , most moments of our lives , and I &apos;ve calculated this . You know , the psychological presence .
It &apos;s about three seconds .
Long , what does it mean ? Do you know , there are about 600 million of them in a life ?
In a month , there are about 600,000 , most of them left behind .
No trace , most of them .
They &apos;re completely ignored .
They &apos;re completely ignored by the memory self , and yet they kind of get the impression .
They should count .
That what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
It &apos;s the limited resource we use .
While we &apos;re in this world and how we consume it .
Would it seem important ?
But that &apos;s not the story .
So the memory self keeps us in , so we have the memory .
Even the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
The biggest difference between them is the way we deal with time .
From the perspective of the living self .
If you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good .
If it &apos;s like the first , then the two @-@ week one is .
Holiday twice as good as the one @-@ week one .
Holiday , that &apos;s how it works .
Not at all .
For the memory self , for the memory self , a two @-@ week holiday is .
Hardly better than the one @-@ week holiday , because there are no new memories added .
You haven &apos;t changed the story .
And in this way , time is actually the critical variable .
The memory self is different from a living self , time .
It has very little influence .
Now , on this story , the memory self , it makes more than remembering .
And telling stories , it &apos;s actually the one .
It makes decisions , because if you have a patient who , let &apos;s say , has two intestinal reflections with two different surgeons .
Had and decides which one to choose .
Should that be the one who chooses ?
The one who has the memory that &apos;s less bad .
And that &apos;s the surgeon who &apos;s chosen .
Will the living self have ?
No voice .
In this election , actually , we don &apos;t vote .
Between experiences , we choose between memories of experiences .
And even when we think about the future , we think about our future .
Normally not as experiences , we think about our future .
After , as anticipated memories , and basically , you can look at that .
You know , as a tyranny of the memory self , and you can think of the memory self .
As one , the living self , so to speak .
Traps through experience .
The living self .
Not necessary . I have the impression that when we go on vacation , it &apos;s very often the case , that is , .
We go on vacation as far as possible .
In the service of the memory self , and that &apos;s a little hard .
To justify , I think , how much do we feed from our memories ?
That &apos;s one of the explanations given for the dominance of the memory self .
And when I think about that , I think about a vacation we spent a few years ago in Antarctica .
It was clearly the best vacation I &apos;ve ever had .
And I think relatively often about how often I think of other vacations , and I probably have my memories of those three @-@ week trips .
I would say , for about 25 minutes .
In the last four years , I &apos;ve been driving , well , if I &apos;d ever opened the folder with the 600 images in it , I &apos;d spent another hour . Well , that &apos;s three weeks .
And that &apos;s at most one and a half hours , it seems .
There &apos;s disagreement . Well , I like to be a little extreme .
You know , in that , how little appetite I have for feeding ?
But of memories , even if you do more of that , there &apos;s a real question .
Why do we give memories ?
So much weight in the lurch .
So to the weight we give experiences , so I want you to think about a thought experiment .
Imagine your next vacation , you know , at the end of your vacation , all your images are destroyed .
And you get an amnesty drug , so you don &apos;t remember anything .
Now , you would choose the same vacation .
And if you chose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict .
Between your two kinds of self , and you have to think about it .
How you decide this conflict , and that &apos;s really even .
Not obvious , because if you think about time , you get an answer .
And if you think about memories , you could get a different answer .
Why ?
We choose vacations .
The one we choose is a problem .
The one that confronts us is a choice between the two species .
The self , well , the two kinds of self , throw two terms .
From happiness , there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply .
One per self , so you can ask , how happy is this living person ?
Even then , you would ask , how happy are the moments in life ?
The living self , and you &apos;re all happiness .
For moments , it &apos;s a pretty complicated one .
Process : What are the emotions ?
Which can be measured .
And by the way , we &apos;re now able to have a pretty good idea .
From the happiness of the living self over time , when you &apos;re asking about the happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
This is not about it .
How happy a person lives it .
Is it about how satisfied or happy ?
The person is very different in terms of their lives , when this person thinks about their lives , every person who doesn &apos;t distinguish these terms .
Will research into happiness melt up ?
And I &apos;m a lot of researchers about well @-@ being .
Who long masks research into happiness .
In this very way , did the distinction between happiness of the living self and happiness of the remembering self ?
Has been recognized in recent years , and now you &apos;re trying to separate the two .
To measure , the Gallup Organization has a global survey , in which more than half a million people .
Questions asked .
Have they been asked ?
Have they been asked about what they are about their lives ?
Think about their experiences ?
And there have been other efforts in the direction that have been made in recent years .
So we &apos;ve started to learn about the happiness of the two kinds of self .
And the main lesson that I think we &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
You can know how satisfied someone is with their lives .
And that really teaches you .
Not much about it .
How happy he is .
Life lives , and vice versa .
Just to give you an idea of correlation .
Correlation is about five percent , which means that .
Is that if you met someone , and you would tell them , &quot; Oh , his father is a two @-@ meter man , how much would you know about his size ? &quot;
Well , you would know something about his size .
But there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
You have so much uncertainty .
When I tell you that someone has his life as eight on a scale of 10 .
You have a lot of uncertainty .
How happy he is .
With his own living self .
So the correlation is low .
We know something about it .
What determines happiness itself , we know money is very important .
Targets are very important .
We know happiness is mostly about happiness .
Satisfied .
Being with people we like to spend time with people we like , there &apos;s other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant , so if you &apos;re lucky about the two kinds of self , you maximize happiness .
If you want to do these very different things in the end .
So the conclusion from what I &apos;ve said here is that we really shouldn &apos;t imagine happiness .
As a substitute for well @-@ being , it &apos;s a completely different term .
Now , very briefly , another reason why we don &apos;t think about happiness very clearly .
Can &apos;t we pay attention to the same things ?
When we think about life , and when we actually live , when you ask the simple question of how happy people in California are .
Are they not going to be the correct answer ?
Are they going to get the right answer when they ask that question ?
Do they think that people in California need to be happier ?
When they say , &quot; We live in Ohio and what happened ? &quot;
That when they think about life in California , they think about the difference .
Between California and other places , and that difference is , say , in the climate .
Well , it turns out climate doesn &apos;t matter very much to the living self .
And it &apos;s not even very important .
For the thoughtful self , that decides how happy people are , but now , because the thoughtful self is responsible .
Can you end up with some people ?
Can you end up moving to California , and it &apos;s kind of interesting .
Tracking what happens to people .
They move to California hoping to get happier .
Now , their living self won &apos;t get happier .
We know that , but one thing will happen .
You &apos;ll think you &apos;re happier .
Because if you think about it , you &apos;re reminded of it .
How terrible the weather in Ohio was .
And you &apos;ll feel you made the right decision .
It &apos;s very difficult to think clearly about well @-@ being .
And I hope I &apos;ve given you an idea of that .
How difficult it is . Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
I have a question .
Thank you very much .
Well , when we telephoned a few weeks ago , you told me that there was a pretty interesting result .
This came from this Gallup survey , is that something you &apos;re participating in ?
Because you can leave a few minutes now .
Daniel Kahneman :
Certainly .
I think the most interesting result .
The one we found in the Gallup survey .
It &apos;s a number that we absolutely cannot find .
We expected it to be in terms of happiness for the survivor , even if we looked at how feelings vary with income , and it turns out that under an income of 60,000 dollars in a year , for Americans .
And that &apos;s a very big sample .
Of Americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample .
Under an income of 600,000 dollars a year , about 60,000 .
DK : 60,000 , 60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy .
And they &apos;re getting increasingly unhappy .
The poorer they get , we get an absolutely flat line about it .
I mean , I rarely have such flat lines .
See what happens ?
Is it obvious that money doesn &apos;t raise happiness from an experience , but that lack of money certainly creates misery , and we can measure this misery very , very clearly ?
In the sense of the other , even the remembering self , you get a different story .
The more money you make , the more satisfied you are .
Isn &apos;t it for emotions ?
CA : But Danny : Throughout the American endeavor , it &apos;s about life .
Freedom , the aspiration for happiness .
If people were to take this finding seriously , I mean , it seems to be all on the head .
To put everything we believe , for example , in terms of tax policy and so on .
Is there a chance that politicians , that the country in general , would take a finding like that seriously ?
And based on that , politics would do DK , you know , I think there &apos;s recognition .
For the role of gambling research in politics , recognition will be .
Slowly , in the United States , no question , but in the United Kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now .
And in other countries , it &apos;s happening .
People are recognizing it .
You should think about happiness .
If you think about politics , it &apos;s going to take a while .
And people will discuss whether they want to explore experiential happiness .
Or whether they want to explore life assessment .
So we need to have this discussion pretty soon .
How to increase happiness is very different .
Depending on how you think and whether you think about the memory self .
Or whether you think about the living self .
That will affect politics .
I think in the coming years , in the United States , you &apos;re tightening on the experience happiness of the population .
Measuring that , I think , in the next one or two decades , will be part of the national statistics .
His CA : Well , it seems to me that this topic is going to , or should at least be , the most interesting political debate to follow .
Over the next few years , thank you very much .
For the invention of behavioral economics , thank you , Danny Kahneman . Today I &apos;m going to talk to you .
Energy and climate , and that might surprise you a little bit , because my full @-@ time work at the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds .
It &apos;s about the things that we need to invent and deliver .
It &apos;s about enabling the poorest two billion to live better .
But energy and climate are extremely important .
In fact , for these people , they &apos;re even more important than anyone .
For others on the planet , climate degradation means that their seeds will not grow for many years .
It means we &apos;re raining too much or too little .
Things will change that way .
Like their fragile environment .
Not sustainable .
Can that lead ?
To starvation , it leads to insecurity .
It leads to unrest .
So climate change is getting terrible .
For them , too , the energy price is for them .
Very important .
The fact is , if you could just reduce the price of one thing , you would be to reduce poverty .
Energy by far the most effective . Well , the energy price has fallen over time .
In fact , the progress society is based on energy advances that drove coalmining evolution .
The industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid fall in the electricity price , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators .
Air conditioning : We can make modern materials .
And so many things we do , so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation .
With electricity in the rich world , but if we reduce the price , we let the price halve .
Let &apos;s hit a new barrier , and this barrier is related to CO2 .
CO2 warms the planet , and the equation for CO2 is actually pretty clear .
They sum up the CO2 emitted .
Which one to increase temperature ?
And this increase in temperature has some very negative consequences .
Effects on the weather .
And perhaps worse , the indirect consequence is that natural ecosystems don &apos;t adapt to such rapid changes .
Can whole systems collapse , and so on ?
Well , the exact link between a CO2 increase and the resulting temperature change , and where its further consequences lie .
There are some ambiguities .
But not very many .
And there &apos;s certainly uncertainty about how bad these consequences will be .
But they will be extremely bad .
I &apos;ve asked the top scientists several times , &quot; Do we really have to get down to near zero ? &quot;
&quot; Not enough . &quot;
Half or a quarter . &quot; The answer is until we get near zero .
Will the temperature keep going ?
Will it rise ?
So it &apos;s a big challenge .
It &apos;s quite different .
When we say we have a 3.5 @-@ meter truck .
It &apos;s under a three @-@ meter bridge .
You have to get there , you can sort of get below that .
You squeeze it down to zero . Now , we hit zero every year .
A lot of carbon dioxide .
Over 26 billion tons of every American , about 20 tons .
People from poor countries , less than one on average , it &apos;s about five tons .
For everyone on the planet , and somehow we have to make changes .
They reduce that to zero , it &apos;s constant so far .
Just different economic ones have increased .
Changes have affected it at all .
And we have to go from rapid growth to reduction .
And to a reduction to zero , this equation has .
Four factors : A little multiplication .
You have this thing on the left , CO2 .
You want to get it to zero , and that will depend on the number of people .
The services that every human being uses on average .
The average energy for every service , and the CO2 emitted per unit of energy .
So let &apos;s take every factor individually .
Let &apos;s look at and think about how we get it to zero .
One of these numbers probably has to get very close to zero .
Now , this is basic algebra .
But let &apos;s go through it .
First of all , we have the population living today .
6.8 billion people , and it &apos;s going to go to 9 billion .
Moving to 9 billion if we succeed very successfully with new vaccines , healthcare and reproductive medicine , we might well be 10 to 15 percent lower that .
But right now we see a 1.3 percent rise , the second factor .
Are the services we use ? That includes all the food we eat .
Clothing , television , heating . These are very good things .
And poverty reduction means these services to almost everyone on the planet .
Making them accessible . It &apos;s great .
That this number is rising in the rich world , in the top billion .
Could we possibly make cuts ?
And use less , but on average , this number is going to rise every year .
And so overall , more than double the number of services that are provided per person .
Here we see a very basic service .
Is there at home ?
Light to read the homework .
Can &apos;t , and these students don &apos;t ?
So they go out and read their homework .
Under the street light , now , effectiveness , which is the energy per service .
It &apos;s good news at last .
We have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
Because of different successes in the lighting sector , because of other types of cars , because of new methods .
In the building of houses , there are many services that you can drastically reduce their energy consumption .
Can you drastically reduce that ?
Can you ?

Is the scope for improvement ?
Very much smaller .
Overall , if we are optimistic , we may be going to get a reduction .
By a factor of three , or maybe even a factor of six .
But in the first three , we are now from 26 billion to perhaps the very best .
13 billion tons have gone .
And that &apos;s just enough .
So we don &apos;t look at the fourth factor .
And this will be a key factor .
That &apos;s the amount of CO2 .
It &apos;s emitted per unit of energy . It &apos;s going to be .
The question is , can you get that to zero ?
If you burn coal ? No , if you burn natural gas ? No .
Almost every method of making electricity .
Today , CO2 emits , except renewable energy and nuclear energy , so what we do on a global scale .
Must we create a new system ?
We need energy under , if I use the term &quot; miracle . &quot;
I don &apos;t mean the impossible , the microprocessor .
Is a miracle ?
The PC is a miracle .
The Internet and its services are a miracle that people here have .
And to the development of many of these miracles , usually there is no deadline .
That you need a miracle by a certain date .
Normally , you &apos;re just standing beside it .
And some don &apos;t come .
But in this case , we have to give full gas .
And a miracle in a very short time .
Get . Well , I wondered , how can I really get this over ?
Is there a natural illustration , a demonstration ?
Which sparks the idea of people here . I remembered last year .
When I brought mosquitos , and somehow people liked that , which became the idea .
Really tangible to them , you know , there are people .
They who live with mosquitos for energy fell .
I did this . I decided that releasing fireflies , my contribution this year to the environment , was here .
So , would there be some natural fireflies ?
I was assured they &apos;re not biting . Actually , they &apos;re not even going to leave the glass .
Well , there are all kinds of game solutions like this , but they &apos;re not bringing much . We .
Do you need solutions , either one or more , that make an unimaginable scale ?
And unimaginable reliability , and though there are many directions where people are looking for it .
I really see only five that make these big demands .
Can I have tides ?
Geothermal fusion .
And biofuels omitted .
These may make a moderate contribution , and if they do better than I expect , that would be great .
But my key message here is that we need to work on all those five .
And we can &apos;t give up any of them .
Because they intimidate us , because everybody has significant problems .
Let &apos;s first look at burning fossil fuels .
Burning fuels .
From either coal or natural gas , what you have to do there seems to be .
Maybe just .
But that &apos;s it .
Not you have to have all that CO2 .
That comes out of the chimney after burning .
Liquid under pressure and then store somewhere .
And hope it stays there .
There are some pilot projects that can do that at a 60 / 80 level .
But get it to 100 .
It &apos;s going to be very difficult .
And an agreement on storing CO2 is a big challenge .
But the biggest problem here is the question of storage time . Who &apos;s going to do it ?
Ensure .
Who can guarantee something ?
What literally is many billion times bigger .
As any kind of waste you get to imagine about nuclear and other things .
Can that be a lot of volume ? So that &apos;s a hard nut .
Next , nuclear energy . It also has three big ones .
Problems : The cost , especially in highly regulated countries , is high .
The question of security is that you really feel that nothing goes wrong .
Despite human cooperation , can the fuel not be used for weapons ?
And what do you do then ?
With the waste , because although it &apos;s not very big .
Are there a lot of concerns ?
People need to feel good about it .
184,00 10 20 000 GT 00 10 25 000 , which is three very difficult ones .
So problems that are perhaps solvable , three very difficult problems .
They may be solvable , and they should work on them .
So I summarized the last three of the five of them : Renewable energy .
As you &apos;re often called , and they have , even though it &apos;s great .
They don &apos;t need fuel .
They have some disadvantages .
One is the energy density that these technologies generate .
Dramatically lower than the power plants , these are low @-@ energy — you talk about many square kilometers , thousands of times .
More space than a normal power plant .
And also , these sources are subject to interruptions .
The sun doesn &apos;t shine all day long , it doesn &apos;t shine every day , and the wind blows the same way .
Not all the time .
So if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , you have to have a way to have the energy even in times when it &apos;s not available .
So there are big price challenges here , there are transmission challenges , for example , when we say that the energy source is outside the country .
Don &apos;t you need it ?
Just technology .
You also need to deal with the risk .
That the energy comes from where else , and there &apos;s the storage problem and the dimension .
To show you , I &apos;ve got all kinds of batteries that are made .
Look at the cars , computers .
Mobile phones , flashlights for everything .
And I &apos;ve got that with the amount of electronic energy that the world uses , compared to what I found .
It turns out all the batteries that we &apos;re now producing .
We could store less than 10 minutes of total energy , so we need a big breakthrough here .
Something that will be 100 percent better by one factor .
So when the approaches are going on right now , that &apos;s not impossible .
But it &apos;s not that easy .
That &apos;s what happens when you try to get these interrupted sources to , say , 20 @-@ 30 percent of consumption .
If you want to rely on that 100 percent , you need an incredible wonder battery .
Now , where are we going to go ?
What &apos;s the right approach ?
A Manhattan project : How do we get to the finish ?
What we need is a lot of companies working on it , hundreds of people in each of these five areas .
We have at least 100 people , many of whom will say they &apos;re crazy .
That &apos;s good .
I think there are many in the TED group who are already engaged there .
Bill Gross has several companies , including one called Esolar , which has great solar thermal technologies .
Vinod Khosla is investing .
Dozens of companies doing great things and have interesting opportunities .
And I &apos;m trying to support that .
Nathan Myhrvold and I are funding a company .
Maybe surprisingly , it &apos;s pursuing the nuclear approach , there are some innovations in the nuclear field modular .
Liquid , the development stopped in this industry a while ago .
So it &apos;s not a big surprise .
Some good concepts lie around , which means the Terrapower concept .
That instead of a part of the uranium , one percent , the U235 , we decided to burn the 99 .
The U238 is a pretty crazy one .
Idea , but actually , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time .
But you could never simulate it sensibly .
Whether it would work , but since there are modern supercomputers , you can simulate it .
And you can see that , with the right approach to matter , it looks like this .
It works , and because you burn these 99 , the cost profile is much better .
In fact , you burn the garbage , and you can even use the garbage of today &apos;s reactors as a drive .
Instead of breaking your head over it , they just burn it .
A great thing : Uranium is gradually becoming .
It consumes a little bit like a candle .
You can see that it &apos;s a kind of column .
It &apos;s often called a migratory wave reactor , which really solves the fuel problem . Here &apos;s a picture of a place in Kentucky .
That &apos;s the waste .
The 99 , you &apos;ve burned the part of the one that &apos;s burned today .
It &apos;s taken out , so it &apos;s called &quot; depleted uranium . &quot;
That &apos;s what drives the U.S. for hundreds of years .
And if you filter ocean water cheaply and easily , you get enough fuel for the rest .
Life of the planet , you know , there are many challenges there , but it &apos;s an example .
Of many hundreds of concepts that we need .
To move forward , we &apos;re thinking about how to measure our success .
Should our testimony look like ?
Well , we go to the goal that we need to achieve .
And then we talk about the intermediate step .
Many talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 . It &apos;s really , really important .
That we get there . The remaining 20 percent is produced in poor countries .
Are there still some agriculture ?
Hopefully , forest threats and cement will happen by then .
Be clean , so to get to that 80 percent .
Do the developed world , including countries like China , have to completely transform their generation of electricity ?
The other note says whether we &apos;re using zero emissions technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries .
And we &apos;re on the way to the rest .
Getting that is great .
Important . That &apos;s going to be a key element of this certificate .
If we go back from there , what should that 2020 be ?
It should contain the two elements again .
We should use the effectiveness measures to get reduction going .
The less we emit , the lower the carbon sum will be .
And so the temperature , but actually , this note is for the things we do , which are not completely leading to the big reductions .
Just equal , right ?
Even something .
Less important .
Like the other .
Which one ? Speed ?
Innovation .
For these breakthroughs .
Is this breakthroughs ?
Do we have to track with full gas ?
And we can measure that .
In company numbers , in pilot projects and regulatory changes , there are lots of great books .
On this subject , Al Gore &apos;s book , we have the choice , and David McKay &apos;s Sustainable .
Energy without the Hot Air , you really do .
You go through and create a framework .
In which this can be widely discussed , because we need support for it .
From all sides , there &apos;s a lot that comes together .
Does that need to be a wish ?
A very concrete one .
Wish that we invent this technology if you just want me to have one wish for the next 50 years .
I could choose the president , a vaccine , and I love that .
Or I could choose that wish .
That &apos;s half the energy price .
Without CO2 , it &apos;s invented .
That &apos;s what I would like to see . This one has the greatest impact if we don &apos;t get that wish .
Will the gap between long @-@ term and short @-@ term thinking ?
People get terrible between the United States and China .
Between poor and rich countries , and almost all of them live on these two .
Billions will be much worse .
So what do we need to do ?
What measures do I appeal for ? We need to work for more research funding .
When countries meet in places like Koppenhagen , they should not just talk about CO2 .
They should discuss this innovation strategy .
And they would be shocked .
Of the ridiculously low money spent on these innovative approaches .
We need market incentives , carbon taxes .
CAP &amp; amp ; Trade : Something that sends out a price signal . We need to spread the message .
We need to have dialogue more rational and complete .
And the things that the government is doing , too , is an important wish , but I think we can fulfill it .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Just to make Terrapower a little better .
First of all , you can give us an idea of the scale of this investment .
Bill Gates : To do the simulation on a supercomputer , all the big scientists .
To get what we &apos;ve done , we just need a few 10 million , and even .
If we &apos;ve tested our materials in a Russian reactor to make sure it works properly .
Is it only in the 100s ?
Millions , the difficult step is building .
The first reactor : Finding billions more , the regulariums and the place that actually builds the first of them .
Once the first is finished , when it runs as promised .
Then it &apos;s all very clear .
Because the profitability , the energy density , is so different .
As with nuclear energy as we know it , CA : To understand that correctly .
That means building deep into the ground .
Almost like a vertical .
Pillar of nuclear fuel , that used .
Uran : And then the process begins .
Up there , and continues to work .
Down . BG : Exactly today , you have to refill the reactor .
So there are lots of people and lots of controls that go wrong .
Can this thing where you open it ?
And things in there ?
Or bring out ?
That &apos;s not good .
But if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years .
Think of a column that you bury .
Without all the complexities , and it sits there and burns .
For 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
CA : A nuclear reactor .
The self @-@ solution for the garbage . BG : Yeah . Well , what happens to the garbage ?
You can sit it .
There &apos;s much less garbage .
With this method , you take it and grab it .
In the next reactor , you burn it further .
And we start by taking the garbage .
It already exists , which is in these cooling basins or dry tanks at the reactors .
That &apos;s our starting fuel .
So what a problem was with these reactors .
What we do in our fill , and that &apos;s dramatically reducing the volume of garbage .
Reduced during this process , about , but while you talk to different people in the world about these possibilities .
Where is the biggest ?
Interest , this is really what .
Implementation .
BG : Well , we haven &apos;t yet set ourselves in a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting .
Disclosure rules for everything that &apos;s nuclear in the name , there &apos;s a lot of interest , and the people of the company were in Russia , India .
China : I was here and I met the energy minister .
And I talked about how this fits into the energy agenda .
I &apos;m optimistic .
You know , the French and the Japanese have made something in the direction .
This is a variant .
One thing that was done .
Was this an important step ?
Forward , but it &apos;s like a quick one .
Reactor and some countries have built this , so anyone who &apos;s implemented a quick reactor is .
Has a candidature for our first CA in your imagination , timeframe ?
And probability , really , this is what ?
To start with .
BG : Well , we need one of these scalable .
Power generating things that are very cheap .
We &apos;ve got 20 years to invent .
And then 20 years to start , which is kind of the deadline that environmental models have shown us .
We have to keep to that , and you know , Terrapower , if it &apos;s going well .
And that &apos;s a big wish .
Could that keep it easy ?
And fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds that work the same way when their approaches work .
The promotion for their pilots can work with them , and it would be best if they could do several , because then you could use a mix , definitely you need .
We need a solution .
CA : So , with regard to the big , possible breakthroughs , this is the biggest one .
You know , BG : An energy break is the most important one .
That &apos;s it .
It would have been without the environmental challenge .
But it &apos;s still power .
So much more important in the nuclear sector .
Are there other innovative companies ? You know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as they do ?
But there &apos;s the modular method . That &apos;s a different approach .
There &apos;s a liquid reactor type that seems a little bit difficult .
But maybe they say that about us , and so there are different , but the nice thing about it is that a uranium molecule has a million times as much energy .
Like a carbon molecule , let &apos;s say , and that &apos;s why , if you can deal with the problems , and they &apos;re mainly radiation .
The footprint and the cost is that .
So potential , the impact on the land .
And other things , almost .
In a league of its own , CA : If that doesn &apos;t work , what do we have to do ?
To try to keep the Earth temperature stable . BG : When you get into this situation , it &apos;s as if you ate too much .
And you &apos;re about to have a heart attack , what do you do ?
You might need a heart surgery or something like that .
There &apos;s a research that &apos;s called geoengineering .
It &apos;s about different techniques to delay warming .
So that we could get 20 or 30 years longer to get together , which is just an insurance method .
You hope we don &apos;t need that .
Some people say you shouldn &apos;t work on insurance at all .
Because maybe you &apos;re lazy .
You eat on , because you know that the heart surgery will save you .
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart .
If you look at the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering .
Whether you have that at your disposal .
Should things get faster ?
Or this innovation ?
It takes longer than we expect . About climate skeptics have one or two sentences for them , perhaps to convince them .
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
Those who make scientific arguments are very little .
Tell them there are negative effects .
Those who deal with clouds have shifted things .
There are very , very few things they can even say .
Of which there is a chance in a million , the main problem here is so similar .
As with AIDS , you make the mistake .
Now , and you pay a lot for it .
Later , and that &apos;s why the idea is now , if you have all sorts of urgent problems .
Investing in something that you only have later , what you have , and that comes on top of that .
That the investment is not so clear .
In fact , the IPCC Report is not necessarily the worst scenario .
And there are people in the rich world .
They look at IPCC and say , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s not a big one .
Drama , the fact is that this uncertainty is worrying us .
But if my dream here is that if you can make it economically and at the same time eliminate CO2 , you can make it . &quot;
And then the skeptics say , &quot; Okay . &quot;
I &apos;m not interested .
It &apos;s not that it emits CO2 . I almost wish it did , but I &apos;m probably going to accept it .
Because it &apos;s cheaper .
So , as the previous method -- CA : And that would be your answer to Björn .
Lomborg &apos;s argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve the CO2 problem , you can do it .
All the other goals , including poverty reduction , malaria control and so on , are suffering .
That it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources .
Investing money for it while there are better things .
We can do that . BG : Well , the actual spending on research .
We , the U.S. , should spend 10 billion more a year .
When you do that today , that &apos;s not so dramatic .
It &apos;s not something that should suffer other things .
You get too much money .
And here , reasonable people can disagree .
If you have something that &apos;s not economic and you try to finance it .
For me , most waste is happening here .
Unless you &apos;re very short .
Before a breakthrough in cost , and you only fund the learning curve , I think we should try more things .
They have the potential , much cheaper .
If the swab you get is a very high energy price .
Then only the rich can keep up .
I mean , each of us here could spend five times as much on our energy .
Without changing our lifestyle for the lower two billion , but is it a disaster ?
And even Lomborg thinks , &quot; To make his new mesh , why is research not being discussed anymore ? &quot;
He &apos;s still being associated with the skeptic camp because of his earlier stories .
But he understood that this is a very lonely group .
And so he &apos;s now bringing the research argument , and that &apos;s a thought .
I think that &apos;s appropriate : Research . It &apos;s just crazy .
How little support is given to this . CA : Bill , I think I speak for almost all the people here .
When I say , &quot; I really hope that your wish will come true . &quot;
Thank you very much .
BG : Thank you .
I &apos;d like to tell you something .
What I did a few months ago when I wrote an article for Italian .
Wired noticed , I always got my synonymous dictionary ready for writing .
But I was working on the text .
I was done already , and I noticed that I &apos;ve never looked at my life .
What the word &quot; obstructs &quot; really means : I read you the entry &quot; obstructed &quot; .
Adjective : Curved , helpless , useless .
Destroyed .
Deceased .
Mutilated .

( See also injured )
@ useless
And @ weak
@ antonyme ( healthy , strong )
@ efficient
I read this list out loud to a friend .
And I had to laugh first .
It worked so ridiculous .
But I just got ready and couldn &apos;t speak any more and had to stop .
Read and collect me first .
After this assaulted flood of words and the emotional shock that it caused , of course .
This was a fractured old synonym dictionary . I just thought that the issue had to be pretty old .
But in fact , it was an issue in the early &apos; 80s .
When I just started primary school , and that started my self @-@ image .
Outside my family environment , I started building and shaping .
Also , with regard to other children and the rest of the world around me .
And thank God .
I didn &apos;t use a synonym dictionary at the time .
Would I take this entry seriously ?
Would I have been born into a world ?
Anyone like me would perceive it as a person whose lives are not in any way positive .
But can I now , for the opportunities and adventures I &apos;ve experienced ?
So I immediately called the 2009 online edition .
And I expected to find a more appealing contribution here .
The updated version of this entry , unfortunately , is not much .
Better , especially , the last two words shake me .
Under Near Anonyms , it &apos;s all healthy , but it &apos;s not just about the words , it &apos;s about what we think about people .
The words we describe with these words , it &apos;s about values .
The words that are in those words , and how we construct those values , affects our language .
Our thinking and how we influence the world and the people around us .
Many ancient societies , including Greeks and Romans , have .
Really believed .
That the debate of a curse has a great force .
Because what you say loud can manifest itself .
So what do we want ?
Actually manifest .
A disabled person .
People or a powerful person .
People alone , a human being .
To call it mindless as a child .
Could it be enough to limit it ?
And to impose ideas on you .
Would it not be more beautiful to you ?
Open doors .
A human being .
The one who opened doors for me was my pediatrician .
At the A.I. DuPont Institute in Wilmington , Delaware , he &apos;s called Dr. Pizzutillo , an Italo @-@ American whose name , you think , is .
Can most Americans not be correct ?
So he was always called Dr. P.
And Dr. P. always wore very colorful .
Flies and was for working with kids .
Simply made .
I found the time I spent in this hospital .
Simply great .
Except for my physiotherapy , I had to repeat individual exercises seemingly infinitely .
With these thick elastic bands in different colors , you know , to build my leg muscles .
And I hated these bands more .
As anything else , I hated them , I cursed them .
I hated them .
And imagine , I even had a child of five with Dr. P. negotiated .
And so this is how to stop these exercises .
Natural , without success .
And one day he watched me doing one of my exercises .
These exercises were just tiring .
And mercilessly , and he said to me , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you &apos;re such a powerful , powerful .
And young girl , you &apos;re going to tear one of these tapes one day , and if you can , I &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
That was , of course , just a simple trick .
From Dr. P. , to do the exercises that I don &apos;t do .
I wanted to do with the prospect that the richest five @-@ year @-@ old girl would be in the hospital on the second floor .
But he actually got me to look at my daily exercise horror with new eyes .
So it became a new and promising experience .
And I wonder today how much his vision of me is .
As a strong and powerful young girl , I shaped my self @-@ image , and I could imagine myself as one of nature &apos;s strong , powerful and atlethic people .
To see , this is just one example .
Of many , like adults in power positions .
Instigate a child &apos;s imagination , but like the examples already cited from the synonymous dictionaries , our language doesn &apos;t allow us to imagine anything .
What we all want would allow each and every one of us to do .
To see ourselves as powerful people , our language lags behind .
It &apos;s after social change .
It &apos;s because in many cases , technological change has triggered it , from a medical point of view .
You can say , of course , that my legs are laser surgery for visually impaired , knee joints made of titanium and artificial hip joints .
For aging bodies that allow people to really use all their possibilities .
And beyond the limits that their natural destiny sets them .
Have to develop .
Not to speak at all .
Social networking platforms : People allow themselves to give their own identity .
Define themselves in their own way , and thus orient themselves globally to groups .
So maybe choosing them for themselves illustrates this technological change .
More clearly than ever , there has always been a different truth , which is that every human being has something very special and very powerful in society .
And that human ability to adapt is our greatest plus .
Human ability to adapt is an interesting story .
Because people keep asking me to tell .
How I deal with adversity , and I &apos;ll confess something to you , this sentence has .
Never fit for me , and I &apos;ve always been very uncomfortable .
So I felt like answering people &apos;s questions .
And I think gradually I understand why .
This sentence about dealing with adversity .
Lives to the idea that success or happiness depends on it .
Tackling a challenge .
Without being shaped by the experience that it entails .
As if my life had been so successful because I could have traps of a life with a prosthesis .
Could or whatever people perceive me with my disability ?
But the truth is that we are changing , of course .
We are shaped by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physical , emotional or even both .
And I &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
Adversity is not an obstacle .
We need to curve to make our lives better understood .
Adversity is just part of it .
Our life , and I tend to be adversity as my shadow .
See , sometimes I realize it &apos;s very present .
Sometimes it &apos;s hard to see .
But it &apos;s always with me .
And I don &apos;t want to mean by any means to reduce the impact or severity of a human struggle .
There are adversity and challenges in life , and they &apos;re all too common .
Real , and every person goes with it .
Different , but the question is not whether we can get clear with adversity or not .
But how we get clear with it , so we &apos;re not just responsible for it .
The people we love to keep from blows of fate .
But also to prepare them for it , good for it , clear for it .
And we do our kids .
No favours if we give them the feeling that they don &apos;t adapt .
Can you ? You have to separate two things clearly .
One is the medical fact that you &apos;re amputee , and the other is the social opinion about whether I &apos;m disabled .
Or not .
And to be honest , the only real and lasting disability I deal with .
It &apos;s that the world has to be constantly saying .
It can describe me with these definitions .
In our desire to protect the people that care about us .
And to tell you the cold , hard truth about your medical prognosis .
Or even a prognosis about quality of life .
To put the one that expects you , we have to be careful not to lay the foundation for someone actually being disabled .
Maybe the current concept is .
It &apos;s just about what &apos;s broken .
And how we fix that for each individual , a greater disability than pathology .
In itself , if we don &apos;t treat a person holistically and not all of his forces .
And perceive and recognize opportunities .
In addition to the natural struggle , let &apos;s create .
You may need to lead another disease , we degrade .
A person who has value for our society , so we need to look beyond patology .
And focus on all areas of human potential , most importantly , it &apos;s that there &apos;s a gap between perception of our inadequacies and our great inventive spirit .
We should have these challenging times .
Not depreciation .
Or deny .
We should not try to avoid them .
We should not sweep them under the carpet .
It &apos;s about opportunities in adversity .
To recognize , it &apos;s perhaps more about making it clear to me .
That we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome adversity .
It &apos;s that we are open to it .
It &apos;s embrace .
It &apos;s embrace .
It &apos;s grab it in the head . To use a fight expression , and maybe even dance with it .
And maybe we can do it .
It &apos;s to see adversity as something natural , coherent and useful .
And it &apos;s to make us feel like this .
It &apos;s not your presence .
It &apos;s more burdened .
This year we celebrate the 200th .
Charles &apos; birthday .
Darwin : And when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , Darwin , in my eyes , has something very true in human character .
I would rewrite it like this : &quot; Not the strongest of its kind survives . &quot;
And neither does it .
The smartest of its kind , but the one that best adapts to change .
Can conflict arise ?
Creativity , not .
Only from Darwin &apos;s work do we know that the human capacity to survive and flourish from the struggle of the human mind .
Conflicts are destined to change .
So again , change and adaptation are the greatest abilities .
Of man , and maybe we know only from what wood we are carved from .
If we &apos;re really tested , maybe that &apos;s the point .
Of adversity , of perception .
Of ego , of feeling for our own strength .
We can give ourselves something like that .
We can give adversity a new meaning .
That goes beyond difficult times , maybe we can see adversity as change .
Adversity stands for change .
We haven &apos;t adapted to that yet . I think the greatest damage we have done to ourselves .
It &apos;s believable .
It &apos;s that we should be normal .
Let &apos;s face it .
Who &apos;s normal ?
There &apos;s no normal .
There &apos;s the usual , the typical , but not the normal , and would you be that poor , gray person ?
Really ?
Want to know if they really existed ?
I don &apos;t think it would be great .
If we were to counter this pattern of normality to another of the possibilities or the strength .
In fact , to put it a little more dangerously , we could exchange it .
So we can unleash the forces of very many children .
And invite them to put their very special and valuable skills into society .
Anthropolgen has found out .
That we humans are always demanding one thing from the members of our society .
Being useful .
And contributing . There &apos;s evidence that even the Neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , older people and people with severe physical injuries , had worn with them .
And that might have happened because the life experience in these people &apos;s struggle for survival was valuable to society .
They didn &apos;t break these people as broken and useless .
They were seen as something special .
And valuable was treated a few years ago .
Did I go to the city ?
In the city where I grew up , I went to a food market in that Red Zone .
In the northeast of Pennsylvania , and I stood in front of a bushel .
Tomatoes .
It was summer , and I had shorts , and I hear a guy behind me .
Say , &quot; Well , if that &apos;s not Aimee Mullins , and I turn around and see this older man . &quot; I had no idea .
Who he is , and I said , &quot; Excuse me .
Sir , do we know ? &quot; I can &apos;t remember you , and he said , &quot; Well , you &apos;re unlikely to be .
Remember me when I first saw you . &quot;
Have I got you out ?
Your mother &apos;s belly .
Get it . Oh .
So , the , and of course , it did , but click .
This was Dr. Kean , a man .
I just told my mother about this day from stories .
Because , of course , I was typical of my birthday , two weeks late .
Did the doctor come for prenatal diagnosis of my mother was on vacation ?
And so my parents knew the man who gave me birth .
Not at all .
And because I was born without the legs of my calf and my feet were directed towards them .
And I had only a few toes .
On this one and a few toes at the other foot , he was the handler , this stranger had to bring the bad news .
He said to me , &quot; I had to tell your parents .
You would never walk .
And never be so mobile . &quot;
He would be like other kids , or you would never lead an independent life .
And since then , they &apos;ve just lied to me .
Really punished .
Exceptionally , I found that he collected newspaper clips of my entire childhood .
Whether I was winning a letter contest in second grade .
Whether I was traveling with the scouts on Halloween parade , whether I was on a scholarship or one of my sporting victories .
And he used these clips to teach his students .
Medical students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School , and he called this part of his course .
The X factor , the potential .
The human will . You just can &apos;t stress enough how critical this factor is .
It can be for a human being &apos;s quality of life , and Dr. Kean continued .
He said , &quot; I learned that if you don &apos;t get something else constantly , and even if you get a little bit of support , children will get a little bit of support .
If you leave kids to themselves , children can achieve a lot .
Look at Dr. Kean .
Has his thinking changed ?
He understood .
That medical diagnosis and how someone deals with it are two different things .
And I too have changed my thinking over time .
If you asked me at the age of 15 , if I had my prostheses exchanged for legs made of meat and bones .
Had I not hesitated for a second ?
I absolutely wanted to be normal at the time .
If you ask me that today , I &apos;m not so sure .
And that &apos;s what happened .
Because I &apos;ve experienced something with my legs .
And not despite these experiences , and maybe that change could happen .
Because I &apos;ve met so many people .
Am they opening doors to me ?
Have they not met people ?
Who want to restrict me or overtake me ? See , it needs .
Really ?
Only one person who demonstrates to you how to manifest their forces .
And they &apos;re through , if they allow someone to activate their own inner forces .
The human mind is so receptive .
If they can do that and for someone to open a door at a critical moment .
Then they &apos;re a very good teacher for these people .
They teach them to open doors to themselves .
The real meaning of the word educate is rooted in the word educe , which means producing something .
That in one is the potential to tickle out .
Again , what potential do we want to retrieve now ?
In the 1960s , a case study was conducted in the U.K.
Back then , high schools were transformed into schools .
They call that there .
Streaming trials in the U.S. We call that tracking . Students become .
Selected by grades , and the A students are being tested orally harder .
Get the better teachers , etc . , and they have a three @-@ month period .
Students with a sufficiently good grade .
They were told they were aces .
They were very smart .
And after those three months , they really wrote one .
And of course , it breaks your heart .
To hear that the other way around , the one @-@ serer students were told .
They were just enough .
And so it was after the three months .
But only those who were still in school .
Apart from the students who had thrown the school , it was very important .
In this study , the teachers were not inaugurated .
The teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
They were simply told that they were the ones , and that the students with the grade are sufficient and have the same .
They taught them something , and they treat the only real disability .
Is a broken mind ?
Is a spirit that &apos;s broken ?
Is there no hope ?
He &apos;s not finding anything .
Is it beautiful ?
He &apos;s missing our natural childlike .
Curiosity .
And our innate ability to imagination , but if we can do it , to support the human mind in doing it .
And to continue hoping for himself and other people around him .
To find beautiful .
To be curious and imaginative , then we put our forces in place .
Really ?
Positive : If a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new forms of existence .
I want to end with a poem .
This one by a Persian poet named Hafiz , written in the 14th century .
And it was told by my friend Jacques Dembois .
And the poem is called &quot; The God Who Knows Only Four Words . &quot;
Every child doesn &apos;t know God , the God .
The name doesn &apos;t .
The God of Prohibitions , but the God .
He knows only four words , and he repeats them all the time , he only says , &quot; Come dance . &quot;
&quot; With me , come dance . &quot;
With me , thank you very much .
