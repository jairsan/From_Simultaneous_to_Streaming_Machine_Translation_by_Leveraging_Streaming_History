A few years ago here at TED , Peter Skillman launched a design competition called &quot; The Marshmallow Challenge . 
&quot; The idea is pretty simple . Four teams have to have the widest possible freestanding structure with 20 spaghetti . CA : 1m tape . CA : 1m thread and build a marshmallow . 
The marshmallow has to be up there . 
And though it really seems simple , it &apos;s actually really hard . Because it &apos;s pushing people to work together very quickly . 
And so I thought this was an interesting idea . And I put it into a design workshop . 
It was a huge success . 
Since then , I &apos;ve been doing about 70 workshops around the world . With students , developers and architects , even CTOs , the Fortune 50 companies . And there &apos;s something about this task . What deep impressions into the nature of collaboration allow . And I want to share some of these with you . 
Normally , most people start themselves with the task of orienting themselves . 
They talk about it . They think about what it will look like . They &apos;re rangling for power . 
Then they invest a little time in planning and organization . They sketch and put spaghetti out . 
They invest a lot of their time in assembly . Constantly growing structures . 
And finally , Just before they have time , someone takes the Marshmallow . And they gently put it on the top , step . One step back and TA @-@ da . Admire your work . 
But then what happened almost always is that TA @-@ da becomes an UH @-@ Oh , because the weight of the marshmallow causes the whole thing to bend and collapse . 
There are a number of people who have a lot more UH @-@ Oh moments than others . And among the worst are freshest BWL graduates . 
They lie , they cheat . They &apos;re confused and they really produce poor shapes . 
And of course there are teams that have a lot more TA @-@ DA formations . And among the best are freshness graduates of the kindergarten . 
And that &apos;s quite amazing , like us . 
Peter told us , &quot; Don &apos;t just produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all . 
&quot; What you might be asking is , &quot; How does this come about ? &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; What about those ? 
&quot; And Peter doesn &apos;t tell one . The kids spend time in this . Chef of Spaghetti GmbH . They 
don &apos;t invest time in power struggles . 
But there &apos;s another reason , 
and that &apos;s that BWL students were trained to do a real plan . OK . 
And then to realize 
what happens when they do the Marshmallow on the top , OK ? They don &apos;t have time anymore . And what happens ? 
It &apos;s a crisis . 
Sounds familiar . 
What children do differently is they do with the Marshmallow and start prototypes and build . Successful prototypes , always with the Marshmallow at the top , so they have multiple opportunities to build dilapidated prototypes . 
Constructors recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of an iterative process . 
And every attempt to get the kids feedback directly , what works ? And what doesn &apos;t work like 
that is to work with prototypes . But let &apos;s see how different teams operate : 
The average for most is . At about 50 centimeters of BWL students , half of them are lawyers , but not much . Children &apos;s gardening kids are better than adults . 
Who &apos;s the most successful architect 
and engineer ? Fortunately . 
1M is the highest . What I &apos;ve seen 
and why ? Because they understand triangles and are self @-@ reinforcing geometric patterns . The key to building stable structures is 
that CEOs are slightly above average . But here it gets interesting . 
If you put an executive administrator . On the team , they get significantly better . 
It &apos;s incredible . You look around and you see . This team will win . You 
can predict that . Why is that ? 
Because you have special process monitoring skills . 
You run the process . You understand it , 
and that team that controls and controls the work . You pay attention to the performance of the team will significantly improve . 
Specialized skills and process skills and their combination will lead to success . 
If you have 10 teams that are typical , you get . CA : 6 : Stable structures . 
I tried something exciting . 
I thought , let &apos;s get the poker bet right away . 
So I offered a $ 10,000 prize for the winners . 
What do you think happened ? With these design students . 
What was that ? 
Result . This didn &apos;t happen . A team had a stable structure . 
If anyone had a two @-@ inch construction , he would have the prize home . 
So it &apos;s not interesting that high betting bets have a strong effect . 
We repeated this exercise with the same students . 
What do you think happened ? 
Well , you understood the advantage of prototyping . 
So it turned out to be one of the best of the best from the same bad team . 
They made the highest construction in the least time . 
So there are profound lessons for us about the nature of propulsion and success . 
You may ask . Why would someone actually invest time ? Creating a Marshmallow Challenge . 
The reason is , I help to create digital tools and processes to help teams . Cars , video games and visual effects . 
And what the Marshmallow Challenge does is it helps you identify hidden assumptions . 
Because frankly , every project has its own Marshmallow . The 
challenge is a shared experience . A common language or attitude , the right prototype to 
build . And this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise . 
And those of you who are interested in it can be MarshmallowChallenge . 
COM : It &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the Marshmallows . 
There &apos;s a step @-@ by @-@ step guide there . 
You can find crazy examples from around the world , like people . Optimize and refiner the system . 
There are also world records . 
And the basal lesson , I think , is construction , actually , a connecting sport . Is 
it required that we put all our senses on the task , and that we put our thinking to the best use , like our emotions and our actions , in the challenge ahead of us ? And 
sometimes a small prototype of this experience is . Everything it takes us from an UH @-@ Oh to a TA @-@ DA moment . 
And that can make a big difference . 
Thank you very much . 
Let &apos;s pretend we have a machine here . 
A big machine . A cool TED @-@ like machine . And this is a time machine . 
And everybody in this room has to enter . 
And you can go back to the past . You can go into the future . You can &apos;t go into this one . 
And now stay there . And I wonder what you would choose because I would be able to tell my friends a lot recently . And I asked this question , and they all wanted to go back to the past . 
I don &apos;t know . They wanted to go back to time before cars were there , or Twitter or America is looking for the superstar . 
I don &apos;t know . 
I &apos;m convinced that somehow you can go to nostalgia , wishful thinking . 
And I understand that . 
I &apos;m not part of it . I have to say to this group , &quot; 
I don &apos;t want to go back to the past , &quot; and not because I &apos;m an adventurer . 
It &apos;s because opportunities on this planet are not going back . They &apos;re going forward . 
So I want to go into this machine . And I want to go into the future . 
This is the greatest time it ever has on this planet . No matter what scale you &apos;re applying . Health , wealth . Mobility , opportunities , falling rates of disease . 
There has never been a time like this before . 
My great grandparents all died when they were 60 . 
My grandparents pushed this number to 70 . 
My parents are 80 on their heels . 
So there should be a nine . At the beginning of my death . 
But it &apos;s not even about people like us . Because this is a bigger thing than a child 
who &apos;s in New Delhi today can be expected to be born for so long as the richest man on the planet is alive . 100 years ago , 
think about it . This is an incredible fact . 
And why is this ? 
Skirts , smallpox has billions of people on this planet killed . 
They &apos;ve got the Earth &apos;s demographics in a way that it doesn &apos;t have war . Ever managed to do 
it . They &apos;re gone . They &apos;ve disappeared . 
We &apos;ve defeated them . Puff 
in the rich world : There are diseases that millions of us have just threatened a generation ago . Hardly any diphtheria is rubbing . 
Polio knows anything . Somebody else 
knows what that is . Vaccines 
, modern medicine . Our ability to feed billions of people . These are successes of the scientific method . 
And in my view , the scientific method is to try things out . Look . Whether it works , it changes . If it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity . 
So that &apos;s the good news . 
Unfortunately , that &apos;s the good news . Because there are some other problems . And they &apos;ve been mentioned many times , 
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people in the world are going hungry to bed every day . 
That number is rising , and it &apos;s rising very quickly . And that &apos;s embarrassing . 
And not just that . We have used our imagination to make this world thoroughly 
devastated : Drinking water . Urbare land , rainforests , oil . Gas . They disappear . And soon . And if we don &apos;t innovate out of this chaos , we disappear . 
So the question is , can we do that ? I think so . 
I think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food . The billions of people will feed without the land they live on rape . 
I think we can use energy to power this world that doesn &apos;t destroy it at the same time . 
I really think so . And no . This is not wishful thinking . 
But this is keeping me awake at night . One of the things that keeps me awake at night . We still have never seen so much scientific progress as we &apos;ve ever seen before . And 
we &apos;ve never been able to do it properly , so we &apos;ve been able to do it today . 
We &apos;re on the threshold of amazing , amazing events in many areas . And yet , I really think we &apos;ve been hundreds of 300 years before the Enlightenment had to go back to find a time when we &apos;re fighting progress . In which we &apos;re more vigorously tricked about these things on more fronts than we have now . 
People are wrapping themselves in their faith . And so tightly , you don &apos;t get rid of them . 
Not even the truth will liberate them . 
And listen . Everyone has a right to their opinions , even a right to their opinions on progress . 
But you know what they don &apos;t have a right to . 
They don &apos;t have a right to their own . Facts , charges , they don &apos;t have . 
And I took a while to figure out 
about one decade ago , I had an article about immunization for The Vaccines for The New Yorker , a little article . 
And I was amazed to encounter resistance . Resistance to what ended up being the most effective healthcare measure in the history of humanity , the most effective way to do it . 
I didn &apos;t know what to do . So I just did what I always do . I wrote an article and I went on . 
And soon afterwards , I wrote an article about genetically modified . Food : The 
same thing , just bigger . 
People were crazy . 
So I also have written an article about it . And I couldn &apos;t understand why people thought . That would be Frankenfood . Why ? They believed molecules were on a certain molecule , rather than a random way of moving around , an attack on the territory of nature . 
But you know , I do what I do . I wrote the article . I went on . 
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist . 
We type , we &apos;re rich . We go eating . That &apos;s okay . 
But these articles worried me . And I couldn &apos;t figure out why . And finally , I found out . 
And that &apos;s because these fanatics who mad me , they even didn &apos;t even be fanatics . 
These were prudent people . Educated people , decent people . 
They were just like the people in this room . 
And that got me so confused . 
But then I thought , &quot; You know what ? Let &apos;s be honest . 
We &apos;re at a point where we &apos;re not at the same relationship to progress as we were at the time . 
We &apos;re talking about it in two ways . 
We &apos;re talking about it in ironic terms . We &apos;re talking about it with small quotes , about progress . Okay 
. There are reasons for that . And I think we know what reasons that are . 
We have trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , lost . And there &apos;s no reason why that &apos;s not supposed to be like that . 
You can just name a few names . And people will understand 
Chernobyl , Bhopal , Challenger , Vioxx , weapons of mass destruction , the 2000 US presidential election . I mean , 
you know , you can choose your own list . 
There are questions and problems with people from whom we believed that they were always right . So be skeptical . 
Ask questions : Ask evidence . Ask evidence . 
Take evidence . Take nothing 
but given . But now , if you get evidence , you have to accept that evidence . And in that , we &apos;re not good . And I can 
do that for the reason that we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear , as I still do never see you . And hopefully never again , 
about 12 years ago , a story was published . A terrible story that the Autism epidemic with the measles , mumps and rubells associated vaccine . 
Very scary , 
upsetting , in a way . Studies were done to see if that was true , 
upward . Studies were to be done . This is a serious matter . 
The data came in . 
The data came in from the United States . England , Sweden , Canada . And they were all the same : No correlation , no connection , no connection . 
It makes no difference . It makes no difference because we believe in anecdotes . We believe what we see , what we believe to see , what causes us to feel real . 
We don &apos;t believe in a bundle of documents from a government agency that gives us data . And I understand that . I think we all do that . 
But you know what ? 
The result of that was catastrophic , catastrophic . 
Because of that fact , the United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is falling . 
That &apos;s scandalous . And we should be ashamed . 
It &apos;s terrible . 
What happened is that we could do that ? 
Well , I understand that . I do . 
Because did anybody here have measles ? 
Does one in the audience have a single one ? Anyone who sees someone die of measles 
doesn &apos;t happen very often . 
In this country , not at all . But 160,000 times in the world . Last year . 
These are many deaths from measles : 20 per hour . 
But because this hasn &apos;t happened here , we can displace it . And people like Jenny McCarthy can walk around and send messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like Oprah . And Larry King preach live . And 
you can do that because they cause and correlation not connect . 
You don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same . But almost never are the same . 
And that &apos;s something we need to learn . And that &apos;s very fast . 
This guy was a hero . Jonas Salk . 
He liberated us from one of the worst scourges of humanity : Don &apos;t 
fear , no pain , polio . Puff disappeared , the 
guy in the middle , not so much . 
His name is Paul Offit . 
He &apos;s just got with a few other people a rotavirus vaccine . 
He can live the lives of 400 , 500,000 children a year . In the developing world , it &apos;s 
pretty good to save . 
Not . Well , that &apos;s good . Apart from Paul walking around talking about vaccines and saying , &quot; How valuable they are , and that people just stop doing that , complaining . 
&quot; And that &apos;s what he actually says . 
So Paul is a terrorist . 
If Paul is speaking at a public hearing , he cannot speak without armed guards . 
He gets calls at home because people like to tell him they know where his children are going to school . 
And why ? Because Paul made a vaccine . 
I don &apos;t need to say that . But vaccines are essential . 
Take them away . Returning the diseases . Terrible diseases . And this is happening right now . 
We have in this country measles now . 
And this is getting worse . And pretty soon , kids will die of it again . Because this is just a question of numbers . 
And they &apos;re not just going to die of measles . 
What about polio ? Let &apos;s take that . Why not ? 
A fellow militant of mine told me a few weeks ago , and she said , &quot; She believes I &apos;m a little too shrill . 
Nobody has ever said that before . 
She wouldn &apos;t fight polio against her child . &quot; &quot; Absolutely not 
fine . 
Why ? &quot; &quot; Because we don &apos;t have polio . &quot; And you know what ? 
We had in this country yesterday no polio . 
Today , I don &apos;t know . Maybe this morning , it &apos;s up . Someone in Lagos , flying in an airplane , is flying to Los Angeles . Right now , he &apos;s over Ohio 
and in a few hours he lands . And he rents a car . And he comes to Long Beach . And he &apos;s going to be one of these fantastic TED dinner . And he &apos;s going to visit tonight , 
and he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s infected with a paralyzing disease . And we don &apos;t know . Because that &apos;s how the world works . 
Well , this is the planet on which we live . Don &apos;t pretend he &apos;s not . 
We love lying in lies . We love that . Do you 
all have that this morning ? 
You took your vitamins , Echinacea . A little antioxidant that will help you jump . 
I know you did that because the half of Americans did that every day because 
they did it . They take the stuff . And they take alternative remedies . And it doesn &apos;t make any difference how often we find that they &apos;re useless . 
The data records that all the time . 
They evaporate their urine more . Never do it . 
That &apos;s okay . You like 28 billion dollars for dark . Pay urine . 
I agree with you completely . 
Dark . Urine : Dark . 
Why do we do that ? Why do we do that ? 
Well , I think I understand . We hate the pharmaceutical industry . 
We hate too strong a government . We don &apos;t have confidence in the system . 
And we shouldn &apos;t . Our healthcare system is bad . 
It &apos;s cruel to millions of people . 
It &apos;s absolutely amazing , cold and soul @-@ reeling , even to us who can afford it . 
So we &apos;re walking away from it , and where are we going ? 
We &apos;re walking into the arms of the placebo industry . 
That &apos;s great . I love the placebo industry . 
But you know , that &apos;s really a serious matter . Because the stuff is crap . And we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it . 
And I have all sorts of little props here , 
none of them : Gingko fraud , Echinacea fraud , Acai . I don &apos;t even know what that is . But we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it . It &apos;s cheating . 
And you know what ? When I say that , people scream at me and say , &quot; What cares you ? &quot; &quot; Let people do what they want . 
&quot; So they feel good . And 
you know what ? They &apos;re wrong 
because I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the Health Minister . He says , &quot; Hmm . &quot; I &apos;m going to get the evidence from my experts on mammography , or any cancer quack liver that wants to treat his patients with coffee intakes . 
If you go down that path , where faith and magic , evidence and science replace , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be . 
You get to Thabo Mbeki in South Africa . 
He brought 400,000 of his people around because he insisted that red beds , garlic and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs , of which we know they &apos;re the course of AIDS @-@ inhibiting drugs . 
Hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country worse than any other country plagued by this disease . 
Please do not tell me that these things have no consequences . They have them 
, they always have them . 
Now , the most unwieldy epidemic we &apos;re in is this absurd fight between the advocates of genetically modified food . And the bio @-@ elite . 
This is an idiotic debate . It has to stop . 
It &apos;s a debate about words about metaphors . 
This is ideology , not science . 
Everything we eat , every grain of rice . Every branch of parsley . Every sprouts has been changed by people . 
You know , there were no mandarin in paradise . 
There were no cantaloupe melons . There were no Christmas trees . We did all of that . 
We did it in the last 11,000 years . 
And some of it worked and some of it didn &apos;t . 
We got rid of what didn &apos;t work . 
Now we can make it more accurate . And of course , there are risks . But we can do something like vitamin A in rice . And the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , to prolong their lives . 
They don &apos;t want to do that . 
I have to say , I don &apos;t understand . 
We reject genetically modified food . 
Why do we do that ? 
Well , what I hear all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture . We don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing . That &apos;s wrong . 
We don &apos;t want companies to patent lives . 
We don &apos;t want companies to own seeds . 
And you know what ? My answer to all of that is 
yes . You &apos;re right . Let &apos;s fix that . 
It &apos;s true . We have a huge food problem . But that &apos;s not science . 
That &apos;s not science . 
It &apos;s quite morality , patent crab . 
You know that science is not a company . 
It &apos;s not a country . 
It &apos;s not even an idea . It &apos;s a process . 
It &apos;s a process . And sometimes it works . And sometimes it doesn &apos;t . But the idea that we don &apos;t want to allow science to do its work , because we &apos;re afraid , is a real impasse . And it keeps millions of people from flourishing . 
You know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to grow 70 percent more food . When at the moment , 70 percent of 
this investment in Africa over the last 30 years has 
been shameful , shameful . 
You need that . And we &apos;re not giving it to you . 
And why genetically modified food ? 
We don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this rotten stuff , like Maniok . 
Maniok is something that &apos;s half a billion . People eat . 
It &apos;s about like a potato . 
It &apos;s just a bunch of calories . It &apos;s bad . 
It doesn &apos;t have nutrients . It doesn &apos;t have protein . And scientists are building all this right in there . 
And then people could eat it and wouldn &apos;t become blind . 
They wouldn &apos;t starve . And you know what ? 
That would be nice . It wouldn &apos;t be Chez Panisse . But it would be nice . 
And everything I can say about this is , why do we fight this ? 
I mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why do we fight this ? 
Because we don &apos;t want to push genes around . 
It &apos;s not about pushing genes around . It &apos;s not about chemicals . 
It &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones . Our insistence on greater food , better food , unique food . 
It &apos;s not about Rice Krispies . It &apos;s about keeping people alive . And it &apos;s high time to understand what that means . 
Because you know what ? 
If we don &apos;t do that , if we keep going as we do . Let &apos;s be guilty of something we believe in , I don &apos;t want to be guilty of . High @-@ tech colonialism . 
There &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here . 
It &apos;s selfish . It &apos;s ugly . It &apos;s not worthy of us . And we really have to stop that . 
After this incredibly fun conversation , you might want to say , &quot; Do you still want to be in ? &quot; This ridiculous time machine and going into the future 
, definitely . I want that anyway . 
She &apos;s in the present moment . But we have an incredible opportunity . 
We can put this time machine on everything we want . 
We can move it where we want to move it . And we &apos;ll move it to where we want it to be . 
We need to have these conversations . And we need to think . But if we go into the time machine and go into the future , we &apos;ll be happy to have done that . 
I know we can . And as far as I &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs now . 
Thank you . 
Thank you . When Steve Lopez , columnist of the Los Angeles Times , One day through the streets in the center of Los Angeles , he heard wonderful music . 
She came from a man , an African @-@ American , sympathetic , rough , homeless , who was playing on a violin that had only two strings left . 
Many of you will know the story . Because from Steve &apos;s article about it , later on , a book that was filmed again with Robert Downey Junior . When Steve Lopez and Jamie Foxx were Nathaniel Anthony Ayers , the contrabass player who studied at the Juilliard Conservatory , and tragically early on , his promising career was ended by paranoid schizophrenia . 
Nathaniel left Juilliard , suffered a nervous breakdown , and 30 years later he lived as homeless on the streets of Skid Row in the center of Los Angeles . 
I recommend to you all to read Steves &apos; book or watch the movie so that you can not only understand the wonderful interconnectedness that exists between these two men , but also how the music , these connections , helped to make . And how they eventually became the instrument when this play of words is allowed . That half Nathaniel off the road to get away . 
I met Mr. Ayers . In 2008 , two years ago , in the Walt Disney Concert Hall . 
He just had a demonstration of Beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony and came behind the stage to get me to imagine . 
He spoke in a very cheerful and sociable tone about yo @-@ yo . MA : And Hillary Clinton and about how the Dodgers never put it into the Baseball World Series . And all of this because of the insidious passage of the first violin in the last sentence of Beethoven . Fourth Symphony : 
We came up with the theme of &quot; Speaking Music &quot; and a few days later , I got an email saying that Nathaniel was in favour of violin lessons with me . 
I have to mention that Nathaniel is opposed to medical treatment because he was already with electric shocks . And with thorazine and handcuffs , he was treated with trauma that his whole life . 
Had him persecuted as a result , he &apos;s now particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases . They &apos;re sometimes so bad that they can threaten to tear him apart . And he disappears in the streets of Skid Row for days wandering around . Always , this horror and the torture torment of his own mind is exposed . 
And in just such a charming stage , Nathaniel was when we were at our first lesson in Walt Disney Concert Hall , where we started . He had this crazy flickering in his eyes and he was totally lost . 
He talked about invisible demons and smoke and about how someone in sleep poisoning him . 
I was afraid not for me , but I was afraid I could lose him , that he could lose him , that he could sink into one of his states , and that I could destroy his relationship with the violin . When I started talking about clay ladders and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy . 
So I just started playing . 
I played the first movement of Beethoven &apos;s violin concerto . 
And as I played , I noticed that in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes , a complete change was taking place . 
It was as if under the influence of an invisible doctor &apos;s nei . A chemical reaction , whose catalyst was my game , 
Nathaniel &apos;s maniac anger , turned into understanding , into a calm curiosity and grace . 
And as if by a miracle , he took his violin and began to listen . Some excerpts of violin concerts to play , and then asked me to finish playing them . Mendelssohn Chaikovsky , Sibelius . 
We started then to talk about music . From Bach to Beethoven , Brahms , Bruckner and all the other BS from Bartók to Beethoven , from Esa @-@ Pekka Salonen . 
And I realized that he wasn &apos;t just an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but he had it with her , but also a close personal relationship . 
He talked to her about a passion and an understanding that I otherwise only talked about by my colleagues in the Philharmonic of Los Angeles , by 
sharing music , playing music and about music , was . From this paranoid , confused man who was just walking through the streets of Los Angeles , a kind , educated , excellent Juilliard @-@ trained musician . 
Music is medicine . Music changes us 
for Nathaniel . Does music mean mental health 
? Because music allows him to have his thoughts and delusions through his imagination and creativity in his own real 
form . And so he escapes his tormenting state . 
I understood that that was the essence of art . 
Exactly . That &apos;s why we make music so that we can do something that is deep inside of us all . Our emotions through our artistic lens , through our creativity , can shape into reality . 
And the reality of that expression reaches us all , moving , inspiring and uniting us . 
What Nathaniel was doing , the music brought him back to a community of friends , 
the redeeming power of music brought him back to a family of musicians . He understood the talent that he recognized and respected . 
And I keep coming to music with Nathaniel . Whether in Walt Disney Concert Hall or in Skid Row , because he reminds me of this why I &apos;m becoming a musician . 
Thank you very much . 
Bruno Giussani : Thank you very much . Thank you . 
Robert Gupta : 
Robert Gupta . I want to play something that I shamefully stolen from the cellist . 
I hope you forgive me . 
I &apos;m Jane McGonigal . I design computer games . 
I &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years now . And my goal for the next decade is to be just as easy to do . The world in reality to save as it is in online games to 
save . I have a plan for that . I want to convince more people , including all of you , more time playing bigger and more amazing games . 
We &apos;re spending three billion hours a week now playing online . 
Some of you may think so . This is a lot of time for games . 
Maybe a little too much time . If you think about how many problems we &apos;re facing in the real world urgently , we need to solve them . In 
fact , but my research at the Institute for the Future , according to me , is exactly the opposite . 
Right ? Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to address the world &apos;s most pressing problems . 
Indeed , I am convinced that if we move on to this planet for the next century , we want to dramatically increase that time . 
I calculated that the time needed was 21 billion hours of playing time . That &apos;s 
per week . That seems a little bit absurd first , maybe . So I &apos;ll repeat it with that . It can work if we can have problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , I think we need to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours per week by the end of the next decade . 
No . I mean , it &apos;s really serious . 
Why ? This 
picture quite accurately describes why . I think games are so vital to the survival of the human species in the future . Serious . 
This is a portrait of the photographer . Phil Toledano . 
He wanted to capture the feelings of playing . So he &apos;s in front of the players a camera . 
This is one of the classic expressions . 
When playing , if you &apos;re not a player , you may miss them . Some of the nuances in this picture . 
You probably see this sense of urgency , some fear , but also extreme concentration , deeply immersed in solving a really difficult problem . 
If you play , you see some nuances . Here &apos;s the upward @-@ drawn eyes . And the mouth is a sign of optimism . The eyebrows show surprise . 
This is a player on the edge of what &apos;s called an epic victory . 
Oh , you know that . 
OK . Great . So we have some players here , 
an epic . Victory is a result that &apos;s so extraordinarily positive that it &apos;s not known before that it &apos;s possible at all . 
It was almost beyond imagination . And if you get there , you &apos;re shocked that you &apos;re actually capable of doing 
that . This is an epical victory . 
This player is about to win an epic victory . 
And this is what we see on millions of faces of problem solvers around the world . If we can see the hurdles of the next century , the face of those who face the edge of an epic victory 
, against all odds . Well , unfortunately , we see this face in real life . If we face difficult problems , I call 
it that , in life , I am . I &apos;m bad face , and it &apos;s actually 
my face . See , yeah . OK . That &apos;s me . How I 
am that in life , I &apos;m bad . Face making . 
This is a graffiti in my former home country , Berkeley . California , where I studied in my Ph.D. thesis why we &apos;re better at playing than in real life . 
This is a problem . This is a problem that many players have . 
We think in reality we &apos;re not as good as playing . And 
I mean , not only less successful , although that &apos;s part of it . 
We &apos;re getting more in play worlds . 
I mean , good in terms of motivation to do something meaningful . Inspired in collaboration with each other . 
If we &apos;re in a game world , I think many of us are in our best version , at any time and immediately , ready to help , persistent . Solving the problem , trying to solve it as long as necessary , try it again after the failure . 
And in reality , if we fail , if we encounter obstacles , we often feel different . 
We feel overwhelmed . We feel defeated . We feel threatened . Maybe depressed , frustrated or cynical . 
We never have those feelings . When we play games in games , they just don &apos;t exist . 
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m studying as a PhD student . 
Why is it impossible to think in games ? You couldn &apos;t just achieve everything . 
How can we get those feelings out of games into reality ? 
So I looked at games like World of Warcraft , which is the ideal environment for solving problems together . 
And I noticed a few things . The epic victories in online worlds make it possible . 
So first of all , if you &apos;re going to join one of these online games , especially at World of Warcraft , there are a lot of different characters willing to entrust you with a world saving mission . And that immediately . 
But not just any mission , but a mission that &apos;s perfect for your current level . In the game , it fits 
right . So you do it . 
You never get a task that you can &apos;t solve . 
But always on the edge of your skills , so you have to make an effort . 
But there &apos;s no unemployment in World of Warcraft . You &apos;re not sitting around and turning around demons . There &apos;s always something very important to do . And 
there are , in a way , 
employees wherever they go . Hundreds of thousands of people working with them to complete their epic mission . 
We have that in real life , not that easy . This feeling that , when you have fingerprints , you have staff who are willing to do it in ways , 
and there &apos;s this epic story . This inspiring story , why we &apos;re there . And what we have to do is we get this whole positive feedback . 
You &apos;ve certainly got from level up and 1 strength , or 1 intelligence . 
This constant feedback is not in real life . 
If I leave this stage , I don &apos;t have 1 speech and 1 crazy idea . 20 crazy idea . 
I get in real life . 
This feedback is not . So the problem of collaborative online worlds like World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying . Anytime on the brink of an epic victory , that we prefer to be on the brink of our entire life in these games . 
They &apos;re just better than reality . 
To date , all World of Warcraft players have come together . 5.93 million years have spent virtual problems of Azerbaijan &apos;s 
virtual problems . That &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing . 
It may sound bad . But let &apos;s just look 
at it in context : 5.93 million years ago . Our first primate ancestors started walking upright . 
The first upright primacy . 
So OK . So when we talk about how much time we have to spend playing at the moment . Does that make sense ? When do you spend time with regard to the scale of human development , when do you remember ? What 
&apos;s extraordinary , but also appropriate ? Because it turns out that by doing this whole time , we &apos;re using it all on play , actually , changing it . What 
we as humans are able to do ? We &apos;re becoming too community . 
Thinking , heartfelt beings . That &apos;s the truth . That &apos;s what I believe in . 
Just look at these interesting statistics that were recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University . The average young person today in a country with a strong playing culture spends . 10,000 hours playing online until the age of 21 . 
So 10,000 . Hours is a very interesting number . For two reasons : 
First of all , for children in the United States . 10,080 hours , the exact total time they spend in school , from the fifth grade to the end of high school , If you never miss it , 
so here we have a complete parallel education path . On the same day , young people learn what it means . A good player , like anything else they learn in school , to be a good player . And maybe 
some of you have the new book by Malcolm Gladwell . Overflying people , so you know his theory of success . The theory of success of 10,000 hours . 
It &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science that if we spend 10,000 hours with laborious study of any subject , up to the age of 21 , we will master . In it , 
we will be so good at it . Whatever to do , like the most important people in the world . 
So what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are master players . 
The big question is , what ? Exactly , are players masterfully good ? Because 
if we could figure out that out , we would have , kind of , never before , ever @-@ known human potential at our disposal . 
So many people we have in the world right now , who have at least an hour a day playing online . 
These are our master players . 500 million people who are exceptionally good at something . 
And over the next decade , we have another billion players who are exceptionally good at whatever . 
If you haven &apos;t heard it yet , 
the game industry is developing consoles . Saving energy and working on mobile networks , rather than broadband Internet . So players around the world , especially in India . China , Brazil , playing online , 
you can expect an additional billion players . The next decade . 
So we have a total of 1.5 billion players . 
So I started thinking about what it is , what these games are to make us master . 
Here are the four things I found . First , urgency optimism . 
OK , imagine how extreme self @-@ motivation . 
Urgency optimism is desire to do something right away . Mastering a hurdle , along with believing that we have a reasonable hope of success . 
Players always believe that an epical victory is possible , and that it &apos;s always worth it to try and try , and that is , 
equal players don &apos;t sit around . 
Players are masters . In spiders , poets of social networks . 
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research . These are the ones that show us that we like people more . After we played with them , even if they beat us badly . 
The reason for this is that there &apos;s a lot of trust that it takes to play a game with someone . 
We trust that somebody will spend time with us , that the rules will be respected . That we have the same goal , and that we will stay with them until the end of the game . 
So that allows for interaction . The growth of ties , trust and interconnectedness as 
a result . We build stronger social relationships , happy 
productivity . Fantastic . 
You know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of warcraft player plays 22 hours a week . So , part @-@ time job . 
The reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier at working hard . As if we relax or do nothing , 
we know that we are human beings that work optimally . When we do hard , significant work , 
and players are always willing to work hard . When they get the right job and 
eventually epic meaning , 
players love it as part of awe @-@ inspiring . Missions of planetary proportions . 
Here &apos;s a background information to get this right . You probably know all Wikipedia . The biggest Wiki in the world . The 
second largest Wiki in the world , with almost 80,000 entries , is : The World of Warcraft @ Wiki 
Five Millions of people . Use it everybody . Monthly . 
You have more information about World of Warcraft online than you have about any other topic . In any other Wiki in the world , 
you &apos;re creating an epic story . 
You &apos;re creating an epic source of knowledge about the World of Warcraft . 
OK . So these are four superpowers that are leading to a single result . Players are super @-@ powerful , hopeful individuals . 
They &apos;re people who believe that they , as individuals , can change the world . 
And the only problem is they believe . They can change the virtual worlds , but not the real ones . 
That &apos;s the problem I &apos;m trying to solve . 
Edward Castronova is a scientist . 
His work is awesome . 
He &apos;s studying why people have so much time , energy and money in online worlds . 
And he says , &quot; We &apos;re witnessing nothing less than mass emigration into virtual worlds and online gaming environments . &quot; 
And this is from an economist . So he &apos;s logical . 
And he doesn &apos;t say the way I do . I develop games . I &apos;m a little bit exuberant . 
So he says , &quot; That actually makes sense . &quot; Because players can achieve more in online worlds than in real life . 
They can play games that have stronger social ties than they do in real life . They get more feedback and rewards in games . Than in real life , 
so he says , &quot; It &apos;s perfectly logical right now that players have more time in the virtual world than in real life . 
&quot; I agree with that . That &apos;s logical . 
But it &apos;s definitely . It &apos;s not an optimal situation . 
We have to start to put the real world into a game . 
My inspiration comes from an event . It &apos;s 2,500 years back . 
There are these ancient cubes of sheep &apos;s cocks . You know , 
before these fantastic game econtrollers , there were sheep &apos;s cocks . 
And these were , so to speak , the first game tools developed by humans . And if you &apos;re working with the works of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus . You might know this story ? The story about how and why games were invented , 
according to Herodotus , became . Games , more precisely craps in the kingdom of Lydia , invented during famine . 
There was supposedly such a great famine that the king of Lydia became a crazy idea that the king of 
Lydia decided to do . People suffered , people fought . 
It was an extreme situation . It took an extreme solution . 
So they invented the craps according to Herodotus and agreed a national strategy . In one day you would eat . The next day you would play . 
And they would play so much deeper into craps . There are games so fascinating and satisfying , happy productivity around us that they would forget that it &apos;s nothing to eat , 
right ? And then the next day you would play . And the next day you would eat . 
And according to Herodotus , they survived for 18 years . This famine by living in one day and eating the next . 
And I think that &apos;s the same way we &apos;re starting to play today . 
We &apos;re putting games in order to respond to the suffering of the real world . We &apos;re putting games in order to escape everything that &apos;s happening in the real world . Everything that &apos;s not satisfying in real life . And we &apos;re getting what we need . From the games . 
But that doesn &apos;t have to be the end . 
That &apos;s the exciting thing . 
According to Herodotus , after 18 years of famine , famine didn &apos;t get any better . So the king decided to start a final dice game . 
They divided the kingdom in two halves . 
They played a dice game . And the winners were allowed to break into an epic adventure . 
They left lydia and they went looking for a new home . They just left so many people back as food to survive . And they were looking for the rest for a neighborhood in which they thrive , where they could thrive . 
That sounds crazy , right ? 
But the latest DNA evidence shows that the Etruscans , who later formed the Roman Empire , are . The same DNA as the ancient Lydians . 
So scientists recently came to the conclusion that herodotus &apos;s crazy story is actually true . 
And geologists found evidence of global cooling that lasted almost 20 years , which explains famine , right ? So 
this crazy story could be true . Maybe 
they actually have their people saved by playing by 18 years of saving themselves in games , and they could have saved their people by playing . And then they had this inspiration , and so much learned about playing with each other that it would save the entire civilization . 
So we can . 
We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft since 1994 . 
This was the first real @-@ time strategy game . The World of Warcraft series . 
This was 16 years ago . 
They played craps for 18 years . We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft for 16 years . 
I &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game . 
So they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world . So I &apos;m taking my 21 billion hours of play a week . 
We should agree that half of us are one hour a day with games , right ? Until we solve the problems of the real 
world . I know you &apos;re going to ask . How do we solve problems of the real world in games ? And 
that &apos;s exactly the question I have in my work . In recent years , at the Institute for the Future , 
we &apos;ve been dedicating this banner to our office in Palo Alto . It expresses how we understand the future . 
We don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before 
we want to , what we want is to create the future . 
We want to imagine the best possible outcome . And then empower people to empower this idea to become reality . 
We face epic victories and give people the opportunity to make it happen . 
I &apos;ll show you three games I designed very briefly to try and try to make people epic victories in their own future , in my own right . 
This is a world without oil . 
The game is from 2007 . 
It &apos;s an online game where you can overcome an oil shortage . 
Oil shortages are invented . But we have enough online content to make it realistic for you and to make you a real life . In fact , without oil , live . So if you sign up to the game , tell us where you live . And then you get real @-@ time news movies showing you how much oil costs , which is not there . How food supplies are affected , 
how transportation is affected , whether schools are closed . Whether there are riots . And you have to figure out how to shape your real life . If it were true , and we ask you to blog about it , to hire videos or photos . 
We have this 1,700 @-@ player game in 2007 . And we &apos;ve been testing it since then for the last three years . 
And I can tell you it was a changing experience . 
Nobody wants to change their lives because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should . 
But if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and you &apos;re told , &quot; Get us going . &quot; &quot; Oil out . 
&quot; This is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re going to go on . 
Find out how you would survive . Most of our players have learned from the game . Preserving habits , so we &apos;ve 
chosen the next world saving game . A bigger , higher goal than just oil shortages . 
We &apos;ve got the Superstruct game at the Institute for the Future . 
The starting point is to calculate a supercomputer that people only have 23 years on the planet left . 
This supercomputer is called Global Dignition . Sentilation system , of course , 
the call for players to sign up . Do we have almost designed a Jerry Bruckheimer movie ? 
You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies , where there &apos;s the dream team . You have the astronaut , the scientist , the ex @-@ Sträfling , and only together can you save the world . 
But in our game , instead of just five people , we say , &quot; Everyone is on the dream team . &quot; And it &apos;s our job to build the future for energy , food , health , safety and the future of social justice . 
8,000 players played the game . For eight weeks . 
They found 500 . Incredible . Creative solutions that they can read . If you Google Superstruct and bring 
the last game , we will be out on March 3 . It &apos;s a game in collaboration with the World Bank . 
If you complete the game , you get the World Bank award for &quot; Social Reformer 2010 &quot; . We work 
with universities across Sub @-@ Saharan Africa and invite you to learn how to redesign socially . 
We have a comic book on this . We have levels high for regional understanding . Knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and ingenuity . 
I want to invite you all to play this game with young people . Everywhere in the world , especially in development areas , which benefit from sharing their own social ventures together to imagine the world to save . 
Now I &apos;m going to finish . 
I want to ask you something : 
What do you think is happening ? Next , 
we have all these fantastic players . We have games that show us what we can do . But we have the real world not yet saved . 
Well , I hope you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games are a big deal of importance for change . 
We have all these superpowers , happy productivity . The ability to build tight social networks , urgency optimism . And the desire for epiepical meaning . 
I really hope that together we play important games . To play another century on this planet to survive , and 
I hope you will join me in designing and playing games like this . 
When I look forward to the next decade , I &apos;m sure about two things : That we &apos;re able to create any imaginable future , and that we can play all kinds of games . So I &apos;m saying , let &apos;s play the world @-@ changing games . Let &apos;s start . 
Thank you . 
For some time now , I &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect . It may seem strange that a magician is interested in it . Unless you look at it like me , it &apos;s a deception that leads to something real . If someone is just firmly enough to believe in it , 
in other words , have sugar pills . In some studies , a measurable effect has been the placebo effect , only because the person thinks what to do with it is . A pharmaceutical or some kind of pain management . For example , if the patient is only firm enough to believe in it , there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect . 
A deception becomes something real because somebody like this perceives it so 
that we can understand each other , and I want to give you a basic , very simple magic trick . 
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . This is a trick that has been in every magic book for kids since at least the 1950s . 
I myself have taken it from the Cub Scout Magic . The scout scout in the 1970s . 
I &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it to you . 
And then I &apos;m going to explain why I explain it . 
So you see what happens . 
The knife you can look at . My hand you can look at . 
I &apos;m just going to look at the knife like this . I &apos;m going to stick in my fist , I &apos;m 
going to push my sleeves back . 
And to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeves or comes out of it , I &apos;m just going to get my wrist . Right here , 
squeeze it together in this way . You can see that at no time is anything moving . As long as I &apos;m pressurizing here , nothing can go in my sleeves or come out . 
And the goal is very simple . 
I &apos;m going to open my hand . And hopefully if everything goes well , the knife will go through my bare physical magnetism . 
It &apos;s actually so firmly in its place that I can shake it without the knife shaking down , nothing moves 
in my sleeves or comes in out , no trickery . And you can study everything , 
TA @-@ DA . 
Now , this is a trick that I often teach small kids who are interested in magic . Because you can learn a lot about deception . If you look more closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick to do . 
I think many of you here in the room probably know . This trick , it works . 
Here &apos;s how it works . 
I hold the knife . In my hand . 
I say I close my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or comes out . And that &apos;s a lie . 
The reason I hold my wrist is because it contains the actual secret of the illusion of the wrist . 
The moment I put my hand off of you , so that you turn it from behind , it moves . This finger , my index finger , just moves from where it was to a position where it was stretched out like this . 
Great trick : 
There &apos;s somebody sitting behind there who had no childhood . 
So he &apos;s right here . 
And when I turn around , the finger changes its position , 
and now you could talk about it . Why ? The one thing is , why not realize that down here , only three fingers are visible . Because the mind and the way it processes information , they &apos;re not counting individually . One , two , three , but seeing them as a group . 
But that &apos;s what this is not really about now . And then I open my hand . 
Of course , it &apos;s being held there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but by a trick , by my index finger , which is there now . 
And when I close my hand , the same thing happens : I turn back . That movement conceals that the finger is moving back . 
I take that hand away . And here &apos;s the knife . 
This trick you can use to show your friends and neighbors . Thank you . 
Now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ? 
A year ago or so , I read a study that really bypassed me . 
I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher . And that &apos;s why for me , it was an amazing thing . Because what 
it turned out to be is this . If you have a placebo in the form of a white pill in the form . An aspirin tablet is just a round white . Pill that has a certain measurable effect . 
But if you have the shape in which you give placebo , for example , into a smaller pill , change it . And color it blue and embosse a letter on it , it &apos;s actually measurably more effective . 
And that , though none of them are any pharmaceutical . They &apos;re just sugar pills . 
But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill , 
which made me really freak out . 
But it turned out that &apos;s not all that . 
If you take capsules , they &apos;re even more effective than tablets . Any shape , 
a colored capsule , yellow at one end . And red at the other end is better than a white capsule . 
Dosage also plays a role . 
A pill twice . Not so good as three pills every day . I can &apos;t get to the exact statistics now . Sorry . 
But the key thing is that 
dosage also plays a role , 
and the shape plays a role . 
And if you have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to grab the needle . 
Right ? A syringe with an ineffective one . A few milliliters of an ineffective substance that you inject into a patient . 
This creates a very strong image in your head . That &apos;s much stronger than a white pill . 
This graph is really . I &apos;m going to show you another time . If we have a projector , 
the fact is that the white pill isn &apos;t as good as the blue pill , which isn &apos;t so good . Like a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle , 
and none of it has any really pharmaceutical property . It &apos;s just our belief in it , which has a stronger effect in us . 
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a magic trick . 
I take something that is obviously a deception , and I make it look real . 
We know from that study that you can grab a needle if it &apos;s to get to the point . 
This is an 18 @-@ inch @-@ long needle . It &apos;s very , very sharp . And I &apos;m going to sterilize it a little bit first . 
This is really my flesh . It &apos;s not Damian &apos;s special . Breared meat . 
This is my skin . This is not a special effect from Hollywood . 
I &apos;m going to put this needle in my skin and through it , until it goes on the other side , and it goes out again . 
If you &apos;re getting bad , if you &apos;re easily fainting . I have a couple of friends . Last night , I showed it in the hotel room and some people I didn &apos;t know . And there &apos;s a woman almost fainthead . 
So I propose , if you &apos;re getting bad quickly , look for the next 30 seconds away . Or you know what ? I &apos;m going to get the first delicate part back here . 
You can see it in a moment . But you can also look away if you want . 
So it &apos;s going to be right here where my meat starts . On the lower part of my arm , I &apos;m just going to make a little bit of a break . 
I &apos;m really sorry . Is it crazy ? And now , just 
. A little bit through my skin . And on the other side , just get 
out again . Now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had with the knife trick . 
About , 
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers . Or ... So I 
&apos;m going to show you . This is one , two , three , four , five . 
Well , 
I know what people think . If you see this , 
you say , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s probably not so stupid . &quot; And it &apos;s just sticking through the skin to just let us know for a few minutes . 
Well , then I &apos;ll show you . 
What does this look like ? Very good . 
Yes . I know . And people back there say , &quot; Okay . &quot; I didn &apos;t really see that . People 
in the adjoining rooms are now coming in . 
Let me tell you from near here . This is 
really my skin . This is not a special effect from Hollywood . 
This is my flesh . And I can turn this around . 
Sorry if you &apos;re getting bad . Look away . Don &apos;t look at it . 
People in the back , or those who sometime later see this on video , will say , Well , yes . That looks pretty right . Impressive . But if it were real , he would see you . Here &apos;s a hole . And there , if it was really real , it would bleed . Okay . 
Let me add a little blood to you . 
Yeah , here it is . 
Normally , I would take out the needle now . 
I would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds there . 
But I think in this frame here and with the intention of delusion , I think something real will be made out of the needle , just let the needle in there . And so , from the stage , 
we &apos;re going to go in the next few days and meet again . 
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . Thank you very much . 
So I &apos;ve had a lot of fish in my life . 
I just loved two . 
This first one was more like a passionate affair . 
It was a beautiful one . Fish tasty . Good consistency , rich . Best seller . 
On the menu . 
What else better fish ! It became aquaculture after the supposedly highest standards of sustainability . 
So you could feel comfortable growing it for sale . 
I had a relationship with this beauty for several months . 
One day , the company &apos;s CEO called and asked , &quot; Would I be able to talk at an event about the sustainability of the farm ? 
&quot; Of course , I said , 
&quot; Here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem had become for our chefs . How do we keep fish on our menus ? 
&quot; Over the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the seas , we &apos;ve been barking forests . 
It &apos;s hard to overstate destruction . 
90 percent of the big fish we love , the tuna , the curative butte , the salmon , the swordfish . They &apos;ve collapsed . 
It &apos;s almost nothing left . 
So , aquaculture is likely to become bad or bad . Fish growing . Part of our future . 
Many arguments . On the other hand , fish farming is polluting the environment . Most of you anyway . And they &apos;re inefficient . Let &apos;s take tuna . A big disadvantage . 
It &apos;s got 15 percent feed recovery . That &apos;s 15 pounds . 
Wild fish are needed to get one pound of farmed tuna , 
not taste very sustainable . 
Not very good either . 
So here was finally a company . It tried to get it right . 
I wanted to support them 
the day before the event , I called the public relations chief for the company . 
Let &apos;s call him . 
Don Don , I just said the facts . Right ? You &apos;re famous for that . So far out in the sea , you don &apos;t pollute the environment 
. That &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; We &apos;re so far out that the waste is distributed by our fish , not concentrated . And 
then he added . &quot; We &apos;re essentially a world of our own . 
This 2.5 percent feed recovery to one , &quot; he said , 
&quot; the best in the industry , 
2.5 to one , great , 2.5 . 
&quot; To one , what feeds ? Your 
sustainable proteins , he said . 
&quot; Great , &quot; he said . &quot; I put up . 
&quot; And that evening , I lay in bed thinking , &quot; What the hell is a sustainable protein ? 
&quot; So the next day , just before the event , I called Don . 
I said , &quot; Don , what , for example , are sustainable ? &quot; 
Proteins . He said , &quot; He doesn &apos;t know . &quot; He &apos;s going to ask . 
Well , I telephoned a few people in the company . Nobody could give me a proper answer until I finally got to talk to the leading biologist , 
let &apos;s call him also . 
Don Don , I said , &quot; What , for example , are sustainable ? &quot; 
Proteins . Well , he mentioned some algae . And some fishmeal . And then he said , &quot; Chicken pellets . &quot; 
I said , chicken pellets . He 
said , &quot; Yes . &quot; Feathers . Skin . Bone flour , residues dried and processed into food . 
I said , &quot; How much percent of your food is chicken ? &quot; 
Assuming maybe two percent ? 
Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , he said . 
I said , &quot; Don . &quot; &quot; What &apos;s sustainable about feeding chicken to fish ? &quot; 
There was a long break in the pipeline . And he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot; 
I fell in love with this fish . 
No . Not because I &apos;m a self @-@ righteous connoisseur and a good man . 
That &apos;s me . Even 
no . I &apos;m actually not in love with this fish because I swear to God , &quot; The fish after this conversation , after chicken has tasted . &quot; This 
second fish . This is another kind of love story . 
It &apos;s the romantic species , the way you ever better love your fish , the better you know your fish . You learn the fish the more you love . 
I first got it in a restaurant in southern Spain . 
A friend journalist had long been talking about this fish . 
She kind of cuddled us . 
He came on the table with a bright one . Almost shimmering white color . 
The cook had cooked it . 
Hold twice . 
Amazingly , he was still delicious . 
Who can fish ? So good taste after it was cooked . 
I can &apos;t . But this guy can . 
Let &apos;s call it . Miguel . In fact , he &apos;s called Miguel . 
And no . He doesn &apos;t cook the fish . And he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that they do . And I understand it as 
a biologist at Veta La Palma . 
This is a fish rearing in the southwest corner of Spain . 
It &apos;s near the mouth of the river Guadalquivir , 
until the 1980s . The farm in the hands of Argentines . 
They grew meat cattle on what basically were wetlands . 
They did this by draining the land . 
They built this complicated sequence of canals , and they pushed water out of the country and out into the river . 
Now , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not be economical 
and environmentally , it was a disaster . 
It brought about 90 percent of the birds around , which is a lot of birds for this place . 
And so in 1982 , a Spanish company with environmental awareness bought the land . 
What did they do ? 
They bought the river of water in reverse . 
They literally put the lever around . 
Instead of pushing the water out , they used the channels . To pull the water back in . 
They flooded the channels . 
They created an 11,000 acres of fish rearing : Perch , sea ash , shrimp , eel . And in doing so , Miguel and his company completely reversed the ecological destruction . 
The farm is incredible . 
I mean , they &apos;ve never seen anything like this before . 
They &apos;re staring out onto the horizon that &apos;s a million miles away . And everything you see is flooded canals . And this dense , lush march . 
I was there , not long ago , with Miguel . 
He &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts : Charles Darwin , and one part : A crocodile for kissing . 
Okay . There we were , and we fought through wetlands . And I chastise . And sweat has mud up to my knees . And Miguel keeps calm . A biology lecture . 
Here he lifts a rare track . 
Now he mentions the mineral needs of phytoplankton . 
And here . Here he sees a pattern of bundles that will bring him to mind Tanzanian giraffe . 
It turns out Miguel is the majority of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa , in the middle of his career . 
I asked him how he could become a fish expert . 
He said , &quot; Fish , I don &apos;t know about fish . 
I &apos;m an expert in relationships . And 
then he goes and falls into more talk of rare birds and algae and weird and aquatic plants , 
and you know , don &apos;t get me wrong . &quot; This was really fascinating . You know , the biotic community , unplugged ? So , in the way 
it &apos;s great . But I was in love . 
And my head got weak over this boiled piece of delicious fish that I had on the eve . 
So I interrupted it . I said , Miguel . How is it that your fish tastes so good ? He 
pointed to algae . 
I know boy , the algae of phytoplankton , the relationships . That &apos;s incredible . 
But what do your fish eat ? 
How is the recycling of feed ? Well 
, he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eat what they eat in the wild would eat . 
The plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton . That &apos;s what the fish feed . 
The system is so healthy . It &apos;s completely self @-@ explanatory . 
There &apos;s no food . 
Ever from a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals . 
Later that day , I drove on this plot with Miguel . And I asked him . I said , &quot; For a place that seems so natural , unlike any farm on the farm I &apos;ve ever been . How do you measure success ? &quot; 
The moment it was like a film director was demanding a stage change . 
And we were bowing around the corner , and we had the most incredible sight : Thousands and thousands of pink flamingos . A literally pink carpet . As far as the eye can see . 
That &apos;s success . He said . 
&quot; Look at their bellies . &quot; Pink . 
They &apos;re smuggling , smuggling 
. I was completely confused . 
I said Miguel . Don &apos;t mess your . Fish . Yes . 
He said , &quot; We &apos;re losing 
20 percent of our fish . And fish eggs to the birds . 
&quot; Now , last year , 600,000 people were more than 250,000 birds on this site . 
It &apos;s the biggest one today . And one of the most important private bird reserves in Europe . 
I said , &quot; Miguel is a good thing . Fourishing bird population , not . The last one you have to have on a fish rearing . &quot; 
He shook his head . No . 
He said , &quot; We &apos;re building extensively , not intensively . 
This is an ecological network . 
The flamingos eat the shrimps , 
the shrimps eat the phytoplankton . 
So the closer the belly , the better the system . &quot; 
Okay . Let &apos;s think about this . A farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals . And a farm that can succeed in the health of its predators , 
a fish rearing , but also a bird reserve . 
Oh , and by the way , these flamingos shouldn &apos;t even be there from the outset . 
They breed 240 kilometers away in a city where soil quality is better . For nest maintenance 
every morning , they fly 240 kilometers to the farm , 
and every night they fly . They fly 240 kilometers back . 
They do that because they &apos;re on the beaten white line of the A92 highway . 
Seriously . 
I had a kind of trip of penguins . So I looked at Miguel . 
I said Miguel . Fly 240 kilometers to the farm and fly them . Then 240 kilometers back . In the 
evening , they do that for the kids . He 
looked at me as if I had just heard a song by Whitney Houston . 
He said , &quot; No . &quot; They do that because the food is better . 
I don &apos;t have the skin of my beloved fish mentioned . It was delicious , and I don &apos;t like the skin of fish . I don &apos;t like it sucked . I don &apos;t like it crispy . 
It &apos;s this biting , charred taste . 
I almost never cook with it . And 
yet , when I put it in this restaurant in southern Spain , it didn &apos;t look like the skin of fish at all . 
It tasted sweet and pure as if you were eating a bite from the ocean . 
I mentioned that to Miguel . And he nodded . 
He said , &quot; The skin looks like a sponge . 
It &apos;s the last defense before anything in the body enters . 
&quot; She &apos;s been evolving over the course of evolution to suck up impurities . And 
then he added , &quot; But our water has no impurities . Okay 
. A farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish . A farm that measures its success in the success of its predators . 
&quot; And then I realized when he said , &quot; A farm that doesn &apos;t have impurities , it undermines enormously . &quot; Because the water that flows through this farm comes from the Guadalquivir River . 
It &apos;s a river that connects all these things with all the rivers that are now prone to it , with them , to lead . Chemical pollutants : Outflow of pesticides . 
And if it goes through the system and this one leaves , it &apos;s cleaner than the water it came in , and it &apos;s cleaner than it has come in . 
The system is so healthy . It purifies the water 
, not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals . Not only a farm that is successful in the health of its predators , but a farm that literally is a water treatment plant . And not only for these fish , but also for you and me . 
Because when the water flows out , it sinks into the Atlantic , 
a drop in the ocean . I know , but I take it . And you should do that . Because this love story , however romantic , is also instructive . 
You might say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food . Whether we &apos;re talking about meat or perch , 
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , of one where food is . In fact , it tastes good . 
But for many people , it &apos;s a little too radical . 
We &apos;re not realists . We enjoy . We &apos;re lovers . 
We love weekly markets . We love small family businesses . We talk about regional food . We eat organic food . 
And if you claim that these are the things that are the future of good food . Does anybody stand up somewhere and say , &quot; Hey guys , I love pink flamingos . &quot; But how are you going to feed the world ? How 
are you going to feed the world ? 
Can I be honest . 
I like this question . Not . 
No . Not because we &apos;re already producing enough calories to feed the world more than just feed the world . 
A billion people will starve today . 
A billion . That &apos;s more than ever before . Because of stark inequalities in distribution , not total production . 
Well , I don &apos;t like this question because it &apos;s the logic of our food system that has been going on for the last 50 years . 
Feed grain to vegetable eaters , pesticides to monocultures , chemicals to the Earth , chicken to fish . And all the time , the agricultural industry has just asked . If we feed more people cheaper , how horrible can that be ? That 
was the reason . It was the justification . It was the business plan of American agriculture . 
We should call it what it is . A business in liquidation . A business that quickly takes up ecological capital , which allows that very production . 
That &apos;s not a business . And it &apos;s not agriculture . 
Our grain chamber is now threatened , not because of decreasing supply , but because of decreasing resources , 
not by the latest Moravian and Tractor inventions , but by fertile land , not by pumps , but by fresh water , not by chainsaws , but by forests , not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea . They 
want to feed the world . 
Let &apos;s start with the question . How are we going to feed ourselves , 
or better ? How can we create conditions that enable each community to feed itself ? 
To do that . Don &apos;t look at the agricultural industrial model for the future . 
It &apos;s really old . And it &apos;s done : 
Capital , chemistry and machines are at the top of it . And it never has anything really good to eat . 
Instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model . 
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve had two billion years of work experience . 
Look at Miguel . Farmers like Miguel . 
Farmers who don &apos;t have worlds . For themselves , farms are . Restore them . Instead of using farms . They grow extensively . Instead of just intensive farmers who are not just producers , but experts in relationships . 
Because they are the ones who are experts on taste . 
And if I &apos;m really honest , they &apos;re a better cook . When I ever will be , 
you know , I &apos;m right . Because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious . 
Thank you . 
I grew up with a lot of science fiction 
in my school days , and I was driving to school by bus . Every day , one hour per way . And my 
nose was always in a book , a science fiction book . That &apos;s what kidnapped my thoughts into other worlds and narratives my deep inside me . Unspeakable curiosity satisfied . 
This curiosity was also shown by the fact that whenever I &apos;m not in school , I was always strolling through the woods , wandering and sampling , collecting frogs and snakes and beetles and pond water , bringing everything home . And under the microscope , 
I looked at — was totally . Science enthusiasts . 
You know , it was always about trying to try and understand the world and the limits of what could be done . 
And my love of science fiction seemed to be reflected in my environment . Because back in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and we explored the deep sea , 
Jacques . Cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating shows , which brought us animals and places and a world full of wonders that we never had before imagined . 
So that &apos;s probably very good for that science fiction role . 
And I was an artist . 
I could draw . I could paint , 
and because it &apos;s neither video games nor this saturation with computer @-@ generated films , nor the whole visual language in the media landscape , I had to create the images in my head . 
We all had to do that at the time . If we as children read a book , we took the author &apos;s description and projected it onto the canvas in our heads . 
My reaction to that was drawing and painting aliens alien worlds , robots , spacecraft and all of that in math classes , 
I was constantly taught by the teacher , like I was hiding behind the textbook . 
So , around , creativity had to sort of get out of it . 
And something interesting happened . Because what happened to me about Jacques Cousteaus &apos; shows was the idea of a world that we knew completely unknowingly . Here on our planet , 
I &apos;m sure I would never have an alien world with a spaceship . That seemed pretty unlikely to me . 
But here was a world that I could actually enter . Here on Earth . And it was just as fascinating and exotic . Like all of this . What I &apos;d always imagined when I was reading these books . 
So when I was 15 , I decided to become a diver . 
The only problem with this was that I was in a small village in Canada , 1,000 kilometers from the next ocean . 
I was not discouraged by this . 
I was annoying my father until he finally had a diving school in Buffalo , New York , right on the other side of the border , where we lived . 
I made my diving certificate in a pool of YMCA in the middle of winter in Buffalo , New York , 
the ocean . But I got a real ocean . Only two years later , when we went to California , 
since we moved to California in the 40 years that have passed , I &apos;ve had about 3,000 hours underwater , and I &apos;ve been living in the ocean for a few years . 500 hours of that in submersible boats . 
And I &apos;ve learned that the deep sea world itself is in the flatter oceans , so rich in fascinating life as we are in the really scarcely imagined world . 
Nature &apos;s imagination knows no boundaries . Unlike our own miserable human imagination , 
until our present day , it &apos;s felt . I &apos;m deeply awe for what I do on my dives . 
And my love of the ocean continues to be as intense as ever . 
And ever as I grew up as an adult , it was that filmmaking . 
That seemed the best way to make my inner urge to tell stories . With my need to create images , 
to unite . As a child , I kept drawing comic books . And so on . 
So films were the way to bring images and stories together . That fit together . 
Of course , the stories I chose were from the science fiction field : Terminator , Aliens and Abyss . At 
Abyss , I could have my preference for the underwater world . And diving with filmmaking . 
So my two passions sort of intertwined . 
Something interesting happened at Abyss to create a narrative problem . In this movie , to solve , and we had to do this , we had to create a kind of liquid water system , we attacked computer @-@ generated animation . CG : 
What came out of this was . The first computer @-@ generated soft surface figure ever to be seen in a movie . 
The film didn &apos;t bring money . In fact , it just played its production costs . But I noticed something fascinating : The audience around the world was hypnotized by the magic of the magic that 
came out of it . Arthur Clarke &apos;s law says , as you know , advanced technology and magic are . Not to distinguish between them anymore . 
So you saw something magical . 
And I found that incredibly exciting . 
And I thought , wow . It &apos;s absolutely essential to integrate that into the film world . So 
we went to Terminator 2 , my next movie , a lot further . 
Together with ILM , we created the guy there from liquid metal . The success was very much dependent on how this effect would arrive . 
And it worked . Again , we had created something magical . And the effect in the audience was the same . But we did have a little bit more money with the film . 
Recorded by these two experiences , a whole new world had been achieved . A whole new world of creativity for filmmakers . 
So I started a company with my good friend Stan Winston , who was at that time the best make @-@ up and creature designer , called Digital Domain . 
The basic idea of this company was to start the phase of analog processes with optical printers , etc . , and to start digital productions in a moment . 
And we did that , and we did it . For a while , we had a competitive advantage . 
But in the mid @-@ 1990s , we realized that we were in the Creature and Character Design , which we actually founded the company for , too 
slowly . I had written this piece of Avatar , which is the benchmark for visual effects and computer @-@ generated effects , pushing the bar to new heights , with realistic human expressive characters made using CG . And the main characters should be all CG , and the world should be CG . 
But the benchmark pretty much pushed back . And the people in my company told me that for the time being , we &apos;re not yet able to do that . 
So I shifted that , and I made this other movie about the big ship . 
This goes down to the studio , I have that as Romeo and Juliet sold it on a ship . It became a love movie of epic proportions . A passionate movie , secret 
. But did I actually want to be a real wreck ? The Titanic : Dive 
down . That &apos;s why I made the film . 
That &apos;s the truth . The studio didn &apos;t know that . I convinced them , 
but I convinced them by saying , &quot; We dive to the wreck . &quot; We film the real wreck . 
We will do it in the opening sequence of the film . 
That &apos;s incredibly important . It &apos;s a good marketing tag . And 
I persuaded them to fund an expedition . 
Sounds crazy . But that &apos;s back to the fact that your imagination creates a reality . 
We actually created a reality six months later , where I got into a Russian dive boat , four kilometers below sea level , four kilometers below the North Atlantic , and I got the real Titanic through a bullet . This was 
not a movie . No HD . This was real . 
So this really blew me around . 
And the preparations for this were enormous . We had to have cameras and headlights and everything . 
And I noticed how much these deep @-@ sea dive gears resembled a space mission . 
Well , they were also high @-@ tech and needed extensive planning . 
You go up into this capsule , and you float into this dark , hostile environment where there is no hope of salvation . If you don &apos;t get it back yourself , 
and I thought , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s the same as if I were in a science fiction movie . 
&quot; That &apos;s really cool . I 
was really obsessed with exploring the deep sea . 
Anyway , from the part that &apos;s been related to curiosity and science . It was all . It was adventure . It was curiosity . It was imagination . 
And it was an experience that Hollywood didn &apos;t give me . 
Because , you know , I could imagine a creature for which we would then create a visual effect . But I couldn &apos;t imagine what I could imagine outside the window , 
right ? Some of the expeditions that followed , I saw beings in thermal springs . And sometimes things I &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things like things that still nobody has ever seen before . And for those who science was at the time we saw them , there were no 
words to find . So that really turned me around . And I wanted more . 
And so I met a slightly unusual decision 
after success of the Titanic , and I said , &quot; Okay . I want to be my main profession as a filmmaker in Hollywood on ice , and I &apos;m going to be a full @-@ time researcher for a while . &quot; 
And then we started planning these expeditions . 
We went to Bismarck and we explored them with robotic vehicles . 
We went back to the wreck of the Titanic . 
We took small robots that we had built , which were carrying out a fiberglass cable . 
Our intention was to dive in and get to see the inside of the ship , which had never been done before . 
Nobody had ever had ever explored the inside of the wreck . You had no means of doing that . So we developed the technology we needed . 
So , here &apos;s where I &apos;m sitting on the deck of the Titanic in a submersible boat , and I see planks that are quite similar to these boards here . And of those I know once the band was playing there . 
And I &apos;m flying through the deck with a little robot vehicle . 
I &apos;m actually just using it . But my consciousness is inside the vehicle . 
It felt like I was physically inside the ship wreck of the Titanic . 
That was the surreal form of a déjà vu I &apos;ve ever experienced . Because before I was bogging around a corner , I always knew what was going to happen in the light cone of the vehicle . Because I walked over the movie set for months when we shot the film . 
Because the set was an exact copy of the ship &apos;s blueprints . 
So that was a very strange experience . 
She made me realize this telepresence experience that you use robotic avatars like this . And so your consciousness into the vehicle , into this different form of existence , can be moved . 
It was really incredibly profound , 
and maybe a little bit of a view of what might be happening in a few decades . If you have cyborg bodies to explore something or other things to do . In all sorts of post @-@ human future scenarios that I can imagine as a science fiction fan . 
After these expeditions , we started what we saw down there . Really appreciate learning . For example , these deep sea equals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . These are , like , alien animals . But here on Earth . 
They live with chemosynthesis . 
They don &apos;t exist in a sunlight @-@ based system . How do we do that 
? And so you see animals right next to a 500 degrees Celsius water cloud . And 
you can &apos;t imagine they &apos;re surviving there . 
At the same time , I was also very interested in space science . This was the science fiction influence again . From my childhood , 
and so I ended up with the people who were interested in space and who were interested in NASA and who were involved in it . And sit on NASA &apos;s expert council and plan real space missions . They go to Russia , go through before the mission . The biomedical protocol , with all the drum and everything , then fly to the International Space Station and take our 3D camera systems . 
That was fascinating . 
But in the end , it was because I was a space scientist with us going into the deep sea . I took them 
and I gave them access to the world . Down there , astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme situations . I took them to the sources so they could look around , take samples and test instruments and so on . 
We did documentary films . But actually science , more specifically space science . 
So the circle between my existence as a science fiction fan , then as a child , closed . And the realization into reality . 
And as I went on this journey of discovery , I learned a lot . 
I learned a lot about science . But I also learned a lot about leadership . 
Now , you probably think a director must be able to be a leader , be a ship captain or something . But 
I didn &apos;t understand much about leadership . Before I started these expeditions , 
because at a certain point , I had to tell myself , what am I doing here ? 
Why am I doing this ? What &apos;s coming out of this ? These 
stupid movies don &apos;t bring us money . We &apos;re just playing 
the production costs , fame , no trace . 
Everybody thinks I &apos;m between Titanic and Avatar . I &apos;d run away and somewhere on a towel . Flamed on the beach . 
I &apos;ve all these movies , these documentary films , for a very small audience . 
No fame . No honor . No money . What are you doing ? 
You &apos;re doing it for the sake of the task , for the sake of the challenge , and the ocean is the most challenging environment that exists . You &apos;re doing it for the discovery . And because of the strange connection that emerges when a small group of people form a team . 
Because we have all of this at 10 to 12 people who have been working together for years and years . Sometimes we &apos;ve been two to three months in a row at sea . 
And in this community , you can see that the most important thing is respect that you have in front of each other because you &apos;ve done a job that you can &apos;t explain to anyone else . 
If you go back to land and say , &quot; We had to do it . &quot; The fiberglass , the sound attenuation , and all around it , all the technology and the difficulties . Human performance , if you work at sea , you can do it just by not explaining to others . This is like policemen or soldiers who do something in common , through . And you know they never can explain it to anybody . 
There &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect . 
So when I came back to my next movie , Avatar , I tried to apply the same leadership style , which is that you respect your team and in return deserve respect . 
And that really changed the dynamics . 
So I stood there again with a small team on unknown terrain . We turned Avatar with a new technology that it had not existed before . 
Exciting , exciting , 
a tremendous challenge . 
And we got ready for a four and a half @-@ year period to 
become a real family . And that changed my 
way of making films completely . There were people who thought we had these ocean properties really done well . And on planet Pandora . For 
me , it was more of a principled way of doing my job . The actual process , which has changed as a result . 
So what can we conclude from all of this ? 
What lessons have we learned ? 
I think the first thing is curiosity . 
It &apos;s the most powerful human property . Our 
imagination is a force that even creates a reality . 
And the respect for your team is more important than all the laurels of this world come 
to me . Boy filmmakers who say , &quot; Give me a advice on how I can do this . &quot; 
And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t limit you . &quot; Even one . That &apos;s what 
other people are worried about for you . Don &apos;t do it for you . Don &apos;t bet against yourself , but take risks , take risks . 
NASA has a favorite phrase like , &quot; Failure is not an alternative . &quot; 
But in art and in exploration , failure has to be an alternative . Because there it guarantees a trust advance , not 
an important undertaking , innovation . It was ever approached without risk . 
You have to be ready . Such risks have to be taken on . 
That &apos;s the idea I &apos;d like to share with you . Failure is an alternative . Fear . But is not one . Thank you . 
If I can bring you one thing closer today , it &apos;s that the whole data we consume is larger than the data we consume , the sum of their parts . And instead of thinking about overloading information , I want you to think about how we can use information in a way that creates patterns . And we see trends that otherwise are not visible . 
So what we see here is a typical death chart , arranged by age . 
The program I &apos;m using here is a little experiment . 
It &apos;s called Pivot . And what I can do with Pivot is I &apos;m going to go filter for a certain cause of death . Let &apos;s say accidents , 
and immediately I see another pattern that emerges . 
And that &apos;s because in the middle , here , people are most active . And over here , they are most frail . 
We can go one step further and sort the data out and then see that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everybody . Now , 
if we go on and sort by age , we say 40 years or younger . Let &apos;s see that accidents are even the main cause that people worry about , and they should be . 
And if you look at other things , you see that this is particularly true for men . 
So you see that the image of information and data in this way is very much swimming . In a vivid information graph , it &apos;s reminiscent . 
And if we do this for raw data , why not content itself ? 
So what we have here are the front images . Each and every one of the Sports Illustrated people who have ever been printed . 
It &apos;s all here . It &apos;s all online . 
You can like it after I gave my talk in your rooms . 
With Pivot , you can dive into a decade . 
You can dive into a given year . 
You can dive directly to a particular issue . 
Now , if I look here , I see the athletes who are out in this issue and the sports . 
I &apos;m a Lance Armstrong fan . So I click here , which makes all the issues that Lance Armstrong mentions to me . 
Now , if I get just a bigger overview , I might think , OK ? What ? If I could get all about cycling , 
so I go to a step back and expand the view . 
Now I see Greg Lemon . 
And so you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , more targeted , wider , more pure , zoom out . Then you don &apos;t look or surf . Not just . 
You do something that &apos;s actually a little different . 
It &apos;s something in between . And we think it changes the way that information is used , and it changes the way that information is used . 
I want to take this idea a little bit further , with something like , what &apos;s a little crazy ? 
What we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve got every single wikipedia page and put it on a little summary . 
The summary contains a short overview and a symbol for the range from which it comes . 
I &apos;m just going to show the top 500 of the most popular wikipedia pages . 
But even in this narrow view , we can do a lot of things . 
We get an instant impression of the issues that are most popular on Wikipedia . 
I &apos;m going to vote on the issue of government . 
Now , after I &apos;ve elected government , I realize that the categories of Wikipedia that are most covered by it -- Time Magazines -- are people of the year . 
This is really important . Because this is a realization that is not in a single Wikipedia page . 
This is only to be seen . If you go back a step and look at the whole thing , 
look at a particular one . I can then summarize these summaries into the theme of Time Magazines . People of the Year go in and see everybody together . 
Now , if I look at all these people , I realize that the majority of them are government officials . Some come from science . Some come even less from economics . Here &apos;s my boss . And one comes from music . 
And interestingly , Bono is also a TED Prize winner . 
So we can jump and take a look at all the TED Prize winners . 
You see , we surf the web . The first time it &apos;s really like it &apos;s a web , not just from side to side , but much more abstract . 
And so I want to show you something else , which is a little surprise . 
I &apos;m just going to show you the New York Times website . 
Pivot , this application . I don &apos;t want to call it a browser . It &apos;s really not a browser . But you can look at websites with it . And we bring this zoom technology to every single website like this . 
So I can take a step back and go directly to a specific section . 
That &apos;s important because you can only look at websites in a particular way and look at them all the way the Internet progresses in the same way , in the same way . 
So I can zoom in into my course , in a certain time frame . So 
here &apos;s the state of the whole demonstration that I &apos;ve kept going up to now . 
And I can sort of pull everything I &apos;ve seen so far . I can get back again . 
And if I go out a step and look at everything , I can refresh my course . Maybe after my search past . Here I &apos;ve been looking for nepotistic . Here &apos;s Bing , or here &apos;s Live Labs Pivot . 
And from here , I can go into the page and call it back . 
It &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again . And every time it makes the overall picture bigger than the sum of the data parts . 
Right now , in this world , we think data is a curse . 
We talk about the curse of the abundance of information . 
We talk about drowning in information . 
What if we could turn this situation around and turn the Internet upside down so that we , instead of always being from one to the other , start from many things to many things , go to many things ? And by doing that , we can see patterns that would otherwise have been hidden . 
If we can do this , then this data trap that we &apos;ve had so far may become a new source of meaningful information . 
And instead of just getting in information , you can . We know , get out of it . 
And if we know , we can even know wisdom , maybe . 
So I stop . Thank you very much . 
Everybody talks today about happiness . 
I have some people , the number of books that count with happiness in the title in the last five years , published . And they gave up after about 40 . And there were many more . 
There &apos;s a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers . 
There &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching . 
Everybody would like to make people happier . 
But despite all this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps that , in a way , make it almost impossible . Sure . Thinking about happiness 
and my talk today is mostly about these cognitive traps . 
That &apos;s true for laymen who are thinking about their own happiness . And it &apos;s true for scientists who are thinking about happiness because it turns out we &apos;re just as confused as anyone else . 
The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity . 
It turns out the word happiness is simply not a useful word anymore because we &apos;re doing it on too many different things , too . 
I think there &apos;s a certain meaning on which we could limit it . But by and large , this is something we &apos;re going to have to give up . And we &apos;re going to have to take the complicated view . What well @-@ being is 
the second . Trap is a confusion of experience and memory . Basically , it &apos;s between happiness . In his life and being happy about his life or happy with his life . 
And these are two very different concepts . And they &apos;re both thrown together in the notion of happiness . 
And the third is the concentration illusion . And that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we don &apos;t think about a fact . Well @-@ being affects without distorting its meaning . 
I mean , this is a real cognitive trap . 
There &apos;s just no way . It &apos;s getting right . 
Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example from someone who had a question and answer session . After one of my lectures , which reported a story , it was unclear . He said he &apos;d heard a symphony . And it was absolutely wonderful music . And at the very end of the recording , there was a terrible , creeping sound . 
And then he added , &quot; Really , quite emotionally . That &apos;s ruined the whole experience . 
But it didn &apos;t have 
what it had ruined . &quot; Were the memories of the experience ? 
He had had the experience . 
He had 20 minutes of wonderful music . 
They didn &apos;t count because he stayed with a memory . The memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he kept getting . 
What that really tells us is that we &apos;re talking about ourselves and about other people . In the sense of two kinds of self . 
There &apos;s a self that is alive in the present . And the present knows is capable of rebuilding the past . But basically , only the present has 
it . It &apos;s the living self that the doctor instigates . You know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Is it hurting now ? &quot; If I touch you here . And 
then there &apos;s a remembering self . And the remembering self is that that &apos;s what mitzählt and the story of our lives keeps up . And it &apos;s the doctor &apos;s addressing by touching the question by asking the question . How did you feel lately ? Or 
how was your journey to Albania or something like that ? 
These are two very different units . The living self . And the remembering self . And confusing the two is part of the coexistence of the term happiness . 
Now , the remembering self is a storyteller . 
And that really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memories . It starts immediately . 
We &apos;re not just telling stories . If we make ourselves tell stories , 
our memory tells us stories . That means what we keep from our experiences is a story . 
And let &apos;s just start with an example . 
There &apos;s an old study . 
These are real patients who are going to undergo a painful procedure . 
I &apos;m not going to go into detail . It &apos;s no longer painful today . But it was painful when this study was done in the 1990s . 
They were asked to do their pain every 60 seconds . And 
here are two patients . These are their records . 
And they &apos;re asked , who of both suffered more ? And 
this is a very simple question . 
Patient B has suffered more clearly . His intestinal reflection was longer and every minute of pain . Patient A had patient B and more . 
But now there &apos;s another question : How much did these patients think they suffered ? And 
here &apos;s a surprise . And 
the surprise is that patient A has a much worse memory of intestinal reflection than patient B. Patient B. has had 
the stories of intestinal reflections differently . And because a very critical part of the story is how it ends . 
And none of these stories is very edible or great . But one of them is clear . But one of them is significantly worse than the other , 
and the one that is worse was where the pain was all at the end of its peak . It &apos;s a bad story . 
How do we know that ? 
Because we &apos;re going to ask these people about their gut reflection , and much later on , how bad was the whole thing ? And 
it was much worse for A than for B in memory . 
Well , this is a direct conflict between the living self and the remembering self , 
from the perspective of the living self , B clearly had a worse time . 
Now , what you could do with patient A ? And we actually did clinical experiments . And it was done . And it works . You could actually do the protracted intestinal reflection of patient A by just putting the tube inside without being too much attached to it . And 
that will make the patient suffer . But just a little bit less than before . 
And if you do that for a few minutes , you &apos;ve made the living self of the patient A worse off than that . And you &apos;ve made the remembering self of patient A much better off than that . Because now you have patient A better story about your experience . 
What does a story look like ? 
And that &apos;s true of the stories that memory gives us . And it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent , which 
makes a story unique . Breaks , significant moments and ends . 
Ends are very , very important . And in this case , the end dominated . 
Now , the living self is constantly living its life . 
It has moments of experience one after the other . 
And you ask , what happens to these moments ? 
And the answer is really simple . They &apos;re lost forever . 
I mean , most moments of our lives . And I &apos;ve calculated that . You know , the psychological present is considered for about three seconds . What does it mean ? Do you know that in a life there are about 600 million of them ? In a month , there are about 600,000 . Most of them leave no trace . 
Most of them are completely ignored by the memory self . 
And yet , somehow they get the impression that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience . Our life is , 
it &apos;s the limited resource we consume while we &apos;re in this world . 
And how we consume it would seem important . But that &apos;s not the story that the memory self keeps for us . 
So we have the memory self . And the living self . And they &apos;re really quite different . 
The biggest difference between them is how to deal with time . 
From the perspective of the living . Even if you have a vacation and have the second week just as good as the first one . Then the two @-@ week holiday is twice as good as the one @-@ week holiday . 
That &apos;s not how it works at all . For the remembering self , 
for the remembering self , a two @-@ week holiday is hardly better than the one @-@ week holiday . Because there are no new memories added . 
You don &apos;t change the story . 
And that &apos;s how time is actually the critical variable that a remembering self distinguishes from a living self , and time has . Very little influence on that story . 
Now , the remembering self makes more than remembering and telling stories . 
It &apos;s actually the one . It makes decisions , because if you have a patient who , let &apos;s say , has two intestinal reflections with two different surgeons , and decides which one to choose . Then the one who chooses is the one who has the memory that &apos;s less bad . And that &apos;s the surgeon who will be selected . 
The living self has no voice . In this election , actually , 
we don &apos;t choose between experiences . We choose between memories of experiences . 
And even if we think about the future , we think about our future , usually not as experiences . 
We think about our future as anticipated memories . 
And basically , you can look at that . You know , as a tyranny of the memory self . And you can look at the memory self as one . That , so to speak . The living self is dragging through experiences that the living self doesn &apos;t need . 
I have the impression that if we go on vacation , that &apos;s very often the case . That means we go on vacation as far as possible in the service of the memory self . 
And that &apos;s a little hard to justify , I think . 
I mean , how much do we feed from our memories ? 
That &apos;s one of the explanations that is for the dominance of the memory self . 
And when I think about that , I think about a vacation that we spent a few years ago in Antarctica , which is clearly the best vacation we &apos;ve ever had in Antarctica that I &apos;ve ever had . And I think about it relatively often relative to how often I think about other vacations . 
And I probably have from my memories of this three @-@ week journey . I would say for about 25 minutes in the last four years . 
Drilled . Well , if I &apos;d ever opened the folder with the 600 images in it , I would have spent another hour . 
Now , that &apos;s three weeks . And that &apos;s at most . One and a half hours . 
It seems to be a disagreement . 
Well , I like to be a little extreme . You know , in it , how little appetite I have for feeding memories ? But even if you do more of that , there &apos;s a real question . Why do we give memories so much weight in the scourge to the weight that we give experiences ? 
So I want you to think about a thought experiment . 
Imagine your next vacation . You know that at the end of your vacation , all your pictures are destroyed . And you get an amnesty drug so you get nothing to remember , you don &apos;t remember . 
Now , would you choose the same vacation ? And if you choose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species of vacation : Self . And you have to think about how you decide this conflict . And that &apos;s really not obvious at all . Because if you want to think about time , you get an answer . And if you want to think about memories , you could get a different answer . 
Why choose the vacations that we choose is a problem that is facing us , with a choice between the two , the two types of self . 
Now , the two kinds of self throw two terms of happiness . 
There are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply : One per self . 
So you can ask , how happy is it ? The living self . 
And then you would ask , how happy are the moments in the life of the living self ? 
And you &apos;re all lucky for moments . Is a fairly complicated process . 
What are the emotions ? They can be measured . 
And by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea . Of the happiness of the living self over time . 
If you look at the happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a very different thing . 
This is not about how happy a person lives . 
It &apos;s about how satisfied or happy . The person is when that person is thinking about his life , 
very different terms . 
Anyone who doesn &apos;t differentiate these terms is going to . Exploring happiness is going to melt . And I &apos;m a lot of researchers about well @-@ being , who are long masking the exploration of happiness . And in that very way , 
the distinction between the happiness of the living self . And the happiness of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years . And now you &apos;re trying to separate the two . 
The Gallup Organization has a global survey , where more than half a million people have asked questions . What they know about their lives and their experiences ? And there have been other efforts in the direction . 
In recent years , we &apos;ve started to think about the happiness of the two kinds of self . 
And the main lesson we &apos;ve learned , I think , is that they &apos;re really different . 
You can know how satisfied someone with their lives is . And that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happy he lives his life . And vice versa , 
just to give you an idea of the correlation . The correlation is about five percent 
, which means that if you meet someone and you hit someone , you would tell them , &quot; Oh , his father is a two @-@ meter man . &quot; How much would you know about his height ? 
Well , you would know about his size . But there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty . 
You have so much uncertainty . 
If I tell you that someone has his life as eight on a scale of 10 , you know . Do you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self ? 
So the correlation is low . 
We know something about what happiness self happiness determines . 
We know money is very important . Targets are very important . 
We know happiness means happiness is primarily about being satisfied with people we like , spending time with people who we love , and people who we like . 
There &apos;s other pleasure . But that &apos;s dominant . 
So if you &apos;re lucky about the two kinds of self , you want to maximize it . You &apos;re going to end up doing very different things . So 
the conclusion from what I said here is that we &apos;re lucky , really not imagining , when we &apos;re replacing happiness with well @-@ being . 
It &apos;s a completely different term . 
Now , very briefly , another reason why we don &apos;t know how to think about happiness is that we don &apos;t think about the same things . When we think about life , and when we actually live . 
So if you ask the simple question of how happy people in California are , they &apos;re not going to get the right answer . 
If you ask that question , do you think that people in California need to be happier ? If you say , &quot; We live in Ohio , &quot; 
and what happens is that if you talk about life in California , think about the difference between California and others , you know ? And that difference is , say , climate . 
Well , it turns out climate isn &apos;t very important to the living self . And it &apos;s not even very important for the thoughtful self . That decides how happy people are , 
but now , because the thoughtful self is responsible . Can you end up with some people , at the end , moving to California ? 
And it &apos;s kind of interesting to track . What happens to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier ? 
Well , their living self won &apos;t get happier . 
We know that . 
But one thing will happen . You &apos;ll think you &apos;re happier . Because if you think about that , you &apos;ll be reminded of how terrible the weather in Ohio was . And you &apos;ll feel you &apos;re making the right decision . 
It &apos;s very difficult to think clearly about well @-@ being . And I hope I have an impression of how difficult it is to think about it . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question for you . 
Thank you very much . 
Well , when we telephoned a couple of weeks ago , you told me that it was a pretty interesting result that came out of this Gallup survey , and 
is that something that you &apos;re going to be able to share with us because you &apos;re now left with a few minutes ? 
Daniel Kahneman : Sure . 
I think the most interesting result we have in the Gallup survey is a number that we have absolutely no idea what to find . 
We found that in terms of happiness for the survivor . 
Even if we looked at how feelings with income vary , 
and it turns out that it turns out that under an income of 60,000 dollars in a year for Americans . And that &apos;s a very big sample of Americans . About 600,000 . But it &apos;s a big representative sample . Under an income of 600,000 dollars a year . 
About 60,000 . 
DK : 60,000 , 
60,000 dollars . In the year , people are unhappy . And they &apos;re getting increasingly unhappy . The poorer they get 
, we get an absolutely flat line about it . 
I mean , I rarely saw such flat lines . 
What happens is , obviously , money doesn &apos;t get you experience happiness . But that lack of money certainly gives you misery . And we can get this misery very , very clear . 
In the sense of the other , even the remembering self , you get a different story . 
The more money you make , the more satisfied you are . 
That &apos;s not true of emotions . 
CA : But Danny , throughout America , this is about life . Freedom , the quest for happiness . 
When people take this finding seriously , I mean . It all seems to turn on the head . Everything we believe , for example , in tax policy and so on , 
there &apos;s an opportunity that politicians , that the country in general , has a finding like Ernst , would take . And based on that , politics would do 
DK , you know ? I think there &apos;s recognition for the role of gambling research in politics . 
Recognition will be slow . In the United States , no question . But in the United Kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now . And in other countries , it &apos;s happening right now . 
People are recognizing that they &apos;re lucky thinking about happiness . If you think about politics , 
it &apos;s going to take a while . And people will discuss whether to explore experience happiness , or whether to explore life assessment . So we have to have this discussion pretty soon , 
how to increase happiness . It &apos;s very different . Depending on that . How you think ? And whether you think about the memory self , or whether you think about the living self . 
That &apos;s going to influence politics , I think in the coming years 
in the United States . If you tighten yourself to the happiness of the people of 
experience . That , I think , will be in the next decade or two part of national statistics . 
CA : Well , it seems to me that this topic is , or should at least be , the most interesting political debate to follow . Over the next few years . 
Thank you very much . For the invention of behavioral economics . 
Thank you . Danny Kahneman : Today 
I &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate . 
And that might surprise you a little bit , because my full @-@ time work at the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds , about the things we need to invent and deliver , about the poorest two billion to make a better life possible . 
But energy and climate are extremely important . For these people , in fact , even more important than for any other on the planet . 
Climate degradation means that their seeds will not grow for many years , we will be too much or too little rain . Things will change as they change their fragile environment , which will not be sustainable . 
This leads to starvation . It leads to insecurity . It leads to unrest . 
So climate change is going to be terrible for you . And 
also , the energy price is very important for you . 
The fact is , if you &apos;re talking about just one thing , you could reduce the price , to reduce poverty , energy . By far the most effective thing : 
Well , the energy price has fallen over time . 
In fact , the progress society is based on energy progress . 
Coal evolution drove the industrial revolution . And even in the 20th century , there was a rapid fall in the electricity price . And so we have refrigerators , air conditioning . We can make modern materials . And we do so many things , 
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world . 
But if we let the price down , we let the price halve . Let &apos;s hit a new barrier . And this barrier is related to CO2 . 
CO2 warms the planet and the equation for CO2 is . Actually , pretty clear . 
They sum up . The CO2 emitted , which leads to temperature increase . And this temperature increase has some very negative effects on the weather . And maybe worse , the indirect consequence is that natural ecosystems are undergoing such rapid changes that they cannot adapt . And so whole systems collapse . 
Now , the exact link between a CO2 increase and the resulting temperature change , and where its further consequences lie . There are some ambiguities , but not very many . 
And there &apos;s certainly uncertainty about how bad these consequences will be . But they will be extremely bad . 
I &apos;ve asked the top scientists several times , &quot; Do we really have to get down to near zero ? 
&quot; &quot; Is not half or a quarter enough ? 
&quot; The answer is , until we get near zero . Will the temperature continue to rise ? 
So it &apos;s a big challenge . 
It &apos;s quite different from saying . We have a three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ foot truck that &apos;s under a three @-@ meter bridge . It &apos;s got to come here , and you can sort of squeeze it down below 
. This has to be down to zero . 
Well , we run a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons . 
Every American , about 20 tons of people from poor countries , less than one on average , 
it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet . 
And somehow we have to create changes that reduce that to zero . 
It &apos;s been constantly increasing . 
Only different economic changes have affected it at all . And we have to move from rapid growth to reduction and to a reduction to zero . 
This equation has four factors : A bit of multiplication . You have this thing on the left , CO2 , that you want to get to zero . And that &apos;s going to depend on the number of people , on the services that every human being uses on average , the average energy for every service , and the CO2 per unit of energy . 
It &apos;s emitted . So let &apos;s emit each factor individually . And let &apos;s think about how we get that to zero . 
Probably one of these numbers has to be very close to . 
Zero . Now , this is basic algebra . But let &apos;s go through it . 
First of all , we have the population . 
Today , 6.8 billion people live 
, and it &apos;s going to reach 9 billion , 
which is going to move to 9 billion . If we succeed very successfully with new vaccines , healthcare and reproductive medicine . Could we possibly do that by 10 to 15 percent ? But right now , we &apos;re seeing a 1.3 percent rise . 
The second factor is the services we use . 
That includes all the food we eat : Clothing , television , heating . 
These are very good things . And poverty reduction means these services to almost everyone on the planet . 
It &apos;s great that this number is rising 
in the rich world , in the top billion , we might be able to make cuts and use less . But on average , this number is going to rise every year , and so it &apos;s more than doubling overall . The number of services per person that are provided . 
Here &apos;s a very basic service . Is there light at home to do the homework ? 
And these students don &apos;t have it . So they go out and read their homework under the street light . 
Now , effectiveness , the E : The energy per service finally gives good news . 
We have something that doesn &apos;t go up . 
Because of various successes in the lighting sector , because of other types of cars , because of new methods in building houses . There are many services whose energy consumption can drastically reduce them , and they can be drastically reduced . 103.00 , 05.50,000 GT , 00.05.53.53 , 000 . 
Some services can be reduced by 90 % . Some individual services can be reduced by 90 % , others can be reduced . 
Like the production of fertilisers 105.00 , 05.56.000 GT , 00.05.05.000 GT , 58.000 or the production of air transport . Or air transport is the scope for improvement , much smaller 
overall . If we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a reduction of a factor 3 , or maybe even a factor 6 . 
But in the first three , we &apos;re now 26 billion to . Maybe the very best 13 billion tons . And that &apos;s just not enough . 
So let &apos;s look at the fourth factor . And this will be a key factor . That &apos;s the amount of CO2 per unit of energy . 
It &apos;s emitted . It &apos;s the question of whether you get that to zero . 
If you burn coal , no , 
if you burn natural gas , no , 
almost every method of producing electricity emits . Today , CO2 , except renewable energy and nuclear energy . 
So what we do at a global level is a new system to 
create . We need energy under . 
Now , if I use the term &quot; miracle , &quot; I don &apos;t mean the impossible , 
the microprocessor is . A miracle , the PC is a miracle , 
the Internet , and its services are a miracle . 
People here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles . 
Normally , there &apos;s no deadline for you to do a miracle by a certain date . 
Normally , you &apos;re just standing next to it . And some don &apos;t come to others . In 
this case , we have to give full gas . And a miracle in a very short time . 
Well , I wondered , how can I really do that ? 
Well , there &apos;s a natural illustration , a demonstration that shows the idea of people here . 
I remembered last year . When I brought mosquitos , and somehow people liked that . 
The idea really became tangible to them . You know , there are people who live with mosquitos 
, for energy fell . So this is me . 
I decided that releasing fireflies was my contribution this year to the environment here . 
So here are some natural fireflies . 
I &apos;ve been assured they &apos;re not biting . In fact , they &apos;re not even going to leave the glass . 
Well , there are all kinds of game solutions like this . But they &apos;re not all doing much . 
We need solutions , either one or more , that make an unimaginable scale and unimaginable reliability . And though there are many directions where people are looking for it , I really see only five , which are making these big demands . 
I have tides , geothermal fusion and biofuels out . 
These may be a moderate contribution . And if they do better than I expect , that would be great . But my key message here is that we are working on all of those five . And we can &apos;t give up on them because they intimidate us . Because everybody has significant problems . 
Let &apos;s first look at them . Burning fossil fuels , burning either coal or natural gas . 
What you have to do there may seem simple . But that &apos;s not it . You have to take all the CO2 that comes out of the chimney after you burn it . Liquid under pressure . And then store somewhere and hope that it stays there . 
There are some pilot projects that will do that at a 60 / 80 level . But it &apos;s getting to 100 , it &apos;s going to be very difficult . And reaching an agreement on storing CO2 will be a big deal , a challenge . But the biggest problem here is the question of storing time . 
Who &apos;s going to make sure ? 
Who can guarantee something ? What literally is many billion times bigger than any kind of waste you get from nuclear and other things you 
can imagine . That &apos;s a lot of volume . 
So this is a hard nut . 
Next , nuclear energy 
, which also has three major problems . The cost , especially in highly regulated countries , is high . The question of security , that you really feel that nothing can go wrong . Despite human collaboration , that the fuel is not used for weapons . 
And then what do you do ? With the waste . 
Because although it &apos;s not very big , there are a lot of concerns . 
People have to feel good about it . 
184,00 , 10 , 20,000 GT , 00 , 10 , 25,000 . So three very difficult problems that may be solvable , three very difficult problems that may be solvable . And so they should work on 
the last three of the five . So I &apos;ll summarize . 
It &apos;s renewable energy . As you &apos;re often called , 
and they also have , although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel . They have some disadvantages . 
One is the energy density that these technologies generate is dramatically lower than that of power plants . 
These are low @-@ energy energy . You talk about many square kilometers , thousands of times more space than a normal power plant . 
And these sources are also subject to interruptions . 
The sun doesn &apos;t shine all day long . Nor does it shine every day . And the wind doesn &apos;t blow all the time . 
So if you &apos;re talking about these sources , you have to have a way to use energy even in times . If it &apos;s not available to 
get it . So there are big price challenges here . There are challenges in transmission . For example , if we say that the energy source is outside the country , you don &apos;t just need technology . You also need to deal with the risk that the energy is coming from where it comes from . 
And there &apos;s the storage problem . 
And to show the dimension , I &apos;ve looked at all kinds of batteries that are made , which are used for cars , computers , cell phones , flashlights for everything . And I &apos;ve got that with the amount of electronic energy that the world uses . I found that all the batteries that we &apos;re now producing are less than 10 minutes of total energy storage . 
So we need a big breakthrough here , something that takes about a factor 100 will be better than the current approaches . 
That &apos;s not impossible . But it &apos;s not that easy . 
That &apos;s what happens when you try to tell these interrupted sources about . We consume 20 @-@ 30 percent of the consumption . 
If you get 100 percent of the consumption on that , you need an incredible wonder battery . 
Now , where are we going to go ? What &apos;s the right approach ? 
A Manhattan project . How do we get to the finish line ? 
What we need is a lot of companies working on it , hundreds of people . 
In each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people . 
In many , you &apos;ll say , &quot; They &apos;re crazy . &quot; That &apos;s good . 
I think here in the TED group , there are many who are already engaged . 
Bill Gross has several companies , including one called Esolar . The great solar thermal technologies have invested 
Vinod Khosla in dozens of companies . The great things are doing and have interesting opportunities . And I &apos;m trying to support that . 
Nathan Myhrvold and I are funding a company that , surprisingly , is perhaps pursuing the nuclear approach . 
There are some innovations in the nuclear field : Modular , liquid . 
Development has been very successful in this industry some time ago . So it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are lying around . 
The Terrapower concept means that instead of a part of the uranium , one percent , you have the U235 . We decided to burn the 99 . The U238 . This 
is a pretty crazy idea . But 
in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time . But you could never reasonably simulate whether it would work . But since there are modern supercomputers , you can simulate it and see that yes , with the right approach to materials , it looks like it works . 
And because you burn these 99 , the cost profile is much better . In fact , 
you burn the garbage , and you can even burn the garbage from today &apos;s reactors as 
a drive . Instead of turning your head apart , they just burn it . A great thing : 
Uranium is being used gradually , a little bit like a candle . 
You can see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often called a migratory wave , reactor . 
It really solves that . The fuel problem here 
is a picture of a place in Kentucky . 
That &apos;s the waste , the 99 percent . You have the part that &apos;s burned today . You have taken it out . So it &apos;s called depleted uranium . 
That drives U.S. for hundreds of years to come . 
And if you buy ocean water cheaply and simply filtered , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet &apos;s 
life . You know , there are many challenges there . But it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward , and we need to get there . 
So let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success 
. How should our testimony look ? 
Well , we go to the goal that we need to achieve . And then we talk about the intermediate step . 
Many talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 . 
It &apos;s really , really important that we get there , 
the remaining 20 percent is produced in poor countries , and still some agriculture . Hopefully , forest threats and cement will be clean by then . 
So to get to that 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like China , needs to completely transform their generation of electricity . 
The other note says , is we using zero emissions technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to that , to the rest ? 
That &apos;s super important . 
That &apos;s going to be a key element of this stuff . 
If we go back from there , how should that 2020 be testimony ? 
It should be back in the two elements . 
We should use the effectiveness measures to get reduction going . The less we emit , the lower the amount of CO2 will be . And so will the temperature . 
But actually , this note is for the things we do , the things that are not completely leading to the big reductions . Just equal or even a little less . Important , like the others , which are the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs . 
We need to track these breakthroughs with full @-@ gas . And we can measure that in company numbers , pilot projects and regulatory changes . 
There are many great books on this subject . 
The Al Gore book . We have the choice . And David McKay &apos;s Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air . They 
really go through it and create a framework in which this is widely discussed . Because we need support from all sides for this . 
There are a lot . The coming together has 
to be a wish . 
A very concrete wish that we invent this technology . 
If you just want me a wish for the next 50 years . I could choose the president , a vaccine , and I love that . Or I could choose that wish . That is halved energy price . Without CO2 , it &apos;s invented , that desire would be sewn . 
I , this one , has the greatest impact . 
If we don &apos;t get that wish , the gap between the long @-@ term and the short @-@ term will be thought . People will be terrible between the United States and China , between poor and rich countries , and almost all of the lives of these two billion will be . A lot worse . 
So what do we have to do ? 
What measures do I appeal for ? 
We have to work for more research funding . 
If countries are in places like Koppenhagen , they should not only be talking about CO2 . 
They should discuss this innovation strategy . And they would be shocked by the ridiculously low money that is being spent on these innovative approaches . 
We need market incentives , carbon taxes , cap &amp; amp ; trade , something that sends out a price signal . 
We need to spread the news . 
We need dialogue , rationalization and completeness , and also the things that the government is doing . 
It &apos;s an important wish . But I think we can fulfill it . 
Thank you very much . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . Thank you . 
Thank you . Thank you very much . Just to get a little better at understanding Terrapower . First of all , you can give us an idea of the magnitude of this investment . 
Bill Gates : To simulate on a supercomputer . To get all the big scientists what we &apos;ve done , we just need a few 10 million . And even if we put our materials in a Russian reactor to make sure it &apos;s reasonable to work . Is it only in the 100 million that you 
&apos;re tough ? Step is building the first reactor , another billion to find . The regulations and the place where they actually build the first one . 
Once the first one is finished , when it &apos;s running as promised , then it &apos;s all very clear . Because the economic viability , the energy density , is as different as nuclear energy as we know it . 
CA : To understand that correctly . That means deep into the ground . Almost like a vertical pillar of nuclear fuel . This consumed uranium . And then the process starts at the top and continues to work . Down . 
BG : Exactly . Today you always have to refill the reactor . So there are lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong , this thing where you open it and things in or out . That &apos;s not good . 
But if you have very cheap fuel , you can refill it for 60 years . Think of a column that you bury without the whole complexities . 
And it sits there and it burns for 60 years . And then it &apos;s done . 
CA : A nuclear reactor that itself is offering a solution to the garbage . 
BG : Yeah . Now , what happens to the garbage ? You can let it sit . There &apos;s much less garbage . So with this method , you take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it further . 
And we start by taking the garbage that already exists , which is in these refrigerators or dry containers at the reactors . That &apos;s our starting fuel . So what is 
that for these reactors was a problem ? What we do in our fill , and that &apos;s dramatically reducing the garbage volume . So during this process , 
about , but while you &apos;re talking to different people in the world about these possibilities . 
Where is the greatest interest ? So , to actually implement this . 
BG : Well , we haven &apos;t yet set ourselves in a place . And there &apos;s a lot of interesting disclosure rules for everything that nuclear carries in the name . There &apos;s a lot of interest , and the people of the company were in Russia , India , China . I was here and I met the energy minister and talked about how this fits into the energy agenda . 
I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the French and Japanese have something in the direction . 
This is a variant of one thing . It was done . 
This is an important step forward . But it &apos;s like a fast reactor . And some countries have built this . So anyone who &apos;s implemented a fast reactor is a candidate for our first one . 
CA : In your imagination , timeframe and probability , this is really how to bring this into being . 
BG : Well , we need one of these scalable , power generating things that is very cheap . We &apos;ve got 20 years to invent . And then 20 years to deploy . 
This is kind of the deadline that environmental models have shown us that we have to meet . 
And you know , Terrapower , if everything goes well . And this is a big one . Wish could keep this easy . 
And fortunately , there are dozens of companies today . And we need hundreds that are the same . If their approaches work , the promotion for their pilots works . Can offer them for that . 
And it would be best if several could do it , because then you could use a mix . In any case , 
we need a solution . 
CA : Concerning the big , possible breakthroughs , this is the biggest thing you know . 
BG : An energy break is the most important thing . 
It would be without the environmental challenge . But it &apos;s still doing that . More importantly , 
in the nuclear sector . Are there other innovative companies 
? You know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as they do . But there &apos;s the modular method . That &apos;s a different approach . 
There &apos;s a liquid reactor type that seems a little difficult . But maybe they say that about us . 
And so there are different ones . But the nice thing about this is that a uranium molecule is a million times as much energy as a coal molecule , let &apos;s say . And so if you deal with the problems and they &apos;re mostly the radiation of the footprint and the cost is playing this potential . So the impact on the country and other things , almost in a league of its own . 
CA : If that doesn &apos;t work , what 
do we have to do then is take emergency measures to try and keep the Earth temperature stable ? 
BG : If you get into this situation , it &apos;s as if you ate too much . And just before a heart attack , what do you do ? You might need a heart surgery or something like that . 
There &apos;s a research that &apos;s called geoengineering , which is based on different techniques to deal with the delay in warming , so that we can take 20 or 30 years longer to get together . 
This is just an insurance method . 
You hope we don &apos;t need that . 
Some people say you shouldn &apos;t be at insurance first because you have to maybe be lazy because you &apos;re going to eat , because you know you &apos;re going to have heart surgery rescuing you . 
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart . If you look at the importance of this problem . But there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering about whether to do that at your disposal . If things get faster or this innovation takes longer than we expect . 
CA : Climate skeptics , do you have one or two sentences for those to convince you ? 
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps . 
Those who make scientific arguments are very little , 
say it &apos;s negative effects that are associated with clouds . They move things . 
There are very , very few things they can even say about , one of which is a chance in a million . 
The main problem here is very much like AIDS . 
You make the mistake . Now , and you pay for it much later . 
And so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of urgent problems , investing in something that you &apos;re only going to have later on . And then the investment is not so clear . In fact , the IPCC Report is not necessarily . The worst scenario . And there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC and say , &quot; Okay . This is not a big drama . The 
fact is that this uncertainty is supposed to worry us . 
But my dream here is that if you make it economically and at the same time eliminate CO2 , then the people who are skeptical say . Okay . I &apos;m not interested in it emitting CO2 . I almost wish it did . But I &apos;m probably going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . CA 
: And that would be your answer to the Björn Lomborg argument that if you were to spend all this time and energy on the CO2 problem , you &apos;d have to solve it . All the other goals . These are the ones that are suffering from poverty reduction . The fight against malaria and so on , that it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources , money to invest , while it &apos;s better things , that we can do . 
BG : Well , the actual spending on research , let &apos;s say , the U.S. should spend 10 billion more per year than they do today . That &apos;s not so dramatic . Underneath 
it should be other things . 
Not suffering . You get to big amounts of money . And here , reasonable people can disagree . If you have something that &apos;s not economic and try to finance it . For me , most waste is happening here . 
Unless you &apos;re very close to a breakthrough in cost , you only fund the learning curve . I think we should try more things that have the potential , much cheaper to be . 
If the swab you get is a very high energy price . Then only the rich can keep up . 
I mean , each of us here could do five times as much for our energy without changing our lifestyle . For 
the bottom two billion , but is it a disaster ? And 
even Lomborg thinks about 
his new mesh . Now why isn &apos;t research being discussed anymore ? He 
&apos;s still being discussed because of his earlier stories with the skeptic camp . But he understood that this is a very lonely group . And so he &apos;s now bringing the research argument . 
And this is a thought that I think is appropriate : 
Research . It &apos;s just crazy , how little . It &apos;s supported by 
Bill . I think I speak for almost all the people here . When I say , &quot; I really hope that your wish will come true . &quot; Thank you very much . 
BG : Thank you . 
I &apos;d like to tell you something that I was told a few months ago when I wrote an article for Italian Wired . 
I &apos;ve always used to use my synonymous dictionary when writing . But I was busy editing the text . And I fell in love with the fact that I &apos;ve never been in my life . What really hampers the word ? I &apos;ll read you the entry &quot; disabled &quot; . 
&quot; Crippled &quot; adjective . 
&quot; Helpless , useless . &quot; &quot; Destroyed . &quot; &quot; Deathed , mutilated . &quot; &quot; Wounded , prepared , paralyzed , separated . &quot; &quot; Keep it away . &quot; Own , weakened , impotent , castrated , paralyzed . Gehandicapt.senil Poor age @-@ deprived , withdrawn , improved , done Poached , borrowed , counted ( see also : Injured , useless and weak ) 
@ antonyme @ healthy , strong @ efficient 
I have this list read out loud to a friend and I had to laugh first . It worked so ridiculous . But I just got ready and couldn &apos;t speak any more and had to stop reading and read and collect myself first . After this invincible flood of words and the emotional shock that it causes . 
Of course , this was a fractured old synonym dictionary . I just thought that the issue was pretty old , it had 
to be . But in fact , it was an issue in the early &apos; 80s . When I was just starting primary school , and that started my self @-@ image outside of my family environment , and started to form it , including in relation to other children and the rest of the world . 
Around me , thank God , I was not a synonym dictionary at the time , if 
I were to take this entry seriously . If I had been born into a world that someone like me perceived as a person whose lives were not in any way positive . But today I &apos;m going to be in favor of the opportunities and adventures I &apos;ve experienced . Famous . 
So I immediately went online to the 2009 edition and expected that I would be able to make a more appealing contribution here . 
Here &apos;s the updated version . This entry , 
unfortunately , is not much better . 
In particular , the last two words under Near Antonym shake me . All right and healthy . But 
it &apos;s not just about the words . 
It &apos;s about what we think about the people we think about with these words . 
It &apos;s about the values that are in those words , and how we construct those values . 
Our language influences our thinking , and how we influence the world and the people around us . 
Many ancient societies , including Greeks and Romans , really believed that the values of debate in a curse are a great force , because what we think is loud is that what we can manifest itself . 
So what do we want ? We actually manifest it . We have a disabled person . We have people or we have powerful people . We 
have people alone , we have to call a person careless as a child , we could be enough to limit them and to impose ideas on them . 
Would it not be more beautiful to open doors to them ? 
A person who opens doors to me was my pediatrician . AM A.I. DuPont Institute in Wilmington , Delaware . 
His name is Dr. Pizzutillo . An Italo @-@ American whose name , you can imagine . Most Americans don &apos;t have the right language . So he &apos;s always been called Dr. P. 
And Dr. P. always wore very colorful flies and was for work with kids , just like it was created . 
I found the time I was in this hospital , just great , except for my physiotherapy . 
I had to do some exercises , seemingly infinitely , with these thick elastic bands in different colors . You know that . To build my leg muscles . And I have hated these bands more than anything else . I hated them . I cursed them . I hated them . 
And imagine I &apos;ve even been in the age of five with Dr. P. negotiating with Dr. P. And so this is how to stop these exercises . Natural , without success . 
And one day he cursed me at one of my exercises . These exercises were just tiring and merciless . And he said to me , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young . Girl : You &apos;ll one day tear one of these tapes . 
And if you can do it , I &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot; 
That was , of course , just a simple trick by Dr. P. to do the exercises that I didn &apos;t want to do . With the prospect that the richest five @-@ year @-@ old girl in the hospital will be on the second floor . But he actually got me to do my daily exercise horror with new eyes . So it turned into a new and promising experience . 
And I wonder today how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful young boy . Girl shaped my self @-@ image , and I could imagine myself as one of nature &apos;s strong , powerful and atlethic people to see . 
This is just one example of many . How adults in power positions stimulate a child &apos;s 
imagination ? But like the examples from the synonymous dictionaries already cited , our language does not allow us any space to imagine something . What we all want would be for each and every one of us to be able to see themselves as powerful people . 
Our language lags behind the social changes that , in many cases , are triggered by technological change , from the medical point of view . 
From the perspective , of course , one can say that my legs , laser surgery for visually impaired visually impaired , knee joints made of titanium and artificial hip joints for aging bodies , which allow people to really use all their possibilities and to transcend the limits that their natural destiny has set them , not to speak at all . Social networking platforms : People are able to give themselves their own identity , give themselves in their own way , define themselves , 
and thus join groups around the world that they choose . So maybe 
this technological shift makes it clearer . Because ever since , it &apos;s always been a different truth , that every human being has something very special and very powerful to give to society , and that human ability to adapt . Our greatest plus is 
human ability to adapt . This is an interesting story . Because people keep asking me to tell me how to deal with adversity . And I &apos;ll confess something to you : This sentence has . Never fit for me , and I &apos;ve always been very uncomfortable with the questions people ask about it , and I &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable with it . And I think gradually I understand why . 
This sentence about dealing with adversity lives from the idea that success or happiness depends on it . Meeting a challenge without being affected by the experience that it entails . As if my life had been so successful , because I could have trapped a life with a prosthetic prosthesis . Or , whatever , people with my disability perceive me . 
But the truth is that we are changing . Of course , we are shaped by the challenge . Whether they &apos;re physical , emotional or even both . 
And I claim that &apos;s good . 
Adversity is not an obstacle that we need to curve to better understand with our lives . 
Adversity is simply part of our lives . 
And I tend to think of adversity as my shadow . 
Sometimes I realize it &apos;s very present . Sometimes it &apos;s hard to see , but it &apos;s always with me . 
And I don &apos;t want to mean the impact or severity of a human struggle to be reduced . 
There are adversity and challenges in life . And they &apos;re all too real . And every person is different about it . But the question is not whether we can get clear or not with adversity , but how we get clear about it . 
So we &apos;re not just responsible for that . The people we love to save from blows of fate , but also to prepare them for it . All right . So that &apos;s it . Let &apos;s get it right . 
And we &apos;re not doing our kids a favor . If we give them the feeling that they &apos;re not able to adapt . 
You have to do two things . All right . Separate . One is that the medical fact of being amputated . And the other is that I have a social opinion about whether I &apos;m disabled or not . 
And to be honest , the only real and permanent disability with which I &apos;m dealing is the only real and permanent disability that I have had to deal with is that the world is constantly saying . It can connect me with these definitions . 
In our desire to protect the people who care about us and to give them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis , or even a prognosis about quality of life , which they expect , they need to . We need to be careful not to lay the foundation for someone actually being disabled . 
Maybe the current concept is just a look at what &apos;s broken in a broken . And how we fix that for each individual , a greater disability than pathology itself . 
If we don &apos;t treat a person holistically and not all of his forces and possibilities . And we recognize , in addition to the natural struggle that you may need to fight . 
Another disease . We degrade a person who is responsible for our society . 
So we need to look beyond patology and look at all areas of human potential , 
and focus on this . But most importantly , it &apos;s that there &apos;s a gap between perception of our shortcomings and our great inventive spirit . 
We should connect these challenging times , not devalue or deny them . We should not try to avoid them . We should not try to sweep them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about opportunities in adversity . 
I might rather be interested in making it clear that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome adversity , but that we are open to embracing it . Put them in the head to take a fight expression and use a fight expression , and maybe even dance with it . 
And maybe we can do adversity as something natural , coherent and useful , and feel like that through their presence , not anymore , so burdened . 
This year , we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin . And when he was 150 years ago writing about evolution , Darwin wrote about evolution , in my view , has something very true in human character . 
I would rewrite it that way , not the strongest of its kind survives , nor does it survive the smartest of its kind , but the one that can best adapt to change . 
Conflict creates creativity , not only 
from Darwin &apos;s work . Do we know that human ability to survive and flourish from struggle of human mind ? It &apos;s determined to change through conflict . 
So again , change and adaptation are the greatest abilities of human beings . 
And maybe we know only from which wood . We &apos;re carved when we &apos;re really tested . 
Maybe that &apos;s the sense of adversity . A perception of ego , a sense of our own power . 
We can do something like that ourselves . 
We can give adversity a new meaning that goes beyond difficult times . 
Maybe we can see adversity as change . 
Adversity represents a change that we are still not adapting to . 
I think the greatest damage we do to ourselves is to make sure that we are normal , that we should be normal . 
Let &apos;s face it , who is normal ? 
There is no normal . 
There is the usual , the typical , but not the normal , and would you like this poor , gray person ? Really want to know if there were really ? 
I don &apos;t think it would be great . 
If we could counter this pattern of normality against another , the possibilities or the strength , to even a little more dangerous to put it . Could exchange . So we can exchange the forces of very many children . And invite them to release their very special and valuable skills into society . 
Anthropolgen has found that we humans are being led by the members of our society to always have one thing to do : To be useful and to contribute . 
There are indications that even Neanderthals are 60 000 years ago older people and people with human difficulty with physical injuries . They &apos;ve worn with them , and that may have happened because the life experience in these people &apos;s struggle for survival has been valuable to society . 
They don &apos;t break these people as broken and useless . They &apos;ve been seen as something special and valuable . 
A few years ago , I went to the city where I grew up in , to a food market . In that Red Zone in the northeast of Pennsylvania , and I stood in front of a cup of tomatoes . 
It was summer . And I had shorts , and 
I hear a guy . Behind me says , &quot; Well , if that &apos;s not Aimee Mullins , 
and I turn around and see this older man . &quot; I had no idea who he is . 
And I said , &quot; Excuse me . Sir , do we know ? &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t remember you . &quot; And 
he said , &quot; Well , you &apos;re not likely to remember me . &quot; When 
I first saw you , I first saw you out of the belly of your mother . &quot; 
Oh . So , the 
, and of course it did , but click . 
&quot; This was Dr. Kean . A man I just made from my mother &apos;s stories about this day because , of course , I was typical of my birthday , two weeks late 
, the doctor for prenatal diagnostics of my mother was in vacation . And so my parents knew the man who gave me birth at all . 
And because I was born without a calf &apos;s legs . And my feet were directed towards them , and I just had a few toes on this and a few toes . On the other foot , he was the handler . This stranger had to bring the bad news . 
He said to me , &quot; I had to tell your parents that you would never walk and never be so mobile . Like other kids , or you would never live an independent life . And since then , they &apos;ve just punished me with lies . Really 
? Exceptionally , I found that he &apos;s collected newspaper clips of my entire childhood . Whether I was competing for a letter in second grade , whether I was competing with the scouts at the parade , Halloween , traveling with the scouts , whether I was on my scholarship or one of my sporting victories , and he used these clips to get his students to teach . Medical students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School . 
And he called this part of his course the X factor , the potential of human will . 
You can &apos;t stress enough how crucial this factor is to quality of life for a human being . 
And Dr. Kean went on to tell us . He said , &quot; I learned that if children don &apos;t constantly say something else , they will . And even if they get a little bit of support , if you leave kids to themselves , then kids can achieve a lot . Look 
. Dr. Kean has changed his thinking . 
He understood that medical diagnosis and how someone can deal with it is 
two different things . And I too have my thinking over time changed . If you want to tell me at the age of 15 , if I had my prostheses against legs made of meat and bone , I would not have hesitated for a second . 
I absolutely wanted to be normal at the time . 
If you ask me that today , I &apos;m not so sure . 
And that &apos;s what happened because I have experienced something with my legs , not despite these experiences . 
And maybe that change could happen because I &apos;ve had so many people who have been meeting me open doors instead of opening people to me , who are restricting me or giving me an idea . 
See ? It really only takes a person to demonstrate to you . How you can manifest your forces . And you &apos;re through 
if you allow someone to make their own inner forces activated . The human mind is so receptive . If you can do that and for someone at a critical moment , open a door . Then you &apos;re a very good place to teach these people . 
You teach them to teach them to open doors to themselves . 
The real meaning of the word educate is rooted in the word educe . It 
means to create something that is in one : The potential to tickle out . Again 
, what potential do we want ? Because now , 
in the &apos; 60s , in Britain , a case study was done . Back then , high schools were 
transformed into schools . They call that streaming trials . In the United States , 
we call that tracking . Students are divided into grades . 
And the A students are being tested orally harder . The better teachers , etc . 
, they have students with high school capacity for three months , with a sufficiently good grade . They were told they were aces that they were very smart . And after those three months , they really wrote one . 
And of course , it breaks down to hear a heart , that the other way around , the one @-@ serer students were told . They were just enough . And 
the same way it was . After the three months , too . But only 
those who still in school were , apart from the students who were in school , who had thrown the school . 
And it was absolutely crucial . So in this study , the teachers were not inaugurated . 
The teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed . 
They were simply told that the Einser students were , and that the students with the grade are sufficient . And they also taught them something 
, and they treated the only real disability is a broken mind . A spirit that was broken has no hope anymore . It &apos;s not beautiful anymore , it &apos;s missing . Our natural , childish curiosity and our innate ability to imagination . But 
if we can do it , the human mind can help to continue to hope , to hope for itself and other people around it , to find themselves beautiful , curious and imaginative . Then we really put our forces in a positive position . 
One : If a mind has these qualities , we can create a new reality and new forms of existence . 
I want to end with a poem written by a Persian poet named Hafiz in the 14th century . And of which my friend Jacques Dembois told me , and the poem is called &quot; The God Who Words Only Four Words . &quot; Every child doesn &apos;t know God , the God of the Name . Not the God of Forbitions , but the God Who knows only four words . And this is repeated all the time . He only always says 
, &quot; Come dance with me . &quot; &quot; Come dance with me . Thank you very much . &quot;
