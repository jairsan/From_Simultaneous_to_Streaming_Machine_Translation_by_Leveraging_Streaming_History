Before a few years ago here at TED , Peter Skillman presented a design competition called &quot; The Marshmallow Challenge . 
&quot; The idea is pretty simple . Four teams have to get the widest possible freestanding structure with 20 spaghetti . CA : 1m tape . CA : 1m thread and a marshmallow build . 
The marshmallow has to go up on top . 
And though it really is easy , it &apos;s actually true , really hard . Because it &apos;s pushing people very fast to work together . 
And so , I thought this was a really interesting idea . And I have it in a way that I turned into a design workshop . 
It was a huge success . 
It &apos;s been a success since then , I &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world with students , developers and architects , even CTOs , the Fortune 50 companies . And there &apos;s something about this stuff to do . What depth of impressions into nature is about the collaboration . And I want to share some of these with you . 
Normally , the majority of people start themselves with regard to the task of orienting themselves . 
They talk about it . They think about how it will look . They &apos;re hanging around power . 
Then they invest in a little time in planning and organization . They sketch and lay down spaghetti out . 
They invest in a lot of their time in assembling , constantly growing structures . 
And finally , just before they don &apos;t have time anymore , somebody takes the Marshmallow and they put it gently , On the top , they take a step back and they admire TA @-@ da . 
What , then , almost always happens is that this TA @-@ da becomes an UH @-@ Oh , because the weight of the Marshmallow causes the whole thing to bend , and collapse . 
It &apos;s a series of people , and there are a lot more UH @-@ Oh moments than others , and among the worst , are freshest BWL graduates . 
They lie , they cheat . They &apos;re confused and they really produce very poor shapes . 
And of course , there are teams that have much more TA @-@ DA formations . And under the best are freshness among graduates of the kindergarten . 
And that &apos;s pretty amazing , 
like we &apos;re told by Peter . Produce them not only the highest levels of towers , but also the most interesting structures of all . 
What they might ask you is , how does this come about ? Why ? What is the point of those ? 
And Peter tells no one . The kids are investing time in it . Head of Spaghetti GmbH , right ? 
They &apos;re not investing time in power struggles . 
It &apos;s there , however , another reason , 
and that &apos;s because BWL students were trained , who had a real plan to find . OK ? 
And he was then realized . 
What then happens when they put the Marshmallow on the top of the line ? They have no time left . And what happens ? 
It &apos;s a crisis . 
Sounds familiar , what nursery 
kids do differently is that they do with the Marshmallow , they start prototypes , they build . Successful prototypes , always with the Marshmallow at the top , so that they have multiple times the opportunity to build dilapidated prototypes to repair . 
Constructors recognize these kinds of collaboration , as the core of an iterative process . 
And with each attempt , the attempt is made to get the kids immediately feedback , what works and what doesn &apos;t work . 
So this is the performance with prototypes to work with . So , essentially , but let &apos;s see how different teams operate . 
The average for the majority is that the average is about 50 centimeters . BWL students create . The half of them , lawyers , a little bit more , but not much kindergarten kids , are better than the adults . 
Who is at most successful architect 
and engineer ? To be 
lucky , 1m is the highest . What I saw I saw 
and why . Because they triangles understand . And self @-@ reinforcing geometric patterns are the keys to stable structures . 
CEOs are a little above average . But here &apos;s where it gets . 
Interesting is where you put an executive administrator . On the team , they become significant better . 
It &apos;s incredible . It &apos;s incredible . You look around and you see . This team is going to win . You 
can do that prediction . Why is this going ? 
Because you have special skills in process monitoring . 
You run the process . You understand it and that team , you know . 
That &apos;s what regulates it and how it works , and the performance of the team will significantly improve . 
Specialized skills and process skills and their combination will lead to success . 
If you &apos;re 10 teams that have typical procedures , you get about six , the stable structures have . 
I tried now something exciting . 
I thought , let &apos;s bring the poker bet in the same way . 
So , I offered a $ 10,000 prize of software for the winners . 
What do you think happened to these design students ? 
What was that ? 
Result . That &apos;s what happened . It &apos;s not . A team had a stable structure . 
If anyone had a two @-@ inch @-@ tall construction , they would have won the prize home . 
Is it , then , not interesting that high betting bets have a strong effect ? 
We repeated these exercises with the same students . 
What do you think ? They did . Well , it happened . Understandably 
, they understood the advantage of prototyping . 
So this is how the same bad team , one of the best , got out of the same bad team . 
They made the highest construction in the world , in the least time . 
It &apos;s like , there are profound lessons for us about nature of propulsion and success , and it &apos;s a very interesting idea . 
It &apos;s a question . Why would someone actually spend time investing ? A Marshmallow challenge to create ? 
The reason is , I help digital tools and processes create digital tools and processes to help teams . Cars , video games and visual effects to create . 
And what the Marshmallow Challenge does is : It helps them create hidden assumptions , identify them . 
Because , frankly , every project has its own Marshmallow . The challenge is to 
create a shared experience . A shared language or attitude , the right prototype , 
to build . And this is the value of these experiences . This experience , so simple exercise , 
and those of you who are interested in it , can do 
it . MarshmallowChallenge . COM : Visit : It &apos;s a blog where you can see how to make the Marshmallows , 
right ? It &apos;s a step @-@ by @-@ step guide there . 
It &apos;s where you can find crazy examples from all over the world , like people optimize and refining the system . 
It &apos;s also world records , 
and the basal lesson , I think , is construction . In fact , a connecting sport , 
it requires that we all have our senses on the task of doing this , and that we have the best possible use of our thinking , like our emotions and our actions in the challenge ahead of us . 
And sometimes it &apos;s a small prototype of this experience . Everything that it takes us to get away from an UH @-@ Oh to a TA @-@ DA moment . 
And that can make a big difference . 
Thank you very much . 
Do we do it as if we have a machine here 
? A big machine . A cool TED @-@ like machine . And that &apos;s a time machine . 
And everybody in this room has to enter . And they can enter into the past . 
They can go into the future . They can &apos;t go into the here and now . 
And I ask myself , what do you choose because I would mean to my friends last time , often ? These questions were asked , and they wanted all of you to go into the past . 
I know not . They wanted to go into time . Before it was cars , or Twitter or America is looking for the 
superstar . I know not . 
I am convinced that you somehow want to nostalgia for wishful thinking , to be drawn to . 
And that &apos;s what I understand . 
I &apos;m not part of it . This group needs me to say , &quot; 
I don &apos;t want to go back to the past , &quot; and that &apos;s not because I &apos;m an adventurer . It &apos;s because 
it &apos;s because opportunities on this planet are not going back . They &apos;re going forward . 
I want to go into this machine . And I want to go into the future . 
This is the greatest time , the greatest time it ever has on this planet . No matter what scale you &apos;re applying , health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , falling rates of disease . 
It was never before that time that we had . 
My great grandparents all died . When they died 60 , 
my grandparents urged these numbers to go to 70 . 
My parents are the 80 to 80 . 
On the heels . There should be better a nine @-@ fold . AM : At the beginning of my death . 
But it &apos;s not even a question of people like us . Because this is a bigger thing . It &apos;s 
a kid who &apos;s in New Delhi today , who can expect to live for as long as the richest man on earth . Before 100 years ago , you 
think about it . That &apos;s a tremendous fact . 
And why is this so ? The 
smallpox , smallpox , has billions of people on this planet killed . 
They &apos;ve got demographics of the Earth on a way to reinvent the way it &apos;s not a war ever managed to do . 
They &apos;re gone . They &apos;re gone . 
We &apos;ve got them defeated . Puff 
in the rich world exist . Diseases that millions of millions of us have just one generation ago threatened , just in the world . Hardly ever 
diphtheria . Rubella Polio knows anything 
at all . Still , someone else , what that is . Vaccines 
, modern medicine . Our ability to treat billions of people . That &apos;s successes of the scientific method . 
And from my point of view , the scientific method is to try things out . Look . Whether it works . It changes . If it changes that if it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity . 
That &apos;s what the good news is . 
Unfortunately , that &apos;s already the whole good news . Because it &apos;s a couple of other problems . And they &apos;ve been mentioned many times . 
And one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people on this planet , every day , hungry to bed . 
These numbers are rising , and they &apos;re rising very quickly . And that &apos;s embarrassing . 
And not only that . We have our imagination to use to make this world thoroughly . 
To devastate this world : Drinking water , primal land . Rainforest , oil . Gas . It disappears . And that &apos;s about to disappear . And if we look at it , not from this chaos , we disappear . 
The question is , can we do that ? I think we can . 
I think it &apos;s clear that it &apos;s food that we can produce . The billions of people who feed without that land on the land where they live , without rape . 
I think we can do this world with energy . We can power this world that doesn &apos;t destroy it at the same time . 
I think that &apos;s really what I think . And no . That &apos;s not wishful thinking . 
But that &apos;s what keeps me at night awake . One of the things that keeps me awake at night . We have scientific progress yet to date , so much needed as we have never before . 
And we &apos;ve also been unprecedented . We &apos;ve never been able to use it sensibly , as we do today , as we can . 
We are at the threshold of the amazing , amazing events on many fronts . And yet , I really think that we have hundreds of 300 years before the Enlightenment , back to go back to a time to find a time when we &apos;re fighting progress , where we &apos;re talking about these things more vigorously , on more fronts , than we have now . The 
people are wrapping themselves in their faith and that &apos;s how narrow that you can put them out of the box . 
Not even . The truth is it &apos;s going to get rid of . 
And hear them . Everybody has a right to their right to their opinion . Even a right to their opinion . 
But you know what they &apos;re not entitled to ? 
They have no right to their right to their own . Facts , charges , they don &apos;t have . 
And I have a while taken . To do that , to figure out 
about a decade ago , I wrote an article about immunization for The New Yorker , a little article . 
And I was amazed at resistance to resistance . I was amazed to encounter resistance to what ended up being the most effective healthcare measure in the history of humanity , the most effective way to do it . 
I knew not what I was doing to do it . So I did just what I did , always . I wrote a paper and I drove on . 
And soon afterwards , I wrote an article about genetically modified organisms . Food that was the 
same thing , just bigger . The 
people played crazy . 
So I got mad about it as well . And I could not understand why I did . The people thought that was frankenfood . Why ? They thought that molecules were on a certain molecule , rather than a random way of moving around , an attack on the territory of nature . 
But you know , I do what I do . I wrote the article . I did it . 
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist . 
We type . We pass on . We go eat . We go eat . That &apos;s okay . 
But this article did make me worry . And I could not figure out why . And finally , I found out . 
And that &apos;s because it &apos;s because these fanatics who mad me , they make me crazy . Anyway , anyway . No fanatics were . 
That was prudent people , educated people , decent people . 
They were exactly like the people , like the people in this room . 
And that brought me that mess up . 
But then I thought , &quot; You know what ? Let &apos;s be honest . 
We &apos;re at a point where we &apos;ve reached a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we used to have . 
We talk in two ways about it . 
We talk in ironic terms about it with small quotes . So progress . Okay . For 
that , there are reasons . And I think we know what we know why these are . 
We have that trust in institutions . We have trust in authority , and sometimes in science itself . And it &apos;s not that there &apos;s any reason why this is not supposed to be the case . 
You can just have a few names . And the people are going to understand 
Chernobyl , Bhopal . The Challenger Vioxx weapons of mass destruction , the 2000 US presidential election . I mean , 
you know , you can have your own list . 
It &apos;s got questions and problems with the people of which people we thought we were going to be right . Be right , so be skeptical . Imagine if you 
ask questions , &quot; Do you want evidence ? &quot; &quot; Do you demand evidence ? 
&quot; Take evidence . Take it for granted . 
But now , if you get evidence , you have to accept that evidence . And in it we &apos;re not good . And I can do that from 
the reason I say that we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear . How do I live in an epidemic of fear that I &apos;ve never seen before , and hopefully will never see again ? Before 
about 12 years ago , a story was published . A terrible story , which is the autism epidemic with the measles , mumps and rubells , vaccine , was linked . 
Very scary , 
shocking , shocking . Studies were done to help see . Was that true ? Hooked . 
Studies were supposed to be done . That &apos;s a serious matter . 
The data came in . 
The data came in . From the United States , from England , from Sweden , from Canada . And they were all the same . No correlation . No connection , no connection at all . 
It makes no difference . It makes no difference . Because we &apos;re anecdotes , believe in . We believe what we see , what we see , what we believe to see , what causes us to feel real . 
We believe not in a bundle of documents from a government @-@ anguish who gives us data . And I understand that . I think that &apos;s what we do . We all do . 
But we all know what ? That &apos;s 
the result of that was catastrophic , catastrophic . 
Because of that fact . The United States is one of the only countries on earth to have a global vaccination rate for measles falling . 
That &apos;s scandalous . And we should be ashamed . 
It &apos;s terrible . 
What is happening ? That we &apos;re doing that . 
Well , I understand that . That &apos;s what I do . 
Because did I have a measles here ? 
Has a single maser in the audience ? JE : Somebody at measles dying ? 
Not happening very often , 
it happens . In this country , not at all . But 160 000 times on the country , 160 000 times in the world , last year . 
That &apos;s a lot of measles &apos; deaths , 20 per hour . 
But because that &apos;s not happening here , you can do it out of place . And people like Jenny McCarthy can do things and they can walk around and they can get messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like Oprah and Larry King preach live . And 
that can be done because they &apos;re causing and correlation and not connecting . 
They understand not that these things are the same to seem the same , but almost never the same . 
And that &apos;s something that we &apos;re learning to learn . And that &apos;s very fast . 
This guy was a hero . Jonas Salk . 
He liberated us from a guy who was one of the worst scourges of humanity . 
No fear , no torment , polio . Puff disappeared . 
The guy in the middle , not so much . 
He &apos;s called Paul Offit . 
He has just been with a couple of other people a 
rotavirus vaccine . He can use life to 400 lives , 500,000 children per person a year in developing countries to save them . 
Pretty good . Not . 
Well , that &apos;s good . Apart from the fact that Paul is walking around talking about vaccines and saying , &quot; How valuable they are , and that people just should stop talking about complaining . 
&quot; And that says , in fact , he . 
That &apos;s Paul &apos;s a terrorist , so that &apos;s how he says . 
So Paul is a terrorist when he speaks at a public hearing , he can &apos;t say without armed guards . 
He gets calls to his home because the people tell him they like to tell him they know where his kids are going to school . 
And why ? Because Paul is using a vaccine . 
I need that not to say . But vaccines are essential . 
Take them . Turn them back . Terrible diseases . And that &apos;s what &apos;s happening right now . 
We have in this country now , measles . 
And that &apos;s getting worse . And pretty soon , kids will be back to dying . Because that &apos;s just one question . The numbers . 
And they will not just be on measles . 
What is the polio ? Take the polio . Why not ? 
A fellow militant of mine has given me a couple of weeks ago and said , &quot; She believes I &apos;m a little bit too shrill . 
Nobody has that . JE : Ever before 
she said she would not fight polio against polio . She would never , in any case , 
fine . 
Why ? Because we don &apos;t have polio . And you know what ? 
We had in this country yesterday , no polio . 
Today , I don &apos;t know . Maybe it was this morning that somebody in Lagos went on an airplane and was flying right to Los Angeles . In the moment , he &apos;s over Ohio 
and into a few hours , he &apos;s landed . He and he rents a car . And he comes after Long Beach . And he &apos;s going to be one of those fantastic things . TEDDinner today evening , visit . 
And he knows not that he &apos;s going to be paralyzed with a disease . And we know that as well , not . Because that &apos;s how the world works . Now , let &apos;s say 
that &apos;s the planet on which we live . Do you not do that as if 
he &apos;s not ? We love it . We love lying in lies . We love that . Do you 
have that all this morning ? Your vitamins took 
Echinacea . A little antioxidant that gives you a little jump to the jumps . 
I know that you do that . Because you did half of the Americans , that every day , do it . 
You take that stuff . And you take alternative remedies . And it does not make any difference how often we find out that they &apos;re useless . 
The data shows that all the time . 
They evaporate their urine . More do they do almost never . 
That &apos;s okay . You want to like 28 billion dollars for dark urine to pay . 
I agree with you completely 
: Dark urine , dark . 
Why do we do that ? Why do we do that ? 
Well , I think I understand . We hate the pharmaceutical industry . 
We hate a drug industry too strong a government . We have no confidence in the system . 
And that should be what we should not . Our healthcare system is bad . 
It &apos;s cruel to millions of people . 
It &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and cold and soul @-@ deafening , even to us who afford it . 
We walk , therefore , away from it , and where do we go ? 
We walk in the arms of the placebo industry . 
That &apos;s great . I love the placebo industry . 
But you know , that &apos;s really a serious matter . Because that stuff is crap . And we give billions of dollars to do that . 
And I have all sorts of little props here , 
none of them . Gingko fraud . Echinacea fraud . Acai . There you know , I don &apos;t even know what that is . But we give billions of dollars to do that . It &apos;s fraud . 
And you know what ? If I do that , I scream at people shouting at me and saying , &quot; What cares you , let &apos;s do it . &quot; The people , anyway , do what they want . That &apos;s 
how they feel good . And 
they know what ? They have a wrong point , 
because I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the Health Minister . The Health Minister says , &quot; Hmm , I &apos;m going to get the evidence from my experts on mammography , or any cancer quack salver who wants to treat his patients with coffee intakes . 
&quot; If they get to this path , they go where faith and magic prove and science prove and replace . If they get to a place , where they don &apos;t be , they get to be . 
They get to Thabo Mbeki , in South Africa . 
He brought 400 000 of his people around because he was on the insistence that red beds , garlic and lemon oil are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs , of which we know they &apos;re going to be the ones that can slow down the course of AIDS . 
Hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country . This is worse than any other of these diseases , plagued by the disease , 
please tell me not that these things don &apos;t have consequences . The ones you have . 
The ones you always have . 
Now , the most brain @-@ free epidemic we &apos;re in right now is this absurd fight between the advocates of genetically modified foods . And the bio @-@ elite . 
That &apos;s a stupid debate . They have to stop . 
It &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors . 
That &apos;s ideology , not science . 
Everything that we eat . Every grain of rice , every branch of parsley . Every sprouts have been cut by people . 
You know , there was no mandarin in paradise . 
It was not Cantaloupe melons . It was not Christmas trees . We have that all done . 
We have it in the last few 11 000 years . 
And some of it worked and some of it didn &apos;t . 
We &apos;re got rid of what doesn &apos;t work . 
Now , we can do it more precisely . And of course , there are risks . But we can do something like vitamin A in rice , in rice . And that stuff can do to millions of people . Millions of people , their lives , to prolong . 
That &apos;s what they don &apos;t want to do . 
I have to say , I understand that . 
We reject genetically modified food . 
Why do we do that ? 
Well , what I hear all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture . We want no huge fields with huge fields with one thing . That &apos;s wrong . 
We want not to have companies live patenting . 
We want not to have companies seed @-@ owning . 
And you know what ? My answer to all of this is , 
yes . You have been right . Fix . Let &apos;s fix that . 
It &apos;s true . We have a huge food problem . But that &apos;s not science . 
That &apos;s what science has nothing to do with . 
It &apos;s right . Morality , patent crab . 
You know that the science is not a company . 
It &apos;s not a country . 
It &apos;s not even a idea . It &apos;s a process . 
It &apos;s a process . And sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t . But the idea that we &apos;re going to be unable to allow science to do its work . Because we &apos;re afraid , it &apos;s a real impasse . And it keeps millions of people in the flourishing world . 
You know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to get 70 percent more food to grow . When we &apos;re 70 percent right now , 
this investment in Africa . In Africa , in the last 30 years , 
embarrassing , shameful . 
You need that . And we &apos;re giving it to you . 
And why ? Genetically modified food . 
We want people not to encourage this rotten stuff to eat . 
Maniok is something that is half a billion people eating . 
It &apos;s about like a potato . 
It &apos;s just a bundle of calories . It &apos;s bad . 
It has no nutrients . It has no protein . And scientists are building all this right in there . 
And then you could get people to eat and you wouldn &apos;t be blind . 
They would not starve . And you know what ? 
That would be nice . It would not be Chez Panisse . But it would be nice . 
And everything that I did to that end is why . Fighting against that . 
I mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves . Why fight against that ? 
Because we don &apos;t push genes around . 
It &apos;s not about genes being pushed around . It &apos;s not about chemicals . 
It &apos;s not about our ridiculous ridiculous ones . Passion for hormones . Our insistence on greater food , better food , unique food . 
It &apos;s here , not rice . Krispies . It &apos;s here , people live , people keep alive . And it &apos;s going to be high time to understand what that means . 
Because you know what ? 
If we do not do that , if we continue to do the same thing as we do before . Do we do it to something that we owe ourselves to , I don &apos;t think we want to be guilty of ? High @-@ tech colonialism . 
It &apos;s not any other description for the description . What &apos;s happening here ? 
It &apos;s selfish . It &apos;s ugly . It &apos;s our not worthy . And we have to really stop that . 
After this incredibly funny conversation , we want you , maybe , to say , &quot; Do you still want to be in this ridiculous time machine ? &quot; And in the future , go . To any 
case . That wants me to be definitely . 
In the moment , she &apos;s in the present . But we have a tremendous opportunity , 
right ? We can do this time machine on everything . What we want , 
we can do it where we can move it on . And we will move it on there . Where we want to go . 
We need to do these conversations . And we need to think . But if we &apos;re going to go into the time machine and into the future , we &apos;re going to be happy to have done that . 
I know that we &apos;re able to do it , and as far as I &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something that the world needs now . 
Thank you . 
Thank you . Thank you . When Steve Lopez , a columnist of the Los Angeles Times , one day walked through the streets in the center of Los Angeles , he heard wonderful music . 
It came from a man , a African @-@ American , sympathetic , rough , homeless , who was playing on a violin , who had only two strings left . 
Many of you will be telling the story . Because from Steves &apos; articles about this later on , a book that was filmed again . With Robert Downey , Junior , when Steve Lopez . And Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Anthony Ayers , the contrabass player who was studying at the Juilliard Conservatory , and whose promising career tragically early on was ended by paranoid schizophrenia . 
Nathaniel left Juilliard , suffered a nervous breakdown . And 30 years later , he lived as homeless on the homeless in the streets of Skid Row . In the center of Los Angeles . 
I recommend you all Steves &apos; book to read or get to know the movie so that you don &apos;t just read the wonderful connection . The between these two men that arose between them , but also , like the music , how the music creates this connection . Helped . And how they eventually helped the instrument was when this play of words is allowed . That helped Nathaniel away from the word street to get away . 
I met Mr. Ayers in the year 2008 . Before two years ago , in the Walt Disney Concert Hall . 
He had just had a demonstration of Beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony and symphony , and he came behind the stage to get to imagine myself . 
He spoke in a very cheerful , very sociable tone about the yo @-@ yo . MA : And Hillary Clinton and about how the Dodgers did it never in the baseball , world series , and how ? And that &apos;s all because of the insidious passage of the first violin last sentence of the Beethoven . Fourth Symphony : 
We came up with the theme of &quot; Music . &quot; And a few days later , a few days later , I got an email saying that Nathaniel was in favor of violin lessons with me . 
I have to mention that Nathaniel is a medical treatment that he refused , because he was already in the process of electroshocks and thorazine and handcuffs , and he was treated with electroshocks . One trauma that caused him all his life to persecute . 
When he was in the process of doing this , he &apos;s now particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases . The ones are sometimes so bad that they can make him tear up . And he &apos;s disappearing for days . In the streets of Skid Row , he &apos;s always wandering around this horror and the torture torment of his own mind , and in just 
one stage of excitement , Nathaniel was when we were in our first lesson in the Walt Disney Concert Hall , when we started our first lesson . He had this misconception of flickering in his eyes and he was working completely lost . 
He spoke about invisible demons and invisible smoke and about how things like someone in sleep would poison him . 
I had a fear , not for me , but for fear that I would lose him , that he would be put in one of his states , and that I would give him his relationship with the violin . If I started talking about clay ladders and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy , 
that &apos;s what I think is going to happen . I started talking about just a few things . 
I played the first sentence of the Beethoven Violin Concerto . 
And as I played , I fell on the ground that in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes , a complete change was taking place . It was when 
it was under his control , under the influence of an invisible doctor , a chemical reaction of its catalyst . My game was Nathaniels &apos; maniac . 
Wrath turned into anger , understanding , into a calm curiosity and grace . 
And how through a miracle did a miracle , he took his violin and began hearing . Some excerpts of violin concerts to play and asked me to play them , and then they ended . Mendelssohn Chaikovsky , Sibelius . 
We started then , about music , to talk about . Beginning from Bach to Beethoven , Brahms , Bruckner and all of the other BS of Bartók to Beethoven , to Esa @-@ Pekka Salonen . 
And I became aware that he was not only a cyclopedic encyclopedia of knowledge about music , but he was with it , also a close personal relationship , and 
he was very much in touch with it . He spoke about her with a little passion and a sense of understanding that I would otherwise only talk about my colleagues in the Philharmonic of Los Angeles . 
He was talking about playing music and about music and talking about music , and that paranoid , confused man who was just being thrown through the streets of Los Angeles , was a kind , educated , excellent Juilliard @-@ trained musician . 
( Music is medicine ) ( Music changes us 
for Nathaniel ) means music , mental health . 
Because the music allows it to be . His thoughts and delusions with the help of his imagination and creativity in something real , transform it into something real . 
And so , he escapes his tormenting state . 
I understood that exactly that , that is the essence of art . 
That &apos;s exactly what the reason why we &apos;re making music so that we can do something within all of us deep inside , something that &apos;s inside . Our feelings through our artistic lens , through our creativity , through our creation , can shape into reality . 
And the reality of that expression reaches us all , and moves , inspires and unites us what Nathaniel was about . 
So that brought him music back , back to a community of friends . The redeeming power of music brought him to return to a community of friends . 
The redeeming power of music brought him back to a family of musicians who understood him , who recognized his talent and respected him . 
And I will always play with Nathaniel . No matter whether in the Walt Disney Concert Hall or in the Skid Row , because he reminds me of why he &apos;s a musician , I &apos;ve become a musician . 
Thank you very much . 
Bruno Giussani : Thank you very much . Thank you . 
Robert Gupta , 
Robert Gupta . I want to play something that I shamefully , the cellist stolen . 
I hope you will forgive me . 
I am Jane McGonigal . I design computer games . 
I develop now since 10 years . I &apos;ve been online games , and my goal for the next decade is to make it just as easy . The world in which reality is happening to save as it is in online games is 
to save . I have a plan for that . I want more people to convince , including all of you , more time playing . Greater and more great games to spend . 
Right now , we spend three billion hours a week playing online . 
Some of you think maybe that &apos;s what it &apos;s like to spend a lot of time playing games . 
Maybe a little too much time . If you think about how many problems we &apos;re having in the real world , how 
many problems we really need to solve in the real world ? But in my research at the Institute for the Future , according to my research , that &apos;s exactly the opposite . Right ? 
Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough . It &apos;s not nearly enough to solve the world &apos;s most pressing problems . 
In fact , I &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to dramatically increase that time . 
I have calculated that the time needed is about 21 billion dollars a time of play . Per week 
, that &apos;s what it might seem a little bit absurd at first . So I repeat , so it &apos;s with it . It &apos;s able to work if we can have problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , believe . I have to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week , up to the end of the next decade . 
No . I mean , it &apos;s really serious . 
Why ? This picture 
describes quite exactly . Why ? I think that games are so vital to the survival of the human species in the human future . Seriously . 
This is a portrait of the photographer . Phil Toledano . 
He wanted to make the feelings of playing . So he has in front of the players a camera . 
This is one of the classic expressions of playing . 
If you don &apos;t play a player , you may miss some of the nuances . In this picture , 
you probably see this sense of urgency , something fear , but also extreme concentration , deeply deepened in the solving of a real difficult problem . 
If you &apos;re playing , you &apos;ll see some nuances . Here &apos;s the upward @-@ drawn eyes . And the mouth is a sign of urgency , The eyebrows show surprise . 
This is a player who &apos;s on the edge of what &apos;s called a &quot; the &quot; Epic victory . 
Oh ! She knows that . 
OK ? Great ! So , we have some players . Here &apos;s 
an epic . Victory is a result that is so extraordinary positive . You didn &apos;t even know before that it was possible at all . 
It was almost beyond imagination . And if you did it , you &apos;re shocked that you &apos;re actually going to be doing something like 
that . That &apos;s a epical victory . 
This player is standing on the verge of an epic victory . 
And this is it , what we &apos;re doing on millions of faces of problem solvers all over the world . If we &apos;re going to break the hurdles of the next century , face of those who face the odds of all odds . AM : On the brink of an epic victory . 
Well , unfortunately , we &apos;re more likely to see this face in real life . If we &apos;re going to face difficult problems , 
I call it that . In life , I &apos;m bad at face . 
And it &apos;s actually my face , right ? See , yeah . OK . 
That &apos;s me . How I do that in life ? I &apos;m bad at face . 
This is a graffiti in my life , my former home in Berkeley , California , where I did my PhD study on why we do better in games than in real life . 
That &apos;s a problem . That &apos;s a lot of players we think 
we have in the reality , not so good in reality as in games . And 
I mean , not only less successful , although that &apos;s part of it . 
We &apos;re reaching into more games . 
I mean , good in connection with the motivation , something meaningful about doing . Inspired in collaboration with each other . 
When we &apos;re in a game world , I think many people in us think that we &apos;re in our best version , at any time and immediately , helpful , persistent to solve the problem . Try trying to solve the problem as long as necessary after the failure . And try again 
in reality , when we fail , when we hit obstacles , we feel like we often feel different . 
We feel like we &apos;re overwhelmed . We feel like we &apos;re defeated . We feel like we &apos;re threatened . Maybe depressed , frustrated or cynical . 
These feelings have been never felt . If we play games in games , there are them , just don &apos;t exist . 
And that &apos;s it . That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to study as a PhD student . 
Why is it in games impossible to do thinking ? You could not just think 
anything could be done . How can we do that feeling out of the games into the reality ? 
So , I looked at games like World of Warcraft . This is what the ideal environment for community problem solving is . 
And I have some things to say . The epic victories in online worlds , as possible . 
So first , if you go into one of these online games , especially at World of Warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are ready to give you a world saving mission , and they &apos;re ready to do so immediately . 
But not only any mission , but also a mission that &apos;s perfect for your current level . In the game , 
right ? So , you can do that . 
You get never a task that you can &apos;t solve . 
But always on the edge of your skills . So you have to make an effort . 
But it &apos;s not unemployment that exists in World of Warcraft . You &apos;re not sitting around and you turn around demons . It &apos;s always quite targeted . There &apos;s something important to do . 
And it &apos;s kind of employees where 
you go , wherever you go . Hundreds of thousands of people who have collaborated with you to get your epic mission done . 
That &apos;s what we have in real life . Not so easy , that feeling that when you have a fingertip , employees are willing to be hired in ways . 
And there &apos;s also this epic story . These inspiring stories , why do we &apos;re there ? And what we &apos;re doing is what we get to get this whole positive feedback . It &apos;s certainly something that 
you &apos;ve got from level up . And one strength heard or one strength heard or one intelligence . 
This constant feedback gives you no idea what &apos;s true in life . 
If I want to leave this stage , I don &apos;t have one speech and one crazy idea . 20 crazy idea . 
I get 20 real life . This feedback , not . 
So , the problem of online collaboration worlds like World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying . Anytime , on the edge of an epic victory , that we prefer to stand on the edge of these games all the time . 
They &apos;re just better than the world of reality . 
Until now , all the World of Warcraft players together have 5.93 million years to spend on the virtual problems of virtual Azerbaijan . 
That &apos;s not necessarily something bad . 
It sounds like bad . 
But to do it , in context , I think , five @-@ 93 million years ago , they started . Our first primate ancestors , they started 
walking upright . The first upright primacy . 
So OK . So if we talk about how we &apos;re going to spend so much time playing games at the moment . Make this just sense . When do you start to spend time looking at the scale of the human development ? Before you look at what &apos;s extraordinary , but also appropriate . 
Because it &apos;s coming out that it turns out that by doing all this time at play , we &apos;re going to play . In fact , change what we &apos;re doing as humans , in a way that 
we &apos;re able to do . We &apos;re developing into a community . Thinking , cordial beings . 
That &apos;s the truth . That &apos;s what I believe in . 
Look at this one of the interesting statistics that we recently have from a Carnegie Mellon researcher at University , published . The average young person of today , in a country with a strong playing culture , spends 10,000 hours with online games , up to the age of 21 . 
So 10 000 hours is a 10,000 hours , an extremely interesting number for two reasons . 
First of all , for children in the United States , 10 080 hours is . The exact total time you spend in the school is about 10 080 hours from the fifth grade to the high @-@ school completion . If you never miss it , 
so we have here a complete parallel education path where young people are learning the same way . What it means is a good player to be like everything , like anything else you &apos;re doing in school . 
And maybe you have some of them learning the new book from Malcolm Gladwell , &quot; Overflying Flyer . &quot; So you know his theory of being successful . The theory of success , the theory of 10,000 hours . You know , 
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science that if we spend 10,000 hours with laborious study of any subject , until we 21 years of age , we will master it , in it . 
We will be so good at what we do , whatever . Like the most important people of the world . 
So what we &apos;re having here is a complete generation of young people . The master players are the big ones . 
Question : Is what ? Exactly , are players masterful ? Good . Because if we do this 
, if we could figure out , we would have , kind of , never before , ever @-@ known human potential at our disposal . 
So many people have we at present in the world , the world , who have at least an hour a day playing online . 
This is our master players : 500 million people , who are exceptionally well placed in something . 
And in the next decade , we have another billion players , the extraordinary good at playing what is whatever . 
If you do it not yet heard it , 
the game industry has developed . Consoles , the energy saving and the mobile network working instead of broadband Internet . So players on the whole world are particularly active in India . China , Brazil , can play online , you can expect . 
You can expect an additional billion players over the next decade . 
So this is the total number of players we have . Five billion players . 
So I have started to think about what it is . What we have in these games to master . Here are the 
four things that are the four things I found . When I first came up with urgency optimism . 
OK . Imagine if you could , like extreme self @-@ motivation . 
Urgent optimism is desire to do something right away . An obstacle to overcome together with the challenge of believing that we &apos;re going to have a reasonable hope of success . 
Players believe always in believing that a epical victory is possible . And that it &apos;s possible always worth it , it &apos;s worth trying . And that &apos;s equal . 
Players don &apos;t sit around . 
Players are masters in spiders . Poets of social networks . 
It &apos;s a lot of interesting research . The ones show that we people more like after we &apos;re having them play with . Even if they let us face evil 
, The reason for that is that it &apos;s a lot of trust that requires someone to play a game . 
We trust in someone to have time with us . We trust that the rules will be respected . We trust that we have the same goal , and we will stay with them until the end of the game . 
So it allows us to play together , to grow ties , trust and to interact as a result . 
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re building stronger social relationships , happy 
productivity . Fantastic . 
You know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of Warcraft player is 22 hours a week . So , as part @-@ time job . 
It &apos;s because , if we &apos;re playing , we &apos;re actually happier at it , hard working . When , if we relax or relax or do nothing , 
we know we &apos;re human @-@ being @-@ optimal . When we &apos;re hard , meaningful work done , 
and players are always ready to work hard . When they do the right job , 
and eventually , epic meaning , 
players love it , part awe . Command missions of planetary proportions to become . 
Here &apos;s a background information to get this right . You know , you probably all know Wikipedia . That &apos;s the biggest Wiki in the world . That &apos;s the 
second largest Wiki in the world , with almost 80,000 entries . That &apos;s the World of Warcraft Wiki , 
five million people use it every month . 
They have more information about World of War Warcraft at the Internet , than they &apos;ve collected about any other topic . In every other Wiki that &apos;s in the world . 
They create a epic story . 
They create an epic source of the knowledge about the World of War Warcraft . 
OK . That &apos;s what four superpowers are , which lead to a single result . Players are super powerful , hopeful individuals . 
It &apos;s people who believe that they &apos;re considered as individuals , the world can change . 
And that only problem is that the only problem is they believe . They can do virtual worlds change . But they can &apos;t do real worlds . 
That &apos;s the problem that I have to solve . 
Edward Castronova is a scientist . 
His work is awesome . 
He &apos;s studying why . People like that have so much time , energy and money spent on online worlds . 
And he says , &quot; We &apos;re witnessing not less than a mere mass emigration into virtual worlds and online gaming environments . &quot; 
And that of a economist , that &apos;s why he &apos;s logical . 
And he says , &quot; Not as I do . &quot; I develop games . I &apos;m something exuberant . 
So he says that makes actually this sense . Because players can play in online worlds more than they can in real life . 
They can do in games stronger social ties , than in real life , They get more feedback and rewards and rewards in games than in real life . 
So he says it &apos;s currently , absolutely logical that players can do more time in real life in the virtual world than in real life . 
I agree with you first . That &apos;s logical . 
But it &apos;s definitely . No optimal situation . 
We have to start to build the real world into a game . 
My inspiration comes from a moment of events . That second 500 years ago . It &apos;s been 
these ancient cubes from . Sheepskin dumplings , you know , 
in front of these fantastic game econtrollers , there were sheep dumplings . 
And that was sort of the first of people @-@ made toys . And if you &apos;re going to work with the works of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus , you might know this story . The story about how and why and how games were invented . 
According to Herodotus , games became more accurate craps in the kingdom of Lydia during famine . It was alleged 
that there was such a great famine that the king of Lydia became a king of lydia , and decided to become a crazy idea . The 
people suffered the people , the people fought . 
It was a extreme situation . You needed a extreme solution . 
So they invented it . According to Herodotus , the dice game , and agreed a national strategy . At one day , you would eat . At the next day , you would play 
and they would play so much into the dice game , and they would be so deeply immersed . There , games so fascinating and so fascinating and satisfying , happy productivity surround us that they forget they would be , there &apos;s nothing to eat . 
And then , the next day , you would play . And then the next day you would eat . 
And according to Herodotus , they survived 18 years of this for famine by surviving from the famine in one day . And then the next day 
they played , I think . Sit us today , play games . We put games in order 
to give the suffering of the real world away . We put games in order to do everything away with that that &apos;s in the real world that doesn &apos;t work . Everything that works in real life , not satisfying . And we get ourselves what we get , what we need . From the games . 
But that has to be the end , not the end . 
That &apos;s the exciting thing . 
According to Herodotus , after 18 years , famine didn &apos;t get any better . So , the king decided one last cube game . 
She shared that kingdom in two : Halves . 
She played a cube game . And the winners were allowed to become an epic adventure . 
They left lydia and made themselves up on the search for the ultimate new home . They left just like that many people behind as they left food for survival . And they were looking for the rest for a neighborhood in the rest of which they could thrive . 
That sounds crazy , right ? 
But the latest DNA evidence shows that the Etruscans , who later became the Roman Empire , are the ones who made it . The same DNA as the ancient DNA as the old lydians . 
So that &apos;s why scientists recently came to the conclusion that herodotus , crazy story , is actually true . 
And geologists found evidence of a global cooling that was almost 20 years long . What the famine explains could be , 
so this crazy story could be true . Maybe 
they have actually their people , through games , saved their people by 18 years of saving themselves in games , by escaping . And then this inspiration had , and so much about the famine , playing with each other , that it would make them save the entire civilization . 
So , that &apos;s what we can do . 
We play since 1994 Warcraft . 
That was the first strategy game in real time , the World of Warcraft series . 
That was before 16 years ago . 
It was 18 years old . Craps . We play since 16 years Warcraft @ games . 
I &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game , 
right ? So they sent them half of their civilization to the search for the search for a new world . So , I &apos;m taking my 21 billion hours of play a week . We should be agreeing that 
the world is half of us , one hour a day , playing games until we reach the problems of the real 
world , solving them . I know . You &apos;re going to ask , how do we solve problems of the real world in games ? And 
that &apos;s exactly the question I have in my work . In the last few years at the Institute for the Future , I &apos;ve been working on . 
We &apos;ve been banning this banner in our office in Palo Alto . It &apos;s a way we express the future , how we should understand it . 
We want not to try to try to predict the future before 
what we want is the future . 
We want to create the best possible outcome , and then people get empowered to do it . These ideas in the reality of realizing them . 
We are facing epic victories . We are giving people the chance to give them the means to achieve them . 
I &apos;m going to show you three games very briefly that I designed to play to try and emulate people epic victories in their own future , in my own right . 
This is this world without oil . 
This game is from 2007 . 
It &apos;s a game online where it &apos;s a shortage of oil that you have to overcome . This is a 
game where oil shortages are invented . But we have enough content online to make it available to you to realistically , and you can live your real life without oil . So if you look at the game , you say to us where you live . And then you get news movies in real time that show you . How much oil does what it costs , which is not there ? How does food supply affect , 
how does transport affect , whether schools are closed . Whether it affects riots . And you have to figure out how you can live your real life . If it &apos;s true and we do ask you to talk about blogging videos or photos or to stop them . 
We have this game with a one hundred and 700 players in 2007 . And we have them since then , through the last three years , been with them . 
And I can tell you it &apos;s been a changing experience . 
Nobody wants to live his life because it &apos;s good for the environment . Or ? Because we do . 
But if you &apos;re in an epic adventure , and you &apos;re told , &quot; Get us , oil is out . 
&quot; That &apos;s a fascinating adventure on the one hand that you &apos;re going to go to . 
Find out what you &apos;re going to survive . The majority of our players have the ones in the game that have kept the habits that they learned . So , we 
&apos;ve chosen to do the next world saving game . A bigger , higher goal than the only oil shortage . 
We &apos;ve got the Superstruct game on the Institute for the Future , developed it . 
The starting point is to calculate a supercomputer that people only have to 23 years to go on the planet . 
This supercomputer is called Global Dismortality Sensitization System , of course , 
the call to players to sign up . Have we almost , like a Jerry Bruckheimer film , 
made it ? They know Jerry Bruckheimer movies , where it &apos;s the dream team . They have the astronaut , the scientist , the ex @-@ Sträfling , and only together can they save the world . 
But in our game , instead of just five people , instead of saying , &quot; Everybody &apos;s on the dream team . &quot; And it &apos;s our job to do the future for energy , food , health , safety . And the future of social justice , to create 
. Eight thousand players played this game . Eight weeks , 
They found 500 incredible creative solutions . They can read them . If you Google Superstruct and 
the last game , we &apos;ll release it on March 3rd . It &apos;s a game in collaboration with the game of the World Bank . 
If you do the game , you &apos;ll get from the World Bank the award of social transformers , 2010 graduation . We &apos;re 
working with universities all over Sub @-@ Saharan Africa and invite them to redesign socially , learn how to do it . 
We have a comic book on this . We have levels up for regional level understanding , knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and ingenuity . 
I want to invite you all to play this game with young people to share . Everywhere on the planet , especially around the world , in developing areas that benefit from sharing their own social ventures together to imagine the world , to save the world . 
I come now to the end . 
I want to leave you with a question . 
What do you think is going to happen next ? 
We have all these fantastic players , right ? We have games that give us a picture of what we can do . But we have games that show us what we can do . But we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet . 
Well , I hope you agree that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a great deal of significance for change . 
We have these whole superpowers , happy productivity , the ability to have tight social networks , urgency optimism , and the desire for epiepical meaning . 
I hope really that we together together will play important games to get on this planet . A further century to survive . 
And I hope you will be able to join me in designing and playing such games . 
If I go to the next decade , I &apos;m going to be looking forward to two things : That we can create any imaginable future , and that we can create all kinds of games . So I &apos;m going to say , let &apos;s start the world @-@ changing games . 
Thank you . 
Since some time , I &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect . It may be strange that the world @-@ changing games are interested in this . It &apos;s not unless you look at it . It &apos;s the way I think of it as a deception that becomes something real . If somebody just gets stuck enough to believe in it , 
in other words , have sugar pills . In some studies , a measurable effect has been shown to have the placebo effect , just because the person thinks what to do with it is a pharmaceutical or a pharmaceutical or a kind of pain management . So for example , if the patient is only firmly enough , there is a measurable , measurable effect in the body that you can call the placebo effect . 
So a deception becomes something real , because somebody somebody like this perceives it so 
that we can also understand each other , and I want to give you a basic , very simple magic trick . 
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . That &apos;s a trick that &apos;s at least been around since the 1950s in every magic book . For kids , I stand , &quot; 
I have him from the Cub Scout Magic . &quot; The scout scout in the 1970s learned . 
I &apos;m going to teach him for you and then explain him . 
And then I &apos;m going to explain why I explain him . 
So , you see what happens . 
That knife , the knife you can study . My hand , the one you can study . 
I &apos;m going to just do that knife . In my fist , I &apos;m 
going to push my sleeves back . 
And around to make sure that nothing in my sleeves disappears or disappears from it , I &apos;m just going to make my wrist . Right here , squeeze it together . 
On those lines , you can see that there &apos;s no one at all moving . As long as I can get impressions here , nothing can go into my sleeves or come out . 
And that goal . And that &apos;s quite simple . 
I &apos;m going to open my hand . And hopefully , if everything goes well , that knife will go through my bare physical magnetism , and that &apos;s what 
I call it . It sits actually like this firmly on its place , that I can shake it without shaking it without the knife falling down , nothing moves 
into my sleeve , or comes out , no trickery . And it can do everything . 
TA @-@ DA : 
Now , this is a trick that I often use to try to teach small kids who are interested in magic . Because you can do it a lot about deception , because you can learn a lot about deception . If you &apos;re looking at it more closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick to do . 
I think many of you here probably know about this . This trick . 
It works like this . 
I think that knife is . In my hand . 
I say that I &apos;m going to close my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or comes out . And that &apos;s a lie . 
The reason why I &apos;m going to tie my wrist is because it &apos;s the real secret of the illusion . 
In that moment , when I &apos;m going to shake my hand away from you so that you can see it moving from behind , this finger moves . Here &apos;s my index finger just from where it was , in a position in which it was so 
stretched out , 
great trick . There &apos;s a guy sitting back there who 
had no childhood . So he &apos;s in here , right ? 
And if I &apos;m turning around , the finger changes its position . 
And now , you could talk about it . Why this ? A deception is why you don &apos;t perceive that this is down here , just three fingers to see . Because the mind and the way that the mind and the way it processes information doesn &apos;t count it individually . One , two , three , but you see it as a group . 
But that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about . Now , actually , here , not at all . And then open . I mean , hand . 
Of course , it &apos;s held there . But not by the magnetism of my body , but by a trick . By my index finger , which is now there . 
And if I &apos;m holding my hand , the same thing happens by turning back , it &apos;s by this movement hidden that the finger is again moving back . 
I &apos;m taking this hand away . And here &apos;s the knife . 
This trick can be done to your friends and neighbors . Thank you . 
Now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ? 
Well , a year ago or so , I read a study that really really cut me around . 
I &apos;m not a doctor , right ? Researchers and therefore , that was for me a really amazing thing . 
It has turned out that this is what happened . If you &apos;re using placebo in the form of a white pill , where you &apos;re in the form . One aspirin tablet is that it &apos;s just a round white pill that gives you a certain measurable effect . 
But if you &apos;re offering the shape in which you &apos;re using placebo to give placebo , for example , to a smaller pill . And these blue dyes and you color a letter on it is it actually measurable , more effective . And that , 
even though none of these are any pharmaceutical . It &apos;s just sugar pills , 
but a white pill is not that good as a single blue pill . 
What that made me really freak out of it . 
It put itself , however , out that this hasn &apos;t all been done yet . 
If you put capsules , they &apos;re still more effective than tablets . Everybody , shape 
, color capsule , that &apos;s at one end yellow . And at the other side red is better than one white capsule , 
right ? Also , dosage plays a role . 
A pill twice a day is not that good as three times a day . I can &apos;t get myself to the one that &apos;s just the statistics . Do I &apos;m sorry , 
the key thing is that 
the key thing is that dosage also plays a role . 
And the shape plays a role . 
And if you look at the ultimate placebo effect , you have to go to the needle . 
Right ? A syringe with a ineffective one . A few milliliters , an ineffective substance , you can give to a patient . 
That creates a very strong image of the head . That &apos;s very , much stronger . 
That &apos;s a white pill , this graph is really . I &apos;m going to give you another time . If we take a projector , 
the fact is , the fact is , the white pill isn &apos;t as good as the blue pill , which isn &apos;t so good . How a capsule that doesn &apos;t work so well as the one that &apos;s needle , 
and has none of it , has any really pharmaceutical property . It &apos;s just our faith in it , which is in us stronger impact . 
I wanted to know if I could take this idea for a magic trick . 
I take something that is obviously a deception . And I leave it real look . 
We know , of course , from that study , that you can grab a needle . If it goes to the point , 
this is a 18 @-@ inch @-@ long needle . It &apos;s very , very sharp . And I &apos;m going to start by giving you a little bit of sterilizing . That &apos;s 
this really my flesh . It &apos;s not Damian &apos;s special bred meat . 
That &apos;s this : My skin . That &apos;s not a special effect . Hollywood : 
I &apos;m going to now put this needle in my skin and through it , I &apos;m going to push it through until it &apos;s on the other side . 
Again , leaving . If you &apos;re getting bad when you &apos;re slightly powerless , if you &apos;re going to get sick . I have this . I have some friends . Last night , in the hotel room , I showed this to some people I didn &apos;t know . And there &apos;s a woman , almost powerless , who &apos;s been there . 
I propose , therefore , if you can quickly get bad at it . Then look at the situation for the next 30 seconds . Or you know what ? I &apos;m going to start the first delicate part back here . 
You can do it in a moment . You can see it also . If you want , 
so it &apos;s going to be right here where my meat starts . AM : At the bottom of my arm , I &apos;m just going to make a little bit of a break . Do 
I really sorry ? Do you do that crazy ? And now 
, just a little bit through my skin . And on the other side , like this , 
out again . Now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we &apos;re in with the knife trick . 
About . 
But now , you can put my fingers out . Or 
so , I &apos;m going to show you . That &apos;s one , two , three , four , five . 
Now , yeah , 
I know what people think . If you do see that , 
you say , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s probably not so stupid . &quot; And it goes through itself , the skin just to give us a few minutes to walk around . 
Now , then I &apos;ll tell you , I &apos;ll show you . 
How does that look like ? Pretty good . 
Yeah . I know . And the people in the back say , &quot; Okay , I didn &apos;t really see that . The 
people in the adjoining rooms come now in . &quot; Let &apos;s 
let me tell you from the nearby . That &apos;s 
really my skin . That &apos;s not a special effect . Hollywood , 
that &apos;s my flesh . And I can do that around . Do 
I &apos;m sorry ? If you &apos;re getting bad , look away . Look away . Don &apos;t look at 
people in the back or those who sometime later on watch this video , will say , Well , yeah . That looks like a pretty impressive thing . But if it &apos;s real , it would look like it &apos;s . You see , here &apos;s a hole . And there &apos;s a hole if it &apos;s really real , it would bleed . Okay . 
Let &apos;s let me just add a little blood to you . 
Yeah . Here &apos;s it . 
Normally it would be now that I would take out the needle . 
I would take out my arm and clean it and show you that there are no wounds there . 
But I think in this frame , here and with the one intent to get out of a deception something real , I &apos;m going to make the needle just out there . And so , from the stage , 
we &apos;re going to go into the next few days , and we &apos;ll meet again a few times . 
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . Thank you very much . 
So I have a lot of life in my life . 
I &apos;ve only known two . I loved only two . 
The first one was more like a passionate affair . 
It was a beautiful fish , tasty , good consistency , rich , a bestseller on the menu . 
What a good fish , 
even better . It got better in aquaculture after aquaculture , supposedly the highest standards of sustainability . 
You could imagine , then , that you could feel like selling it . 
I had a lot of beauty with this beauty , a relationship over several months . 
One day , the boss of the company called and asked , &quot; Do I know if I would be able to talk at an event about the sustainability of the farm ? 
&quot; Of course , I said , 
&quot; Here was a company that was trying to solve what this unimaginable problem for our chefs has become . How do we keep fish on our menus ? 
In the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been living fishing the seas , fishing forests , barren beaten . 
It &apos;s hard to see the destruction overestimated . 
90 percent of the big fish , who we love , the tuna , the curative butte , the salmon , the swordfish . They &apos;re collapsed . 
It &apos;s almost nothing more left . 
So it &apos;s likely to be aquaculture , or bad aquaculture , fishing . A part of our future will 
be many arguments against it , polluting fishing facilities . The environment , most of you , anyway , and you &apos;re inefficient . Take the tuna , a big disadvantage . 
It has a feed recovery of 15 percent to one . 
That means 15 pounds of wild fish are needed to make you a pound of farmed tuna . 
Not very sustainable tastes 
, not even very good . 
So here was finally a company , at last . The one who tried to get it right . 
I wanted to support them on 
the day before . The event called me the boss , the public relations officer , for the company . 
Call it the name . Don . 
Don said , I just said , &quot; To get the facts . Right ? &quot; &quot; Do you have a famous reputation for going so far out in the sea that you &apos;re not polluting the environment ? 
&quot; That &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; We &apos;re so far out there that the waste from our fish is distributed , not concentrated . &quot; 
And then he added , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re basically a separate one . 
These feed recycling of 2.5 percent to one percent , &quot; he said , 
&quot; the best in the industry , 
2.5 percent to one , great , 
2.5 percent to one , what feeds ? &quot; 
&quot; Your sustainable proteins , &quot; he said . 
&quot; Great , &quot; he said . &quot; I put up , 
and that evening I lay in bed thinking , &quot; What the hell is a sustainable protein ? 
&quot; So he called me the next day , just before the event , Don . 
I said , &quot; Don , what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot; 
He said , &quot; He doesn &apos;t know . &quot; He &apos;s going to ask . 
Now , I was telephoning with a couple of people in the company . Nobody could tell me a proper answer . Until I finally got started talking to the leading biologist . 
Call it the same . Don . 
Don said , &quot; What , for example , are sustainable ? &quot; 
Proteins . Well , he mentioned some algae and some fishmeal . And then he said , &quot; Chicken pellets . &quot; 
I said , chicken pellets . He 
said , &quot; Yes , feathers . &quot; Skin , bone meal , leftovers dried and processed into food . 
I said , &quot; How much percent of your ? &quot; Futters is chicken in the 
belief that chicken , maybe two percent . 
Now , these are about 30 percent , &quot; he said . &quot; 
I said , don . &quot; &quot; What &apos;s sustainable about it ? Chicken to feed fish ? &quot; 
It was a long break in the world of leadership . And he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chicken on the planet . &quot; 
I loved myself , and I loved this fish . 
No . Not because I was a self @-@ righteous connoisseur and a good man . 
That &apos;s me . Even 
no . I have no , actually , of this fish I &apos;ve loved because I swear to God , &quot; The fish after this conversation , after having tasted chicken . 
&quot; This second fish . This is a different species of fish love story . 
It &apos;s the romantic species that is the species where you &apos;re ever better off your own fish , the better you know your fish . Learning to learn the fish . 
The more you love it . I have it first in a fish restaurant in southern Spain . 
A friend journalist had been with us for a long time talking about this fish . 
She has been kind of cuddling us . 
He came up with the table with a bright one . Almost shimmering white color . 
The cook had him cooked . 
&quot; Stop twice . 
Amazing , he was still delicious . 
Who can buy a fish so well ? &quot; After he cooked , 
I can &apos;t . I can &apos;t . But this guy can &apos;t . 
Call it the Miguel . In fact , he &apos;s called Miguel . 
And no . He has the fish , not cooked . And he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way they do . And I &apos;m understanding it . 
He &apos;s a biologist with Veta , La Palma . 
That &apos;s a fish rearing in which southwest corner of Spain . 
They &apos;re near the mouth of the river Guadalquivir , right 
up to the 1980s . They were the farm in the hands of Argentines , 
they were growing meat cattle on what was essentially wetlands . 
They were doing that by doing that by drainage the land . 
They were building these complicated sequences of canals and they were pushing water out of the country , and out into the hands of Argentines . 
Now , they couldn &apos;t make it happen that didn &apos;t work economically 
and ecologically , it was a disaster . 
It brought about 90 percent of the birds around , which is what this place is , many birds . 
And so it happened in 1982 , when a Spanish company with environmental awareness bought the land . 
What did you do ? 
You did the river of water , the other way around . 
You did literally the lever , you put it around . 
Instead of the water pushing out , you used the channels to push the water back . Put it in . 
You flooded the channels . 
You created a 11 000 acres of land . You used to raise fish , perch , sea ash , shrimp . Eel and eel , and Miguel . And his company , the ecological destruction , completely reversed . 
The farm is incredible . 
I mean , you &apos;ve got something like this before . 
You &apos;re staring out at the horizon of one million miles , a million miles away , and everything you see is flooded canals . And these density , lush march . 
I was there in front of me , not long ago , with Miguel . 
He &apos;s a tremendous guy . Three parts . Charles Darwin and one part , one crocodile , for kissing . 
Okay . There were us and we fought ourselves through the wetlands . And I chastise and sweat . I have mud up to my knees . And Miguel keeps in peace . A biology lecture . 
Here &apos;s where he lifts a rare track . 
Now , he mentions mineral needs of phytoplankton . 
And here . Here &apos;s where he sees a pattern of bundles that will put him in the memory of Tanzanian giraffe . 
It &apos;s a little bit like Miguel , the majority of his career in Mikumi National Park in Africa , spent most of his career . 
I asked him , how did he go to a fish expert like this ? 
He said , &quot; Fish . I know nothing about fish . 
I &apos;m a professional in relationships . And 
then he goes and falls and falls into more talk . &quot; Rare birds and more algae . And strange aquatic plants . 
And you know , don &apos;t get me wrong . That was really fascinating . You know , the biotic community , unplugged . So , in the way 
it &apos;s great . But I was in love . 
And my head got weak over my head , this cooked piece . Delicious fish , which I saw on the eve . 
So I got him interrupted . I said Miguel . How does it happen that your fish is so good ? He 
showed up the algae . 
I know boy , the algae of phytoplankton , the relationships . That &apos;s incredible . 
But what do you eat ? 
How is the recycling of feed ? Well 
, he goes , &quot; I tell you that it &apos;s such a rich system . It &apos;s that the fish eat what they eat in the wild , 
&quot; &quot; The vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton . &quot; That &apos;s it . That &apos;s what the fish feed . 
That system is like healthy . It &apos;s completely self @-@ explanatory . 
It &apos;s not food . 
The food is from a farm . It doesn &apos;t feed its animals . 
Later on the day I drove on this plot with Miguel Miguel around . And I asked him . I said , &quot; For a place that &apos;s so natural to seem different from any place that is on which I ever been , &quot; &quot; How do you measure success ? &quot; 
&quot; In the moment it was when it was like a film director demanding a stage change . 
&quot; And we bowed around the corner , and we offered ourselves a set of incredible sights . Thousands and thousands of pinkers flamingos . A literally pinker carpet . So far as the eye reaches . 
That &apos;s success . Said he . 
Look at her bellies . Look at pink . 
She &apos;s smuggling , slugging 
. I was totally confused . 
I said Miguel , &quot; Don &apos;t mess your fish . &quot; 
Yeah , he said , &quot; We &apos;re losing . 
&quot; 20 percent of our fish and 20 percent of our fish eggs to the birds . 
Now , last year , on this plot , 600,000 birds were more than 250,000 different birds , 
right ? It &apos;s today the largest . And one of the most important private bird reserves in Europe has become . 
I said Miguel is a good bird . It &apos;s not a thriving bird population . It &apos;s the last one to be raised on a fish farm . He 
shook his head . No . 
He said , &quot; We &apos;re building extensively , not intensive . &quot; That &apos;s what 
this is , an ecological network . It &apos;s 
the flamingos that eat . It &apos;s the shrimps . It &apos;s 
the shrimps that eat the phytoplankton . 
The closer the pinker the belly , the better . That system : Okay 
. Let &apos;s let &apos;s rethink that . A farm that has its animals not feeding and a farm , a farm that is successful in health , in the way that its predators are . 
A fish rearing , but also a bird reserve . 
Oh . And by the way , these flamingos should not even be there from the outset . 
They breed in a city 240 in a mile away , where the soil quality is better . For the nest maintenance 
every morning , they fly 240 in a farm . 
And every night , they fly 240 in a row . 
They make that because they &apos;re the one who &apos;s dotted white line . The highway A92 , 
you can follow seriously . 
I had a very kind of journey , the penguins . So , I looked at Miguel . 
I said Miguel , &quot; Fly 240 kilometers to the farm . &quot; And fly them . Then 240 kilometers back to the evening 
. Make them do that for the kids . He 
looked at me as if it had just been a song of Whitney Houston quoted by me . 
He said , &quot; No . &quot; She says , &quot; You do that because the food is better . &quot; 
I have not the skin of my lover &apos;s fish mentioned . The delicious was . And I like no skin of fish . I like it , not sucked . I like it , not crispy . 
It &apos;s this biting , charred taste . 
I cook almost never with it . And 
yet , when I put it in this restaurant in southern Spain , I tried it at all , it didn &apos;t taste for fish skin . 
It tasted sweet and pure when it was like you had a bite from the ocean . 
I mentioned that to Miguel . And he nodded . 
He said , &quot; The skin looks like a sponge . 
&quot; She &apos;s the last defense before you have anything in your body that comes in . 
She has got herself over the course of evolution to develop impurities to suck up . And 
then he added , &quot; But our water has no impurities . Okay 
. A farm that has its fish not feeding . A farm that has its success measured by success in the success of its predators . 
&quot; And then it got to me . If it says , &quot; A farm that doesn &apos;t have impurities , it undermines enormously . &quot; Because that water , which goes through . These farms flow , comes from the river Guadalquivir , in . 
It &apos;s a river that has all of these things to do with it , which rivers today make for them to tend to do with them . Chemical pollutants , outflow of pesticides . 
And if it &apos;s going through the system , it &apos;s fought , and it &apos;s leaving , the water is cleaner than it &apos;s come in . 
That system is so healthy . It cleans the water . 
So , not only a farm that &apos;s cleaning its animals , it &apos;s not feeding their animals . It &apos;s not just a farm that &apos;s successful in health , but also in measuring its success in the predators &apos; health , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water treatment plant . And not only for these fish , but also for you , and me . 
Because if that water flows out , it sinks in the Atlantic , 
a drop in the ocean . I know , but I take it . And that should be you , too . Because these love stories , romantic , whatever , are also revealing . 
You could say that they &apos;re a recipe , for which they &apos;re good food for the future . Whether we &apos;re eating perch or meat cattle , 
what we &apos;re going to need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , of one in which food is actually good . 
But for many people , that &apos;s a little bit too radical . 
We &apos;re not realists . We enjoy . We &apos;re lovers . 
We love weekly markets . We love little family businesses . We talk about regional food . We eat . We eat organic , 
and if you claim that &apos;s the stuff that the future of good food insure . Is anyone somewhere on the rise and says , &quot; Hey guys , I love pink flamingos . &quot; But how are you going to make the world feed ? How 
are you going to feed the world ? 
Can I honestly be honest . 
I like these questions . Not . 
No . Not because we already have enough calories produced to make the world more than just to feed the world . 
A billion people are going to starve today , 
a billion . That &apos;s more than ever before . Because of stark inequalities in distribution , not the total production . 
Now , I like this question , not because it &apos;s the logic of our food system . The last 50 years , over the last 50 years , 
have determined that grain feed to vegetable eaters , pesticides , monocultures , chemicals , chicken to the Earth , fish . And the whole time , the whole agricultural industry has just asked . If we want more people to eat cheaper , how terrible can that be ? That 
was the reason . It was the justification . It was the business plan of the American agriculture . 
We should feed them what they call what they are . It was a liquidation industry , a business that quickly became ecological capital , which is exactly this production that allows . 
That &apos;s not a business . And it &apos;s not agriculture . 
Our grain chamber is now threatened , not because of decreasing supply , but because of decreasing resources , 
not by the latest Moravian and Tractor inventions , but by fertile land , not by pumps , but by fresh water . Not by chainsaws , but by forests . And not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea . They 
want to make the world feed . Let &apos;s 
let &apos;s start . Let &apos;s start with the question , &quot; How are we going to feed ourselves ? 
&quot; Or better . How can we create conditions that create any community that can empower itself to feed ? 
To do that , look at this , don &apos;t look at the agricultural industrial model for the future . 
It &apos;s really old . And it &apos;s done . 
Capital , chemistry and machines are in it . And it has never had anything really good to eat . 
Look at the way it &apos;s done , instead , the ecological model . 
That &apos;s the one that &apos;s on two billion years . Work experience . 
Look at it , Miguel . Farmers like Miguel , 
farms that don &apos;t create worlds for themselves , farms that restore . Instead of using up , farms that grow extensively instead of just intensive farmers , who not only are producers , but experts in relationships . 
Because they are the ones who are experts for taste , too . 
And if I really honestly am honest , they are a better cook . As I did ever be , 
they know , you know , that &apos;s right . Because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious . 
Thank you . 
I grew up with a lot of it . Science fiction . 
In my school days , I drove with the bus to school every day , an hour per way . And my 
nose stuck always in the same book , a science fiction book . That &apos;s my thoughts into other worlds that kidnapped me and narrated me . My deep into me , insatiable , insatiable curiosity satisfied me . 
These curiosity showed up as well in the fact that whenever I was not in the world of school , I was always straying through the woods , wandering and sampling , frogs and snakes and beetles and pond water . Everything after home brought home . And under the microscope , 
I looked at , &quot; I was totally . Science enthusiasts , 
you know , it always was about trying to get the world to understand and the limits of the possible 
, right ? And my love for science fiction . &quot; In my life , in my environment , it seemed to reflect . Because back then , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and we explored the deep sea . 
Jacques Cousteau came to our living rooms with his fascinating shows , which we had animals and places and a world and a world of wonders , which we had never seen before , we could never have imagined . 
This has then probably got very good at that . Science fiction role . 
And I was an artist . 
I could draw . I could paint . 
And there it was no video games , nor that saturation , with computer @-@ generated films . Nor the whole visual language in the media landscape was there , I had to take the pictures in my head . 
That had to be what we all had at the time . If we were kids , we had to read a book , we took the author &apos;s description and projected it onto the screen in our heads . 
My reaction to that was drawing . And painting of aliens was aliens alien worlds , robots , spacecraft . And all of that in math 
class became me all the time by the teacher , as I was hiding behind the textbook . 
So , painting around . The creativity had to stop somehow out . 
And in doing so , something interesting happened . What struck me about Jacques Cousteaus was shows that I was fascinated by the idea of a totally unknown world . Here , on our planet . Even certainly , 
I would never ever have an alien world with an spaceship , I would never reach . That seemed to me to be pretty unlikely . 
But here was a world that was me , actually , able to enter . Here , on Earth , and you were just as fascinating and exotic . Like all of that I was thinking about , what I always imagined . When I was reading these books , 
so I decided , When I was 15 , I diver to become . 
That only problem with this was that I was in a small village in Canada , in one thousand kilometers from the nearest ocean , 
Of which I left myself not , however , discouraged . 
I was annoyed by my father until he finally had a diving school in Buffalo , New York , found out . That &apos;s exactly the other side of the border where we lived . 
I made my diving certificate in a pool that was YMCA . Right in the middle of winter in Buffalo , New York , 
the ocean , but got a real ocean , I got to see only two years later . When we went to California 
since then , in the 40 years since , which have passed , I &apos;ve got about 3,000 hours under water underwater , and I &apos;ve been living in the ocean for a couple of years . 500 hours of that in submersible boats . 
And I &apos;ve learned that the world is the deep sea itself , even in the flatter oceans , so rich in fascinating life as we live it , really hard to imagine . The imagination of 
nature knows no one &apos;s limits . It &apos;s quite unlike our own imagination , miserable human imagination , 
up to this day , that it feels . I feel deepest awe for what I have to say on my dives . 
And my love of the ocean keeps on with the same intensity as ever . 
And ever since I was then , as an adult , a career , it was that filmmaking . 
That seemed to be the best way to make my inner urge to tell stories . With my need to take pictures , to combine them . 
When I was a kid , I was constantly drawing comic books . And so , 
so films were the way , pictures and stories were brought together . That fit together . 
Of course , the stories I was telling were the stories I chose from the science fiction field : Terminator , Aliens and Abyss . So 
at Abyss , I could share my preference for the underwater world and diving with the filmmaking , 
and I could combine that with the filmmaking . So I got a little bit like my two passions intertwined . 
Something interesting happened at Abyss to get a narrative problem in Abyss in this movie to solve . And that was , we had to sort of have a liquid water system . We took a computer @-@ generated animation , CG . 
What we found was the first one , computer @-@ generated soft surface figure ever to be seen in a movie . 
The film brought , though , no money . A very , very precise fact , it just played its production costs . But it was something fascinating that I noticed . This audience on the whole world . It was hypnotized by hypnotized magic of the magic that 
was going to come out of it . According to Arthur Clarke &apos;s law , as you know , advanced technology and magic are no longer to be distinguished from each other . 
They saw , then , something magical . 
And that was what I found incredibly exciting . 
And I thought , wow ! That has to be absolutely in the art of film . So 
they went to Terminator 2 . My next movie , my next movie , much further . 
Together with ILM , we created there the guy from liquid material , and we did it . The success was very much dependent on how this effect came about . 
And it worked . Again , we had something magical created . And the effect in the audience was the same . But there we have with the film already a little bit more money . 
We &apos;ve recorded from these two experiences , and from that two experiences , we &apos;ve achieved a whole new world . We &apos;ve achieved a whole new world of creativity for filmmakers . 
So , I started a company together with my good friend , Stan . Winston , who was at that time the best make @-@ up and creature designer , called Digital Domain . 
The basic idea of this company was to start the phase of analog processes with optical printers , etc . , and jump over to digital productions and start doing it . 
This was what we did , and we managed to create such a thing for a while , 
a competitive advantage . But in the mid @-@ 1990s , we realized that we had to be in the Creature and Character Design , for which we actually founded the company . And too 
slowly we were moving forward . I had this piece of Avatar written , which is the benchmark for visual effects and visual computer @-@ generated effects across the board , to be pushed to new heights . And with realistic , human expressive characters that are made using CG , And the main characters were to be all CG . And the world was to be CG . 
But the bar pressed very much . And the people in my company , they told me that we were still not in the company for the time being able to do that . 
So , I shifted that , and I did this other film about the big ship . 
That goes down to the studio , I have that as Romeo and Juliet on a ship , sold it . It became a love movie of epic proportions , a passionate film , secret 
. But did I actually want to become a real wreck ? The Titanic , dive 
down , that &apos;s why I made the film . 
That &apos;s the truth . That studio knew that , but it didn &apos;t . I have it , 
but I convinced it by saying , &quot; We dive to the wreck . &quot; We film that real wreck . 
We &apos;re going to do it in the opening sequence of the film . 
That &apos;s enormous , important . It &apos;s a good trailer for the marketing . And 
I persuaded them to make an expedition to finance it . 
Sounds crazy . But that can be done back to the fact that your imagination , a reality , 
can create . We created then actually six months . Six months later , a reality where I became a reality in a Russian submersible , four kilometers below the surface of the North Atlantic , and I found the real Titanic . Through a bullet , I looked at it . This was 
not a movie . It wasn &apos;t a HD . It was real . 
So , this has really bypassed me 
and the preparations for it were enormous . We had to have cameras and headlights and everything else . 
And I fell on how much I noticed these deep @-@ sea dive gears resembling a space mission . 
Well , yeah . They were also high @-@ tech and needed extensive planning . 
You go up into this capsule . Then you float in this dark dark , hostile environment , where there &apos;s no hope of salvation . If you do not , you don &apos;t get it back yourself . 
And I thought to myself , wow . That &apos;s the same as if I were in a science fiction movie . 
That &apos;s real cool . I 
was pretty obsessed . I was obsessed with exploring the deep sea . Anyway , 
of the part that &apos;s curious and science about exploring . It was all . It was adventure . It was curiosity . It was imagination . 
And it was an experience that was an experience that Hollywood didn &apos;t give me . 
Because , you know , I could get a creature for myself to imagine , and then we could create a visual effect . But I could get no idea what that was that I was outside the window , what I was going to see . 
And for some of the expeditions that followed , I &apos;ve got to see beings in thermal springs . And sometimes things that I still see before , things I &apos;d never seen before , sometimes things that nobody had ever seen before . And for those who have science to do at the time we saw it , none of the 
words found . That &apos;s what made me really wrong . And I wanted more . 
And so I met , then , a rather unusual decision . 
After that success of Titanic , I said to myself , Okay . I want to do my main job as a filmmaker in Hollywood on ice , and I &apos;m going to be a full @-@ time researcher for a while . And 
then they started to expeditions , and we started planning them . 
We showed up to Bismarck and we explored them with robotic vehicles . 
We returned to the wreck of the Titanic . 
We took little robots , which we built , that were a fiberglass cable . 
Our intention was to dive in and get inside of the ship and see what never before has been done . 
Nobody had ever had the inside of the wreck explored . You had another one , you had no means to do that . So they developed the necessary technology . 
So , what ? And there I am now sitting on the deck of the Titanic . In one submersible and I see planks planking these boards here , pretty much like this . And from those I know are the ones that the band used to play there . 
And I &apos;m flying with a little robot vehicle through the aisles of the ship . 
I &apos;m using it , actually , only . But my consciousness is within the body of the vehicle . 
It felt like it was like it was physically inside the vehicle wreck of the Titanic , inside the ship wreck . 
That was the surreal form of a déjà vu that I &apos;ve ever experienced . Because before I was around one of the corners , I knew I &apos;d always know what was going to happen in the light cone of the vehicle . And since I &apos;ve been running over the movie set for months , when we shot the film . 
That set was actually a precise set copy . The blueprints of the ship . 
That was , then , a very strange experience . 
It made me this telepresence experience aware that you could have such robotic avatars . And so , your own consciousness in that vehicle , into that other form of existence , Embark can 
it be . It was really incredibly profound , 
and maybe also a little bit of a view of what might be happening in a few decades . If you could have cyborg bodies to do some research or other things , or do it . In all sorts of post @-@ human future scenarios that I think I can imagine as a science fiction fan . 
After these expeditions , we started doing what we were down there , what we really appreciated , really appreciated . So for example , these deep @-@ sea equals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . This is sort of alien . But here on Earth . 
They live with the help of chemosynthesis . 
They exist not in a species that is based on sunlight , as we do . 
And so this is how you see animals right next to a 500 degrees Celsius water cloud , living right there . And 
you can imagine that you can &apos;t imagine them surviving there . So , 
at the same time , I was also very interested in space science . That was again the science fiction influence from my childhood . 
And so it landed with me , people who were interested in the space world , and people who were interested in NASA , and they were involved in it . And in the NASA expert council , they were sitting there planning real space missions . They were going to Russia , going through before the mission . That biomedical protocol , including the . Everything about it and flying on it , then to the International Space Station , and taking our 3D camera systems with them . 
That was fascinating . 
But on the end , it ran out of the way that I was going to be a space scientist with us into the deep sea . 
I was going to take them and I &apos;m going to give them access to the world . And down there , astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were working on these extreme situations . I was going to take them to the sources so they could look around , take samples and test instruments . And so on . 
We turned , well , documentaries were being made . But actually science , more specifically space science . 
So , this is how the circle between my existence as a science fiction fan , then as a child , closed . And the realization in the 
reality of this . In the course of this discovery journey , I learned a lot . 
I learned a lot about science . But I learned a lot about science , too . 
Now , think about leadership , I &apos;m sure , a director must be able to lead , be a guide , be a ship captain , or something like that . I understood , but 
I didn &apos;t understand much about leadership . Before I started these expeditions , 
because I was on a certain point , I had to tell myself , &quot; What am I doing here ? 
&quot; &quot; Why am I doing this ? &quot; &quot; What &apos;s coming out of this ? &quot; 
These stupid movies bring us no more money . 
We play some of the production costs , one of fame , no trace . 
Everybody thinks , &quot; I &apos;m between Titanic and Avatar , &quot; and I would have gone somewhere to get the nails on a towel on the beach . 
I &apos;ve all got these movies , these documentary films for a very small audience . 
No fame , no honor . No money . What are you doing ? 
You &apos;re doing it to do the job , to challenge the job . And the ocean is the most challenging environment that it has . You &apos;re doing it to explore the world . And you &apos;re doing it to discover the strange connection that emerges when a small group of people form a team . 
Because we have all of this with just 10 to 12 percent people , who have been doing continuous cooperation for years . Sometimes , we were two to three months in a row at sea . 
And in this community , you can see that the most important thing is respect , respect , that you have for each other , because you &apos;re done a task that you can &apos;t explain to anyone else . 
If you think about returning to land and saying , &quot; We had to do it . &quot; That fiberglass , the sound attenuation and the whole around it , the whole technology . And the difficulties , the human performance . If you look at sea , you can do that to the other , just don &apos;t explain . That &apos;s like working with policemen or policemen or soldiers who do something in common . And you know they do not ever have anybody to explain it . 
There &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect . 
When I was back , I came back to my next movie , Avatar , and I tried to apply the same leadership style , which is that you respect your team and in return deserve their respect . And that 
made the dynamics really change . 
And there I was again with the same little team , and I was on unknown terrain . We turned Avatar with an innovative new technology , which it used to be , and it didn &apos;t exist before . 
It was incredibly exciting , 
it was a tremendous challenge . 
And we became , for a period of four and a half years , a real family . 
And so this changed my way of making films . 
It changed completely . It changed people who thought we were going to have these ocean properties , really good at doing . And on the planet Pandora transports this . For 
me , it was more of a principled way to do my job . The real process of doing this is , as a result , changing . 
What can we do from all of this ? 
What lessons do we learn ? I think in the first place . 
Well , the first thing is curiosity . 
It &apos;s the most powerful human property . Our 
imagination is a force that is even a reality that creates a reality . 
And the respect for your team is more important than all laurels of this world . 
To me , young filmmakers come in and say , Give them me a advice on how I can do this kind of thing . And 
I say , &quot; Don &apos;t limit yourself , worry about it . 
&quot; Others are worried about you . &quot; Do not do it to you . &quot; &quot; Self bet , don &apos;t bet against yourself , but take risks , take risks . &quot; The 
NASA has this kind of favorite sentence . &quot; Failure is not an alternative . &quot; 
But in the arts and in the exploration , failure has to be an alternative . Because there , it guarantees a trust advance . 
No important undertaking . That innovation demanded was ever made without risk , and it was never tackled . 
You have to be ready . Such risks on 
your own . That &apos;s the idea that I thought to you with with , on the way to , you know . Failure is quite a way of thinking . Fear . But is not thank you . 
If I can tell you one thing today , I think it &apos;s that the whole of the data we consume is larger than the data we consume is the sum of their parts . And instead of doing that , instead of thinking about overloading information , I want you to think about how we use information in a way that gives rise to patterns , and we see trends that otherwise are not visible . 
So , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical death chart based on age . 
This program , which I &apos;m using here , is a little experiment . 
It &apos;s called Pivot . And what I &apos;m doing with Pivot is what I can do after a certain cause of death filter . Say , accidents 
and instantly , I see a different pattern , which is coming out . 
And that &apos;s because in the middle , here , people are the most active . And they &apos;re over here , the most frail . 
We can have a step further out and sort out the data , then rearrange it , and see that circulatory diseases and cancer , the usual suspects , are not for everybody . 
If we now go further and look at age , we say 40 years or younger or younger , we see accidents even affecting the main cause , about which the data is concerned , people should be worried . 
And who &apos;s going to go further , you see that this is particularly true for men . 
They recognize , therefore , that the reputation of information and data in this way is very much swimming in a swimming in a living information graph . 
And if we do this for raw data , why not ? Why not content itself , too 
. What we &apos;re doing here is , what we have the front covers . Everybody , every single Sports Illustrated , who has ever been printed . 
It &apos;s all here . It &apos;s all online . 
It &apos;s all online . You can test it after my talk in your rooms . 
With Pivot , you can dive into a decade . 
You can dive in , into , for a certain year . 
You can dive directly to , for a certain issue . 
If I &apos;m here to look , I see the athletes , who are in this issue . And the sports , 
I &apos;m a Lance . Armstrong @ arms.arms.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.arts.@@ Fan . So click on this , which is what all the expenses show me in which Lance Armstrong mentions Lance Armstrong . 
Now , if I just add one bigger overview , I could get to think . OK . What if I wanted to get all of this about cycling ? So 
I &apos;m going to take a step back and expand the perspective . 
Now , I &apos;m looking at Greg Lemon . 
And so this is how you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , more targeted , wider , more pure , zoom out . Then you look not for it or surf . You don &apos;t just surf . 
You just do something that is actually a little different . 
It &apos;s something in between . And we think it changes the way that you do it , the way that information can be used . 
I want to use this idea now a little bit further , with something like what a little crazy is . 
What we &apos;re doing here is what we &apos;ve got every single wikipedia page taken , and put it on a little summary . 
The summary contains a short overview of it and a symbol of the area from which it &apos;s coming . 
I &apos;m just going to show you the top 500 of the most popular wikipedia pages . 
But even in this limited view , you can see a lot of things we can do . 
Immediately , we get an idea of the issues that are on Wikipedia at the most popular level . 
I &apos;m going to move on to the government issue . 
Now , after I &apos;ve elected government , I realize that the Wikipedia categories that are on the most cover are Time Magazines , people of the year . 
This is really important . Because this is a realization that is not in a single individual Wikipedia page . 
This is just too recognizable . If you want to go one step back and look at the whole thing , 
look at a particular one . This summaries can be summarized in my perspective on Time Magazines , &quot; People of the Year , &quot; then . And everybody together 
sees when I see now all of these people , I see that I see that the majority of them are government officials . Some of them come from science . Some of them come from even less business . Here &apos;s my boss . And one comes from economics . 
And interestingly , Bono is also a TED Prize winner . 
So you can now jump and jump and take a look at all the TED Prize winners . 
You can see we surf the web . That &apos;s the first time it &apos;s as if it &apos;s really a web . Not only from side to side . But a lot more abstract . 
And so , I want to show you something else that a little surprise might be , actually . 
I &apos;m going to show you just the New York Times here , website . 
Pivot , this application . I want it not to be a browser . It &apos;s really not a browser . But you can do websites with it . And we bring these zoom technology to every single website , like this . 
I can , therefore , take a step back and go straight to a specific section . 
That &apos;s why it &apos;s important because you can only look through looking at websites in this way and look at them all over the Internet , and in the same way , look at them . 
I can , therefore , go back and zoom in into my course 
, in a certain time frame . Here &apos;s the state of play of the entire demonstration that I &apos;ve been holding up to this point . 
And I can sort of do everything I &apos;m doing today , what I &apos;ve seen . 
Again , bring back . And if I go back a step , and I go back and look at everything , I can retrace my course . Order maybe after my search past . Here &apos;s where I went for nepotistic . Here &apos;s Bing or Here &apos;s live . Labs Pivot And 
from here , I can go into the page and go in and call it again . 
It &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s always coming in and used . And every time it does that , it does the overall picture . Bigger than the sum of the data pieces 
at the moment , in this world . Think about it , data is a curse . 
We talk about it . Curse of the abundance of information . 
We talk about drowning in information . 
What if we could get this situation going and do the Internet on the head ? So , so we instead of always being led from one to the other , we start from many things to many things to many things to go . And by doing that , we can see patterns that would otherwise have been hidden . 
If we could do this , then it will be this data trap that we &apos;ve seen so far , maybe a new source of meaningful information . 
And instead of just just looking at information , instead of just moving around , we can get knowledge from it . 
And if we know , then then we can maybe even experience wisdom from it . 
So that &apos;s what I stop listening to . Thank you very much . 
Everybody talks today about the happiness of happiness . 
I have some people who have the number of books counting . The number of books published with happiness in the title over the last five years . And they gave up after about 40 , they gave up . And it was still a lot more . 
It &apos;s a huge wave of the interest in happiness among the researchers . 
It &apos;s very , very happy coaching . 
Everybody would like to see people happier . 
But despite all of this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps that make it kind of impossible , almost impossible . Sure about happiness , thinking about happiness . 
And my talk today is mostly going to be about these cognitive traps . 
That &apos;s true for laymen who are talking about their own happiness . And it &apos;s true for scientists who are talking about happiness . Because happiness turns out we &apos;re exactly the same mess as we are with everybody else . 
The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity . 
It turns out it &apos;s the same word happiness that &apos;s just not a useful word anymore . Because we &apos;re putting it on too many different things . 
I think it &apos;s a certain one meaning on which we apply it to , you know , a limited number of things . But in the big picture , by and large , that &apos;s something that we &apos;re going to have to give up . And we &apos;re going to take the complicated view . Suppose we have to take what well @-@ being is . 
The second case is a confusion . Of experience and memory . In fact , it &apos;s between happiness , being happy in his life and being happy about his life or being happy with his life . 
And this is two very different , very different concepts . And they &apos;re both thrown together in the idea of happiness , in the idea of happiness . 
And the third is happiness illusion of concentration . And that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that the fact is that we don &apos;t think about a circumstance . The well @-@ being affects without its meaning distorting . 
I mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive trap . 
It &apos;s just not a way . It &apos;s right to get it right . 
Now , I &apos;d like to talk to you about an example of someone who had a question and answer session . After a one of my lectures , which told a story , it was unclear . He said , he had a symphony heard . And it was absolutely magnificent music . And it was at the very end of the recording , there was a terrible , creeping sound . 
And then he added , &quot; Really , quite emotional . &quot; That &apos;s what all the experience ruined . 
But that had it not , which 
it ruined . The memories of the experience were . 
He had the experience . 
He had 20 minutes of wonderful music . 
They counted not because he had a great memory . The memory was ruined . And the memory was everything that was he had to keep to . 
What we had really told us is that we talked about ourselves and about others , about us , about us . In the sense of two kinds of self . 
It &apos;s a living self that exists in the present , living in the present . And the present knows how capable it is of rebuilding the past . But in fact , only the present has 
it , it &apos;s the living self , the doctor instigates . It &apos;s the living self that the doctor instigates . You know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Is it hurting now ? &quot; When I ask you to touch you here . And 
then there &apos;s a reminder . And that reminiscent self is that reminiscent self that &apos;s withering . And the story of our lives , maintaining . And it &apos;s that that that &apos;s the doctor &apos;s talking about by asking the question . How did you feel in the last few 
days ? Or how was your journey to the Albania or something like that ? 
This is two very different units . This living self . And this remembering self . And the two to be confused is part of the unity of the term &quot; happiness . 
&quot; Now , the remembering self is a storyteller . 
And that starts really with a real fundamental reaction to our response to our memories . It starts immediately . 
We tell not only stories . When we think about it , stories become stories . 
Our memory tells us stories . That means what we &apos;re talking about from our experiences is what we &apos;re allowed to keep is a story . 
And let &apos;s not be surprised with an example . 
It &apos;s a old study . 
That &apos;s real patients , who are one of the patients who undergo painful procedures . 
I &apos;m not going to go into detail . You know , it &apos;s no longer painful today . But you know , it was painful . When these studies were done in the 1990s , 
they became real patients , and they were asked to report their pain every 60 seconds . And 
here &apos;s two patients . That &apos;s their records . 
And they &apos;re asked , who of both has more suffered from both ? And 
that &apos;s a very simple one . 
Patient B has clearly more suffered from this . His intestinal reflection was longer . And each minute of pain . The patient @ a had patient # b and more . 
But now there are a different one : How much did you think ? These patients think they suffered ? And 
here &apos;s a surprise . And 
the surprise is that patient is @ a , much worse reminder of patient # a of intestinal reflection . When patient # b had 
the stories of intestinal reflections , different . And because a very critical part of the story is how a very critical part of the story ends . 
And no one of these stories is very edible or great . But one of them is this one that is clear . But one of them is clear . Worse than the other is , 
and the one that is worse was where where the pain was all about to end up at its peak . It &apos;s a bad story . 
Where do we know that ? 
Because we have these people after they &apos;re being shown in their intestinal reflections , and much later . How bad was that ? The whole thing ? And 
they were a lot worse for A than for B than for B in memory . 
Now , that &apos;s a direct conflict between the survivor himself , and the remembering . Even 
from the perspective of the survivor himself , B had clearly a worse time . 
Now , what you do with patient A was , you know ? And we have actually clinical experiments . And it &apos;s done . And it works . You could actually do the intestinal reflection of patient A by extending it simply by just putting the tube inside . Without going too much into it , too much . 
That &apos;s going to make it happen that the patient suffers , but only a little bit less than before . 
And if you do that a few minutes , you have a few effects on the effect that the living self of patient A gets worse off . And you have a effect on the memory self of patient , patient A , getting much better off . Because now , you have patient A , getting a better story about your experience . 
What makes you draw a story from ? 
And that &apos;s true of the stories that the memory tells us . And it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent . 
What makes a story unique is that upheavals are significant moments and ends . 
End is very , very important . And in this case , the dominant end was end . 
Now , the living self lives its life continuously . 
It has moments of experience , a moment after moment . 
And they ask what happens to what happens to these moments ? 
And the answer is really simple : They &apos;re for ever lost . 
I mean , most moments of our lives . And I have that calculated . They know , the psychological present is considered to be about three seconds long . What does knowledge mean ? Do you know that in a life it &apos;s about 600 million of them . In a month , there &apos;s about 600 000 . The majority of them leave no left with any trace . 
The majority of them will be completely ignored , by the memory self . 
And yet , they somehow get the impression that they count , they should . That what &apos;s going on during these moments of experience . Our lives are 
it . It &apos;s the limited resource that we consume while we &apos;re on this world . 
And it &apos;s how we consume it that would seem to be important . But that &apos;s not the story , the story that the memory self is keeping for us . 
So , we have the memory self . And that living self . And you &apos;re really pretty different . 
The biggest difference between you is that you deal with time , 
from the point of view of the living . Even if you &apos;re on vacation , and you &apos;re on a second week just as good as the first week . Then there &apos;s the two @-@ week holiday twice as good as the one @-@ week holiday . So 
that &apos;s how it doesn &apos;t work at all . It doesn &apos;t work for the memory self , 
for the memory self , a two @-@ week holiday is hardly better than a one @-@ week holiday . Because there &apos;s no new memories added to that . 
They have the story , not changed . 
And on those terms , time is actually the critical variable , the critical variable , which distinguishes a memory self from a living self . Even time has very little influence on a memory self . 
Now , the memory self makes more than just remembering and remembering stories . 
It &apos;s actually the one . That decision @-@ making is made . Because if you make a patient , he says , &quot; We have two intestinal reflections in two different surgeons , and he decides which one to choose . &quot; Then it &apos;s the one who chooses who chooses the one who has the memory that &apos;s less bad . And that &apos;s the surgeon who has chosen to be selected . 
That survivor himself has no voice , in this choice . Actually , 
we don &apos;t choose between experiences . We choose between memories of experiences , 
And even if we think of experiences in the future , we think of our future , usually not as experiences . 
We think about our future , about our foreseeable memories . 
And in fact , you can do that . You know , as a tyranny of remembering self . And you can do that remembering memento yourself . As one , think of yourself . That , so to speak , drags the living self through experiences that the living self doesn &apos;t need . 
I have the impression that if you think about vacation , that &apos;s very often the case , very often . That means we do vacation as much as possible in the service of the memory self . 
And that &apos;s a little hard , to justify , I think . 
I mean , how much do we feed on our memories ? 
That &apos;s a one of the explanations that are used for dominating the memory self . 
And if I talk about that , I think about a vacation that we &apos;re going to spend a few years ago in Antarctica , which is clearly the best vacation we &apos;ve ever had in Antarctica that I &apos;ve ever had . And I think relatively often about that in relation to how much time I think about other vacations , in relation to that . 
And I &apos;ve probably heard about my memories of these three @-@ week trips . I would say something like 25 minutes for about 25 minutes in the last four years . 
Now , if I ever had the folder opened , with the 600 images in it , I would have another hour spent . 
Now , these are three weeks . And that &apos;s at most . One and a half hours . 
There seems to be disagreement there . 
Now , I like a little bit extreme . You know , in that , how little appetite do I have for feeding memories ? But even if you have more of that , there &apos;s a real question . Why do we give memories so much weight in the lurch ? To the weight we give experiences . 
So I want me to tell you about a thought experiment . 
So , imagine your next vacation . You know that on the end of the vacation , all your images are destroyed . And you get a amnesty drug . So you get yourself an amnesty drug , so you don &apos;t remember anything . 
Now , you would have the same vacation . And if you had another vacation , you would have a different vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two kinds of self . And you have to think about how you &apos;re going to decide this conflict . And that &apos;s really , really not obvious at all . Because if you &apos;re going to be in the sense of time , you get an answer . And if you &apos;re in the sense of memory , you could think of another answer , you could get a different one . 
Why we &apos;re going to choose the vacations we choose ? A problem that &apos;s going to confront us with a choice between the two species of the self . 
Now , the two types of self are throwing two terms from happiness : 
It &apos;s actually two concepts of happiness : The ones we apply to happiness , one per self . 
They can , therefore , ask how happy is the living self ? 
And then they would ask , how happy are the moments of happiness in the life of the living self ? 
And they are all happiness . For moments , a pretty complicated thing to do . 
What are the emotions that are measured ? What are the emotions that can be measured ? 
And by the way , we are now able to have a pretty good idea . From happiness to happiness of the living self over time . 
When you look after happiness from happiness to memory self , it &apos;s a very different matter . 
That &apos;s not about how happy it is . A person lives . 
It &apos;s about how satisfied or how pleased it is . The person is when this person is informed about his or her life . 
Very different . 
( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) And I belong to a lot of people who are researching well @-@ being , who are researching happiness long overshadowed by it . On the very same way , 
the distinction between happiness , happiness , happiness , happiness , the living self . And that happiness , the memory self , is in the last few years recognized . And now , you &apos;re trying to make the two separate measurements . 
The Gallup Organization has a global organization survey of happiness , where more than half a million people ask questions . About that , what they &apos;re talking about about their lives and about their experiences . And it &apos;s been other efforts in the direction . 
In the last few years , we &apos;ve started to think about happiness in the two species of self . 
And the main lesson that we have , I think , learned is that they really do vary . 
They can know how satisfied someone is with their lives . And that teaches them really , really doesn &apos;t teach them much about how happy he lives his life . And vice versa . 
Only to give you an idea of the correlation to the correlation . The correlation is about five percent . 
What that means is that if you &apos;re somebody you would meet and you would meet them , &quot; Oh , his father is a two @-@ meter man . &quot; How much would you know about his height ? 
Well , you would know about his size . But it &apos;s a lot of uncertainty . 
You have that much uncertainty . 
If I give you a message that someone has his life as eight on a scale of 10 , classified his life as eight . Have you got a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self ? 
The correlation is therefore low . 
We know something about what the correlation is about happiness self happiness . 
We know that money is very important , very important . Targets are very important . 
We know that happiness is mostly about happiness , being satisfied with people who we like , time to spend , time to people we like , 
right ? It &apos;s other pleasure . But that &apos;s dominant . 
If you &apos;re doing happiness , then , for the two kinds of self to maximize . Will you be at the end of the day doing very different things ? The conclusion from 
the conclusion of what I said here is that what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re really not supposed to imagine happiness as a substitute for well @-@ being . 
It &apos;s a complete different term , 
right ? Well , very briefly . A different reason for that is why we don &apos;t know clearly about happiness is that happiness is not something we &apos;re not thinking about . If we think about life , we &apos;re thinking about life , and if we actually live . 
If you think about simple questions , then , how happy are people in California ? Will they not be the correct answer ? 
If they &apos;re going to ask that question , do they think people in California are happier than they are ? If they say , &quot; We &apos;re living in Ohio . 
&quot; And what happens is that if you &apos;re talking about life , in California , think about life , think about the difference between California and other places . And this difference is , say , in climate . 
Now , it turns out that it &apos;s climate not very important for climate to the living self . And it &apos;s not even very important , even for the thoughtful self . That &apos;s what determines how happy people are . 
Now , because that thoughtful self is responsible , the thoughtful self can eventually . Some people might be able to end up moving to California . 
And it &apos;s kind of interesting to track . What happens to people who are looking for California , in the hope of being happier ? 
Well , their living self won &apos;t be happier . 
We know that . 
But one thing is going to happen . You &apos;re going to think you &apos;re happier . Because if you talk about that , you &apos;re reminded that you &apos;re terrible about the weather in Ohio , Ohio . And you &apos;re going to feel you &apos;re the right choice . 
It &apos;s very difficult , clear about well @-@ being . And I hope I have to tell you an idea of that , how difficult it is . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question for you . 
Thank you . 
Well , when we started thinking a few weeks ago , when we were talking to you , you told me that it was a pretty interesting result that came from this Gallup survey . 
Is that something that you told us about ? Because you &apos;re now going to have a few minutes left . 
Daniel Kahneman : Sure . 
I think the most interesting result we have in the Gallup survey is that the most interesting result we &apos;ve found is a number that we absolutely didn &apos;t expect to find . 
We found that in terms of the number of happiness of the survivor himself . 
If we look at how feelings are related to income vary , 
and it &apos;s up to us that among a group income of 60 000 , 000 dollars a year , Americans . And that &apos;s a very large , big sample of Americans , about 600 , 000 . But it &apos;s a big representative of sample among a income sample of 600 , 000 dollars in a year . 
CA : 60,000 . 
DK : 60 . 
000 . 60 . 000 . Dollar . IM : Year is the unfortunate thing . And they &apos;re getting increasingly unhappy . JE : The poorer they get about 
it , we get an absolutely flat line . 
I mean , I rarely have that flat line seen . 
What happens is obviously that money is giving you no experience of happiness . But that lack of money gives you a certain amount of misery . And we can get this misery very , very clearly measured . 
In the sense of the other , even the remembering self , you get a different story . 
The more money you make , the more satisfied you are . 
That &apos;s not true of emotions . 
CA : But Danny , throughout the American endeavor , it &apos;s about life , freedom . That aspiration for happiness . 
If people want to be serious about this finding , I mean , it all seems to be upside down . Everything that we believe to be , for example , in tax policy . And so on and so forth , 
there &apos;s an opportunity for politicians to see that the country generally has a finding like taking seriously . And that &apos;s what politics would be based on . 
DK : You know ? I think that it &apos;s recognition . There &apos;s recognition for the role of gambling research in politics . 
The recognition is slowly going to be . In the United States , no question . But in the United Kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now . And in other countries , it &apos;s happening right now . The 
people are in the process of recognizing that they think of happiness . If you think about politics , 
it &apos;s going to take a while . And it &apos;s going to be people who will discuss whether they want to explore experience happiness , or whether they want to explore life assessment . So , we need to really have this discussion very soon , 
how to increase happiness . So , if you go in very different ways . Depending on how you think . And whether you think about the memory self , or whether you think about the living self , or whether you think about the living self . 
That &apos;s what politics is going to be . It &apos;s what I think . In the coming years , 
in the United States , you &apos;re going to be tightening on the happiness of the people . 
That &apos;s going to be , I think , in the next decade or two , part of the national statistics . 
CA : Well , it seems to me , this is a subject that &apos;s going to , or should , be at least the most interesting political debate to follow . About the next few years . 
Thank you very much . For the invention of behavioral economics . 
Thank you . Danny Kahneman : Today 
I &apos;m speaking to you about energy and climate . 
And that &apos;s perhaps a surprise , because my full @-@ time job at the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds , about things that are the things that we invent and deliver , about the poorest two billion , about a better life . 
But energy and climate are extremely extreme , very important for these people . It &apos;s actually even more important than any other person on the planet . 
Climate degradation means that their seeds are above all the seeds that will not grow for many years , we &apos;re too much or too little rain . The things will change that way . Their fragile environment will not endure . 
That leads to starvation . It leads to insecurity . It leads to unrest . 
So it becomes climate change terrible for them , And it &apos;s 
also the energy price for them that matters very much . 
The fact is , if you only talk about one thing , the price could be reduced . So to reduce poverty , energy would be by far the most effective . 
Now , the energy price is above time gone . In fact , 
the progress society is based on energy progress . 
The coal evolution drove industrial revolution , the industrial revolution . And even in the 20th century , there was a rapid fall in the electricity price . And that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , air conditioning . We can use modern materials and we can make so many things . 
We &apos;re in the middle of a wonderful situation , with electricity in the rich world , in the rich world . 
But if we do the price down , we let ourselves be reduced by half the price . Meet the price . Come across a new barrier . And these barrier hangs with CO2 , and that barrier is connected . 
CO2 warms up the planet and the equation for CO2 is the actual amount of clarity . 
It &apos;s adding up the CO2 that &apos;s emitted , which leads to temperature increases . And these temperature increases have some very negative consequences : Effects on the weather . And maybe worse , indirect effects , that the natural ecosystems are changing so rapidly , such rapid changes , can &apos;t adapt . And so whole systems collapse . 
Now , the exact connection between a CO2 increase and the resulting carbon change and where that change continues to follow , is what it means . Because there are some ambiguities . But not very many . 
And there are certainly ambiguities about that , how bad these consequences will be . But they will be extremely bad . 
I have the top scientists asked several times , &quot; Do we really have to get down to near zero ? 
&quot; Is that enough ? Not enough . Half . Or a quarter . 
The answer is , until we get near zero . Will the temperature keep rising ? That &apos;s 
why it &apos;s a big challenge . 
It &apos;s quite different from what it &apos;s to say , &quot; We have a three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ foot truck coming down a three @-@ foot bridge . &quot; The one can do that , you can squeeze it down below 
. That &apos;s what needs to be downward @-@ down to zero . 
Now , we hit zero every year a lot of carbon dioxide , over 26 billion tons . 
Every American , about 20 tons of people from poor countries , less than one on average , 
it &apos;s about five tons for each one on the planet . 
And somehow , we need to create changes that can bring that down to zero . 
It &apos;s been constant up to 
now . Only different economic ones . Changes have made it affect at all . And we need to be affected by rapid growth to reduction and to a reduction to a reduction to zero . 
These equations have four factors . One bit of multiplication . They have this thing on the left , CO2 , that they bring to zero . And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen by the number of people , by the services that every human being uses on average , the average energy for every service and the CO2 per unit of energy emitted . 
Let &apos;s let &apos;s therefore take every factor individually . And think about how we can do that to zero . 
Probably , a factor of these numbers has to be very close to zero . 
Now , this is basic algebra . But let &apos;s go ahead and go through it . 
First of all , we have the population today . 
Six to eight billion people , 
and it &apos;s going to reach nine billion , 
which is going to go to nine billion . If we &apos;re very successful in new vaccines , healthcare and new reproductive medicine . Could we do that , maybe by 10 to 15 percent ? But to date , we &apos;re seeing a climb of 1.3 percent . 
The second factor is the services . That includes 
all of the food , the food we eat , clothing , television , heating . 
That &apos;s very good things . And poverty reduction means these services almost to everybody on the planet accessible to everyone . 
It &apos;s great that these numbers are rising up 
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might think we could make cuts and use less . But in average , this number is going to increase every year , and so overall , it &apos;s more than doubling . The number of services that are available per person per person . 
Here &apos;s what we see is a very basic service . Is there a home light to light up so you can read the homework ? 
And these students have it not . So , they go out and read their homework under the school light . 
Now , effectiveness , the E , the energy per service gives you finally good news . 
We have something that &apos;s not going up . 
Because of different successes in the lighting sector , through other types of cars , through new building methods . It &apos;s got a lot of services that you &apos;re able to drastically reduce your energy consumption . It &apos;s going to be able to drastically reduce your energy consumption . 
103.00 , 05.50,000 GT , 00.05.53,000 . Some services leave you with 90 percent reduction . Some individual services leave you with 90 percent reduction . 
Some services in other services , like manufacturing fertilizers , can reduce your energy consumption by 105 , 00.05.56,000 GT , 00.05.58,000 GT , or air transport or air transport , and the room for improvement is much smaller overall . 
If we &apos;re optimistic , we get maybe a reduction of the amount by a factor of three , or maybe even a factor of six . 
But when it comes to the first three factors , we &apos;re now 26 billion . Maybe the very best 13 billion tons . And that &apos;s just not enough . Look at 
the first three factors , the fourth factor . And this one will be a key factor . That &apos;s the amount of CO2 that &apos;s per unit of energy . 
It &apos;s emitted . It represents itself the question of whether you can do that to zero . 
If you &apos;re burning coal , no , 
if you &apos;re burning natural gas , no , 
almost every method of producing electricity emits . Nowadays , CO2 , except renewable energy , nuclear energy . 
So what we &apos;re doing on a global scale has to be a new system to 
create , right ? We need energy under . 
If I &apos;m going to use the term &quot; wonder , &quot; I don &apos;t mean the impossible . 
The microprocessor is a miracle . The PC is a miracle , 
the Internet and its services are a miracle , 
right ? The people here have a miracle to develop many of these miracles . 
Normally , there are no deadline for you to do a miracle up to a certain date . 
Normally , you &apos;re just standing next to it . And some people come not . In 
this case , we have to do full gas . And a miracle in very short order of time . 
Now , I wondered , how can I do that really ? 
Is there a natural illustration ? Is there a demonstration that illustrates the idea of the people here ? 
I remembered . Last year , when I brought mosquitos and somehow liked the mosquitos , people liked that . 
The idea became for them really , really tangible . You know , it &apos;s human beings who have mosquitos living 
with , for energy , fell . I did this here . 
I decided that this was the release of fireflies , my contribution this year to the environment , here . Here are 
, then , some natural fireflies . 
You have me been assured that they &apos;re not biting . In fact , they &apos;re not even going to leave the glass . 
Now , there are all kinds of game solutions like this . But they bring all of them not much . 
We need solutions . Either one or more of them , which are an unimaginable scale and unimaginable reliability . And though it has many directions , in which people are looking for it , I really only see five of them looking for these big challenges . 
I have tides , geothermal fusion and biofuels omitted . 
These are perhaps doing a moderate contribution . And if you do better than you do , I expect that would be great . But my key message here is that we are working on all those five . And we can &apos;t do any of them because they give up because they intimidate us . Because everybody has significant problems . 
Look at them first . That &apos;s burning fossil fuels . Burning fossil fuels , burning either coal or natural gas . 
What you &apos;re doing there seems to be easy . But that &apos;s it . You &apos;d have to take all the CO2 that &apos;s coming out of the chimney after you burn it , under pressure , liquefied . And then somewhere somewhere , and hope that it &apos;s there to stay . 
It &apos;s got some pilot projects that can do that on a 60 @-@ 80 level , but it &apos;s got to get to 100 . Very difficult things will be , and it &apos;s going to be an agreement on the storage of CO2 , and it &apos;s a big challenge . But that &apos;s the biggest problem here is the storage time issue . 
Who &apos;s going to make sure ? 
Who can make sure something is guaranteed ? What literally many billions of times larger than any kind of thing waste , you can afford from nuclear and other nuclear and other things . 
That &apos;s a lot of volume . That &apos;s 
so , a hard nut . So 
next , nuclear energy 
, which has three major problems . The cost before all , especially in highly regulated countries , is high . The question of safety is that you really feel that nothing is wrong . Despite the human collaboration , that the fuel is not for weapons , that it &apos;s not used . And what does you 
do with that ? What do you do with the waste ? 
Because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concern . The 
people have to be good at that . 
184 : 00 10 20 000 GT 00 10 25 000 GT 00 10 25 000 . So three very difficult problems . The ones that may be solvable , three very difficult problems . The ones that may be solvable and where you can work on that . 
The last three of the five have been summarized . It &apos;s 
the renewables . It &apos;s the renewables , as they &apos;re often called . 
And it &apos;s the renewables that have , although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel . They have some disadvantages . So 
one is that energy density is the energy density that these technologies generate dramatically lower than that of power plants . 
That &apos;s low @-@ energy . You talk about many square kilometers , thousands of times more space than a normal power plant . And 
also , these sources are interruptions . 
The sun shines not the whole thing all day . They shines also not every day , not every day . And just as blows blows the wind . Not constantly . So that &apos;s 
why , if you &apos;re from these sources , you have to have a way to use energy even in times . If you &apos;re not available , if it &apos;s not available , you get it . 
It &apos;s here , so there &apos;s big price challenges . It &apos;s there challenges in transmission . If we , for example , say that the energy source outside the country is not , you don &apos;t just need technology . You need to also use the risk to run the energy supply from where else comes from . 
And it &apos;s there that storage problem . 
And to do that , to show the dimension , I &apos;ve looked at all kinds of batteries . The ones that are made are looking at cars , computers , mobile phones , flashlights for everything . And that &apos;s what I did with the amount of electronic energy that the world uses to use . I found out that everybody &apos;s batteries , the batteries that we &apos;re now producing , are all of them . Less than 10 minutes of total energy storage 
could be . We need to have a big , big breakthrough here , something that &apos;s about a factor 100 , will be better than the approaches at the moment . 
That &apos;s not impossible . But it &apos;s not that easy . 
That &apos;s what happens when you try to try and tell these interrupted sources about . We 20 , 30 percent of consumption , right ? When you get around 100 
percent of that , you need 100 percent of the battery , you need an incredible wonder . 
Now where are we going to go ? What is the right approach ? 
A Manhattan project . How do we get to the finish line ? 
What do we need is a lot of companies . The ones that work on it . Hundreds of people 
in each of these five areas need at least 100 people . 
At many , they will say , &quot; They &apos;re crazy . &quot; That &apos;s good . 
I think here in the TED TED . Group gives us a lot of people who are already engaged . 
Bill Gross has several companies under the leadership of one of them , Esolar . The great solar thermal technologies have 
Vinod Khosla invested in dozens of companies . The great things are doing and interesting opportunities have . And I &apos;m trying to support that . 
Nathan Myhrvold and I are funding a company that might surprisingly , surprisingly , be pursuing a nuclear approach . 
It &apos;s got some innovations in the nuclear field : Modular , liquid . 
The development has been very successful in this industry some time ago . So , it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are lying around . That Terrapower concept means you 
&apos;re going to replace part of the uranium that you &apos;re going to be one percent . That U235 : We decided the 99 to burn . That U238 . That 
&apos;s a pretty crazy idea . 
But actually , you had about it for a long time . But you could never make sense of simulating whether it would work . But since it became modern supercomputers , it &apos;s been possible to simulate it and see that yes , with the right approach to matter , it looks like it works . 
And because you can do 99 percent of this , the cost profile is much better . In fact , 
you burn the garbage , and you can even burn the garbage from today &apos;s reactors . 
When you &apos;re using it as a drive , rather than breaking your head , you just burn it . A great thing . 
That uranium is gradually consumed . A little bit like a candle . 
You can see that it &apos;s kind of a column . Often , as a wandering wave , it 
&apos;s called a reactor . That triggers really . That problem with fuel . 
Here &apos;s a picture of a place in Kentucky . 
That &apos;s the waste that &apos;s 99 . You have the part of the one that &apos;s burned today . You have taken it out . So it says , &quot; depleted uranium . 
&quot; That drives the U.U. &apos; s for hundreds of years to come . 
And if you want to buy ocean water cheaply and simply filter , you get enough fuel for the rest . Life of the planet . 
You know , there &apos;s still a lot of challenges . But it &apos;s a case of example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward , hundreds of concepts . 
Think about it . How do we make our success measured ? 
How should our testimony look ? 
Well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to achieve . And then talk about the goal , 
the intermediate step . A lot of people talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 . 
It &apos;s really , really important that we get there , 
the rest of the 20 percent . In poor countries , we &apos;re going to be producing , and we &apos;re still producing , some agriculture . Hopefully , forest threats and cement will be clean by then . 
So , to get this 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like China , needs to completely transform their generation of electricity . 
The other note says whether we can change zero emissions technology . Whether they &apos;re in all developed countries , whether they &apos;re in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to getting them to the 
rest . That &apos;s great . 
That &apos;s going to be a key element . This certificate , if we 
get from there , when we go back . How should that be 
a 2020 certificate ? It should be the two elements again . 
We should be the ones that use the effectiveness measures to get reduction going . The less we emit , the less we emit , the lower the amount of CO2 . And so , too , the temperature . 
But actually , this note is for the things that we do . The things that we don &apos;t do completely , which lead to the big reductions , are just equal or even slightly less important than the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs . 
These breakthroughs need to be fully gas @-@ tracked . And that can be measured . In company numbers , in pilot projects and regulatory changes . 
It &apos;s got a lot of great books on this subject . 
That Al Gore book . We have the choice and David Gore &apos;s Sustainable Energy Without . They go it 
really through and they can create a framework in which this is widely discussed . Because we need to have support from everybody to do that . 
It &apos;s got a lot . There &apos;s a lot to come together . 
It &apos;s got to be a wish . 
It &apos;s a very concrete wish that we can invent this technology . 
If you tell me just one wish for the next 50 or so years . I could give the president a choice : A vaccine , and that &apos;s what I love . I , or I , could choose that wish . The one is halved energy price . Without CO2 , it &apos;s invented . It &apos;s what I would take that 
wish . It &apos;s the biggest impact . If we take that wish , 
if we don &apos;t get that , the gap between long @-@ term and short @-@ term thinking will be . People , terrible , will be between the United States and China , between poor and rich countries . And almost all live in these two billion , and a lot worse will 
be . What do we have to do ? So 
what measures do I appeal for ? 
We have to work for more research funding . 
If countries are to be in places like coppenhages , they should not only be meeting on CO2 . 
They should be talking about this innovation strategy . And they would be shocked by the ridiculous low money that they spend on these innovative approaches . 
We need market incentives . We need carbon taxes . CAP &amp; amp ; Trade : Something that sends a price signal . 
We need to get the message across . 
We need dialogue , more rational and complete . And we also need to have the things that the government is doing . 
It &apos;s a very important wish . But I think we can do it , but I think we can . 
Thank you very much . 
Thank you very much . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . Thank you . 
Thank you . Thank you very much . Just to get a little better at understanding Terrapower . First of all , you can give us an idea . The scale of this investment is Bill 
Gates to give us the simulation on a supercomputer to do . Everybody big scientists to get what they &apos;re doing , what we &apos;ve done . Do we just need a few 10 million ? And even if we &apos;re using our materials in a Russian reactor to test our materials to make sure it works reasonably , you &apos;re only in the 100s , million . 
The difficult step is that building is the first reactor , building another billion to find . The regulations and the place of the actual reactor , the first one to build . 
Once the first one is finished , when it &apos;s running the way it promised , then everything is clear . Because the economy , the energy density , is so different from nuclear energy as we are . 
It &apos;s about about about that right , to understand . That means deep into the ground . Almost like a vertical column of nuclear fuel , that consumed uranium . And then it starts the process . Up there , it continues to work down . 
BG : Exactly today , you have to always reconnect the reactor . So there &apos;s a lot of people and lots of controls that go wrong . This thing , where you open it and things in or inside it or out . This is not good . 
If you do , however , very cheap fuel , you can use it for 60 years . Think about it . A column that you bury without the need to cover all the complexities . 
And it sits there and it burns 60 years for . And then it &apos;s done . 
CA : A nuclear reactor that itself can find a solution to the garbage . 
BG : Yeah . Now , what about the garbage that happens ? You can do it sit it . It &apos;s got much less garbage . It &apos;s a method that you use , and then you take it and you pack it . In the next reactor and you burn it further . 
And we start by starting by putting the garbage that &apos;s already in existence , which is in these refrigerators or dry tanks at the reactors . That &apos;s our starting fuel . So that &apos;s 
what we think about these reactors as a problem that was what we were doing in our fill . And so this is going to dramatically reduce the volume of waste . While this process is going on , about , 
but as you &apos;re working with different people in the world on these possibilities . 
Where is this ? The greatest interest . So what really is going to happen ? 
BG : Well , we still have not focused on one place . And it &apos;s a lot of interesting disclosure rules for everything that &apos;s nuclear in the name . It &apos;s big interest . And the people of the company were in Russia , India , China . I was here , and I have the Energy Minister , and I &apos;ve been talking about how this fits into the energy agenda . 
I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the French and Japanese have something in their minds in the direction . 
This is a variant of one thing . The one that was done . 
The one is an important step forward . But it &apos;s like a quick @-@ reaction engine . And some countries have these built these . That &apos;s why anyone who &apos;s building a quick @-@ reaction reactor is a candidate for our first one . 
CA : In your imagination , timeframe and probability , this is really what you think you &apos;re going to be doing . 
BG : Well , we need one of these scalable , power @-@ generating things that is very cheap . We have 20 years to invent . And then 20 years to deploy . 
That &apos;s kind of the deadline , which is the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet . 
And you know , Terrapower ? If everything is going well and that &apos;s a big wish , you know ? Could that be 
easy ? And fortunately , there are dozens of people today . And we need hundreds of people who are the same . If they &apos;re starting to work , promoting them . Pilots work for that , they can offer them . 
And it would be best if they could have multiple . Because then , you could create a mix . You could use a mix . In any case , 
we need a solution . 
CA : Concerning the big , possible breakthroughs , this is the biggest thing you know . 
BG : An energy break is the most important thing . 
That would be it without the energy challenge . But the power is still doing that much more , much more importantly , 
in the nuclear sector . Is there any other innovative companies ? Do 
you know , we know about their work not as well as these ? But it &apos;s the modular method that exists . That &apos;s a different approach . 
It &apos;s a liquid reactor type that has a little bit of a difficulty . But maybe you &apos;re saying that about us . 
And so there &apos;s different ones . But that &apos;s nice about it is that a uranium molecule , a million times as much energy . How a guy , let &apos;s say , has a carbon molecule . And that &apos;s why , if you &apos;re dealing with the problems , you can . And the problems are mainly radiation . The footprint . And the cost is playing the potential . So , the impact on the land and other things , almost in one &apos;s own league . 
CA : If that doesn &apos;t work , what 
do we have to do is take emergency measures to try and stabilize the Earth &apos;s temperature ? 
BG : If you &apos;re in this situation , it &apos;s like it &apos;s like you &apos;re eating too much . And for a moment before a heart attack , it &apos;s about to happen . What &apos;s you doing ? You need , maybe , a heart surgery or something like that . 
It &apos;s got a research that &apos;s going on called geoengineering , which is going to look at different techniques to make warming delayed , so we can 20 or 30 years longer to get ourselves together . 
That &apos;s just one insurance method . 
You hope that we can &apos;t do that . 
Some people say you should even do it , not just at insurance , because you can &apos;t do it lazy , so you can eat on , because you know you can eat heart surgery , you can save you . 
I know not whether that &apos;s smart . If you look at the importance of this problem , you can see . But it &apos;s now a discourse . In geoengineering , there &apos;s a discourse about whether to have that available . If the things get faster or faster , or this innovation takes longer than we expect . 
CA : Climate skeptics , do you have one or two sentences for those around you , perhaps to convince you ? 
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps . 
Those who are using scientific arguments are very little . 
Say , they &apos;re negative effects . There are negative effects associated with clouds . The things shift 
. It &apos;s very , very few things that you can even say . Of which there &apos;s a chance in a chance in a million . That &apos;s 
the main problem here , like the AIDS problem . 
You make the mistake . Now , and you pay very much for it much later . 
And that &apos;s why the idea is , now , if you can solve all sorts of urgent problems , to invest in something that you &apos;re going to have later on , and then the investment doesn &apos;t get so clear . In fact , the IPCC Report is not necessarily the worst scenario . And it &apos;s people in the world of rich people who are getting to see IPCC and say , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s not a big drama . The 
fact is that these uncertainty is giving us cause for concern . 
But my dream here is that my dream here is that if you can make it economically and at the same time eliminate CO2 , then the skeptics are saying . Okay . It &apos;s interesting to me not that it doesn &apos;t emit CO2 . I wish I almost wanted it to do that . But I &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper , than the previous method , I think . CA 
: And that would be your answer to that . That &apos;s Björn Lomborg &apos;s argument that if you were to spend all this time and energy to use the CO2 problem to solve it . All of the other goals are suffering . The poverty reduction , the fight against malaria and so on , so that it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources , money to invest in it , while it &apos;s better things that we can do . 
BG : Well , actual spending on malaria research is , let &apos;s say , the U.S. should . Ten billion per year . More spending than you spend today than you do . That &apos;s not the dramatic thing . Underneath 
it should be other things that should not suffer . 
You come along to big amounts of money . And here you can have reasonable people contradictory . If you do have something that &apos;s not economically sound and you try to finance that . For me , this is where most waste happens . It &apos;s 
unless you &apos;re very , very close to a breakthrough in cost and you &apos;re financing it . Only one more learning curve . I think we should do more things . We should try to have the potential , very , much cheaper . 
If the swab is the one you get , a very high energy price , then only the rich can keep up . 
I mean , each of us here could have five times as much for our energy , spend without having to live in a way that changes our way of life . For 
the lower two billion , but is it a disaster ? And 
even Lomborg . Think about 
his new mesh is , now why is the new research not going to be discussed ? He 
&apos;s always going to be discussed because of his earlier stories with the skeptic camp . But he has understood that this is one very lonely group of people . And that &apos;s why he &apos;s now bringing the research argument . 
And that &apos;s a thought that he &apos;s advocating for , I think , appropriate . 
The research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little support does it get . 
CA : Bill . I think I &apos;m speaking for almost . Everybody , everybody here . If I say , &quot; I really hope you really want to see your wish come true . &quot; Thank you very much . 
BG : Thank you . 
I would like to give you a little bit of what I was told a few months ago when I wrote an article for Italian . Wired noticed that I noticed when I wrote . 
I always have my synonymous dictionary ready for use . But I was with the editing of the text already done . And I noticed that I was doing something I &apos;ve never seen in my life . What that word hinders really means , &quot; I 
read you the entry , disabled . 
&quot; Object : Curved . Helpless , useless . Destroyed . Deceased , mutilated . Wounded , prepared , paralyzed , separated . Keep , worn out , weakened , impotent , castrated , paralyzed . Hangandicapt , senil , age @-@ weak , withdrawn , repaired , done , broken . Gentlemen , counted ( see also injured , useless and weak ) 
Anonyme , healthy , strong , powerful I have 
these lists on my list with a friend &apos;s mouth and I had to laugh first . It worked like this ridiculous . But I came only until I was prepared and couldn &apos;t do any more and had to stop reading and stop reading . First of all , collect after this invincible flood of words and the 
emotional shock that it causes . Of course , this was a frayed old synonym dictionary . I have become just wondering that I was going to do the output 
pretty old . But actually , it was an issue . It was early &apos; 80s when I was just talking to primary school . And with it , my self @-@ image outside of my family environment started to build and shape . And also in terms of other kids and other kids and the rest of the world around me . 
And God be thankful . Have I got no synonymous dictionary at that time ? Would 
I use this entry seriously ? Would I be into a world where I was born of someone like me as a person who would perceive life in no way positive in any way ? Today , however , I &apos;m going to vote for the opportunities and adventures I &apos;ve experienced . 
So I &apos;ve been immediately celebrating the online edition of 2009 , and I expected that I would be able to make a more appealing contribution here . 
Here &apos;s the updated version . This entry , 
unfortunately , is not much better . In particular , 
I &apos;ve been shocked by the last two words under Near Anonyms , &quot; All right and Healthy . &quot; 
But it &apos;s not just about the issue of the words . 
It &apos;s about what we &apos;re talking about about people , the people we think about with these words . 
It &apos;s about the values that we have in these words . And how we &apos;re going to construct those values , how we &apos;re going to influence 
our language . Our thinking and how we &apos;re going to influence the world and people around us . 
A lot of ancient societies , including Greeks and Greeks and Romans , really believed that the way the debate about a curse is a powerful force , because what you &apos;re saying loud is also manifesting itself , can be manifested . 
So what do we actually want to manifest ? Well , a disabled person or a powerful person alone , already a 
human being mindless as a child , could be enough to limit them and give them ideas . Too imposing it would 
not be more beautiful to open doors to them . Too 
much a human being who for me has opened doors was my pediatrician . AM : A.I. DuPont Institute in the Wilmington Institute in Delaware . 
He &apos;s called Dr. Pizzutillo , an Italo @-@ American whose name is , you can think , like you . The majority of Americans are not saying correctly . So it became always Dr. P. 
P. called . And Dr. P. wore always very much colorful flies and was always very popular for working with kids , just like it was created . 
I found the time that I found in this hospital that I spent . Simply great . Until the time I was physiotherapy . 
I had to do some exercises , seemingly infinitely . With these thick , elastic bands in different colors , you know , that &apos;s around my leg muscles . And I have these bands more than hated than anything else . I have them hated . I have them cursed . I have them hated . 
And imagine if you can , I have even already been as a kid of five . With Dr. P. , negotiated . And so this is how these exercises try to stop . Natural , without success . 
And one day , he has me at a one of my exercises . These exercises were simple , tiring , merciless . And he said to me , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you &apos;re such a strong . Strong and young girl . You &apos;re going to be one of those tapes one day . And 
when you break it , give it to you a hundred dollars . &quot; 
That was , of course , just a simple trick by Dr. P. to get the exercises done , which I don &apos;t want to do , with the prospect that the richest five @-@ year @-@ old girl in the hospital will be on the second floor . But he has me actually to do that , actually , to bring my daily exercise horror with new eyes . So this has turned into a new and promising experience . 
And I ask myself today , how much his vision of the world as strong and powerful as me is . Young girl , my self @-@ image , has shaped me like this , and I could imagine myself as one of nature &apos;s strong , powerful and atlethic people . That &apos;s just one 
example . From many , like adults in power positions , the imagination of a child can inspire . But how the imagination of a child can 
be inspired by the examples already cited from the synonymous dictionaries shows us that our language doesn &apos;t allow us any space to imagine something . What we &apos;re all hoping for would be for each and every one of us to be able to make ourselves a powerful human being . 
Our language is lagging behind social change . It &apos;s lagging behind in many cases through technological change , which has been triggered by a change in our society . 
From medical standpoint , from a medical standpoint , of course , you can say that my legs , laser surgery for visually impaired visually impaired , knee joints made of titanium and artificial hip joints for aging bodies , which allow people to really use all their possibilities and to cross the boundaries that their natural destiny has set them apart , are not even talking about social networking platforms . People allow themselves to have their own identity , give themselves to their own way , define themselves and 
thereby become globally involved , groups @-@ oriented , which they themselves can 
choose . Perhaps this is a technological shift that makes it clearer than ever that it has always been another truth . That is , that every person who lives in society has something very special and very powerful to give , and that human ability to adapt . Our greatest plus is 
the human being &apos;s ability to adapt . That &apos;s a really interesting story because people are always telling me about it , asking me to tell me how to deal with adversity . And I &apos;m going to confess something to you : This sentence has never fit me . And I &apos;ve never always been very uncomfortable . So I &apos;ve felt the questions of people about answering them . And I think gradually , I understand why this 
sentence from the way we deal with adversity lives . From the idea that success or success or happiness depends on a challenge to master without having to deal with the associated experience , the challenge to it . As if my life is so successful , it &apos;s because I &apos;ve been able to traps in a life with a prosthetic , or , like , any human being , with my disability , perceive me . 
But the truth is that we have to change . Of course , we are facing the challenge . No matter whether you &apos;re physical , emotional or even both . 
And I &apos;m saying that &apos;s good , right ? Distress is not an obstacle that we curve . 
It &apos;s not an obstacle that we have to curve to make our lives clearer . Distress is just 
an adversity that belongs to our lives . 
And I tend to be adversaries as my shadow . 
Sometimes I realize that he &apos;s very present . Sometimes he &apos;s hardly too visible . But he &apos;s constantly at me . 
And I want to make no sense of that . The impact , or the severity , of the fight of a human being . It &apos;s in life 
adversity and adversity and challenges . And the ones are all too real . And each person goes with it differently , right ? But the question is not whether or not we can deal with adversity clearly or not , but how we can deal with it clearly . 
We are , therefore , not only responsible for that . The people who we love before we hit fate , but also to keep them ready to do that . Good . 
So , to be clear . And we are doing our children no favours . If we give them the feeling that we are feeling they are not able to adapt . 
You have to do two things clearly . Let &apos;s start with the medical fact that you &apos;re amputee and secondly , the social opinion about it . Whether I &apos;m disabled or not , I &apos;m disabled . 
And to be honest , the truth is , the only real and lasting disability that I have to deal with is the fact that the world is constantly saying . It can tell me with these definitions . 
In our desire to make people understand how to protect the people that care about us and to give them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis , or even a prognosis about quality of life that they expect , they need to . We need to be careful not to lay the foundation for us to actually obstruct somebody from being disabled . 
Maybe it &apos;s the current concept that &apos;s just looking at what &apos;s going to break in a broken . And how we do that , repair it for each individual , greater disability than pathology , for 
each one of us . If we have a person not holistically treated and not all of his forces and possibilities and possibilities . And acknowledge creates , in addition to the natural struggle , the natural struggle that you may need to have . 
A further disease . We degrade one person who is responsible for our society , a person who is valued . 
So we need to talk about patology beyond patology and look at the whole range of areas of human possibilities . 
At the very most important point , though , is that there is a gap between perception of our inadequacies and our great inventive spirit . 
A connection exists , we should connect these challenging times , not devalue or deny . We should not try to try to avoid them . We should not try to avoid them , nor should we sweep them under the carpet , but rather , to identify opportunities in adversity . 
It &apos;s my maybe more about looking at the odds that I think we don &apos;t necessarily overcome adversity , but that we need to be open to it , embrace it , hug it , grab it in the head , and also use a campaign expression , and maybe even dance with it . 
And maybe we can do adversity , as something natural , coherent and useful , to see and feel like this , through their presence , not anymore , so burdened . In 
this year , we celebrate the 200th anniversary of Charles &apos; Darwin . And when he was 150 years ago about evolution , he wrote about evolution , Darwin , in my eyes , has something very true in human character . I would like 
to rewrite it that way , not the strongest of his kind survives , nor does he survive the smartest of his kind , but of the one that can best adapt to change . 
From conflicts , creativity does not only emerge 
from Darwin &apos;s work . Knowledge , we know that the ability of man to survive and flourish from struggle of the human mind . Determined is the struggle of conflict to change . 
So again , change and adaptation are the greatest abilities of the human being . 
And maybe you know , first of all , what wood ? We carved are when we really are tested . 
Maybe it &apos;s that that &apos;s the meaning of adversity . It &apos;s that perception of the ego , a sense of our own power . 
We can feel that way ourselves . 
We can give ourselves something to adversity , a new meaning , that goes beyond difficult times . 
Maybe we can give adversity as change . 
Adversity stands for a change in the way we feel like we don &apos;t yet adapted . 
I think that the greatest damage that we do to ourselves is the greatest damage we believe 
we do normal , that we should be normal . Let &apos;s face it . Who is normal ? 
It &apos;s not normal . 
It &apos;s normal . It &apos;s typical . But it &apos;s not normal , and would you use this poor , gray person ? Really , get to know this ? 
If it does , you would really like to know it . I think there &apos;s not . 
It would be great . If we did this paradigm of normality against a different one , the possibility or the strength . To do it even another bit , a little more dangerous , to put it in a way , to exchange . So you can do that , you know , by releasing the forces of very many children and inviting them to exchanging their very special and valuable skills into society . 
Anthropolgen has found out that we have human beings from members of our society , one thing that we &apos;ve always demanded of us is to be useful and to contribute . 
It &apos;s evidence that there are already some Neanderthals who , 60 000 years ago , older people and people with severe physical injuries , were carrying with them . And that &apos;s perhaps because the Neandertaler experience in survival struggle of these people for society is valuable to society . 
They have these people not as people who have broken . And useless . They &apos;ve been seen as something special and valuable , and they &apos;ve been treated as something special . Before 
a few years ago , I went to the city , the city where I grew up , to a food market . In that Red Zone , in the northeast of Pennsylvania . And I stood there in front of a cup of tomatoes . 
It was summer . And I had shorts on and 
I had shorts , and I hear a guy behind me say , &quot; &quot; Well , if that &apos;s not Aimee Mullins , 
and I turn around and I see this older man . &quot; I had no idea who he was . 
And I meant , &quot; Excuse me . &quot; Sir , do we know ? I can &apos;t get involved with you . And 
he said , &quot; Well , you should hardly remember that I was . &quot; When 
I saw you for the first time , I saw you out of my belly of her mother . &quot; 
Oh . So , that ? &quot; 
&quot; And of course , it &apos;s got it , but click . 
&quot; That was Dr. Kean . A man who I only made of narratives of my mother about this day , because I knew about this day , of course , very typical of my birthday , two weeks late . The doctor for prenatal diagnostics of my mother was in vacation , 
and I was very happy to see that . And so we knew my parents knew the man who made me born , the man who gave me a birth . 
And because I was without a calf &apos;s legs . And my feet , after them , were facing , and I was just a few toes on this and one and a few toes . AM THE OTHER foot was he was the carrier . This stranger had to take the bad news . 
He said to me , &quot; I had to tell your parents that you never would walk and never walk like that . His would be like other kids or that you never would be an independent life . And since then , they &apos;ve just lied to me . They &apos;ve really punished me . Exceptional 
. I found that he &apos;s going to cut out newspaper clips of my entire childhood . No matter whether I was competing for a letter in second grade , whether I was winning with the scout scouts at the parade , Halloween , traveling with the scouts . No matter whether I was a scholarship or one of my sporting victories , And he used this clip to make his students go to teach . Medical students from Hahnemann Medical School , and the Hershey Medical School , 
And he called this part of his course the X factor factor , the potential of human will . 
You can just not do enough to emphasize how crucial this factor is to the quality of life of a human being . 
And Dr. Kean told us . He said , &quot; I learned that children , if they don &apos;t do something else all the time . And so even if they just do a little bit of support , if you kids themselves are left behind . &quot; Then you can have kids achieve a lot . See 
, Dr. Kean has his thinking changed . 
He had understood that the medical care diagnosis and how someone could do with it was 
two different things . And also , I have my thinking . In the course of time , I have changed . When you change me at the age of 15 , you would have asked me if I could have my prostheses against legs made of meat and bone . Then I would not have hesitated for a second . 
I wanted to do it normally at that time . 
If you would have me ask that today , I &apos;m not so sure . 
And that &apos;s what happened because I did something with my legs . And not despite that experience . And maybe I could have done that change 
because I was so many people I met because I met doors open to me instead of people opening up to me , and not people restricting me or overtaking an idea . 
See , you . It takes really just one person . It takes you to demonstrate how you can manifest your forces . And you &apos;re through . 
If you do it to someone , you can make their own inner forces activated . The human mind is like this receptive . If you do that , and for someone in a critical way , at a critical moment , you open a door . Then you &apos;re for those people . 
Very good teachers . You bring them to bear with yourself doors to open to 
themselves , the real meaning of the word . Educate is rooted in the word educe . It 
means something to produce that in a person who has the potential to tickle 
out , again , what potential do we want to retrieve now ? 
In the &apos; 60s , in the United Kingdom , a case study was conducted . Back then , high schools were transformed into schools . 
They call this there streaming trials . In the United States , we call this tracking . 
The students are being trained in grades . 
And the A students are being orally harder to get tested , the better teachers , etc . 
, and they then have three months of time to teach students with enough grade , very good . It was given to them . They were told that they were aces , they were very smart . And after these three months , they got really one . 
And of course , it breaks you the heart to hear that the other way around , the one @-@ serer students were told . They were just enough . And 
the same was the case . After the three months , but after only 
those who always were still in the school , they were . Apart from the students who were the school school 
school , quite crucial . With this study , it was that teachers were not inaugurated . 
The teachers knew not that something was changed . 
They were just told that they were the Einser students and that they were the students with the grade enough . And just as they gave them something , they taught them . And they treated 
the only real thing that &apos;s disabled is a broken mind . A spirit that &apos;s broken has broken has no hope anymore . It finds nothing more . Beautiful . It lacks . Our natural , childish curiosity . And our innate ability to imagine imagination , 
if we do , but we can do it , to help the human mind to continue to hope , to hope for itself and other people around it , to find beautiful . Curiously and imaginatively , to be curious and imaginative , then we really put our forces into a positive position . 
If a spirit is about these qualities , then we can have a new reality and new forms of existence . 
I want to talk to you about a poem that &apos;s written by a Persian poet named Hafiz in the 14th century . And by the one that my friend Jacques Dembois tells me about , and the poem is called &quot; The God Who Only Words Four . &quot; Every child knows God , not the God of the name , not the God of prohibitions , but the God of the God who knows only four words . And these are repeated all the time . He says , &quot; Just 
come dance with me . &quot; &quot; Come dance with me . Thank you very much . &quot;
